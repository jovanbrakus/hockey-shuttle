# Ethan Price - Main Protagonist

## Basic Information
- **Age**: 17 (senior year)
- **Nickname**: Price, E (teammates), Ethan (everyone else - hates nicknames from non-athletes)
- **Birthday**: July 22nd
- **Height**: 6'1"
- **Ethnicity**: White
- **Sports**: Hockey (AAA team, center position)
- **Academic Focus**: AP Physics, AP Calc BC, AP Bio (secretly wants engineering)
- **Current City**: Metro City (since age 9)

## Core Psychology

### The Want
To make everyone proud - parents, coaches, teammates, girlfriend, school. To be the perfect package: star athlete, popular guy, future NHL prospect.

### The Need
To choose his own path and accept that disappointing people is sometimes necessary. To value his own dreams as much as others' expectations.

### The Lie
"If I'm successful enough, if I make everyone happy, I'll be happy too. My own wants are selfish when so many people are counting on me."

### The Truth
Living for others' dreams isn't noble - it's a slow suffocation. His intelligence and curiosity aren't distractions from hockey; they're essential parts of who he is.

### The Ghost
Age 9: His parents' faces when the AAA coach said "elite potential" - pure joy and pride he'd never seen before. He's been chasing that look ever since, even when hockey became obligation more than love.

### The Voice
Ethan's internal monologue is compartmentalized - one voice for the public performance, another buried deeper that questions everything. He's hyper-aware of being watched, so his thoughts are often about managing perceptions until Sophia disrupts that pattern.

## Personality Traits

### Strengths
- Natural leader without arrogance
- Genuinely kind, not performatively nice
- Brilliant analytical mind (hockey IQ translates to everything)
- Loyal once committed
- Emotionally intelligent despite suppressing it
- Remembers small details about people
- Graceful under scrutiny

### Flaws
- People-pleaser to his own detriment
- Conflict-avoidant until explosion point
- Compartmentalizes rather than confronts
- Assumes he knows what others need
- Pride about handling everything alone
- Dismisses his own exhaustion
- Struggles to say no

### Contradictions
- Star athlete who'd rather be in physics lab
- Center of attention, feels completely alone
- Makes everyone comfortable, never relaxes
- Strategic on ice, impulsive with emotions
- Appears confident, constantly second-guessing
- Popular but has no one who truly knows him
- Future mapped out, dreams hidden

## Authentic Voice & Speech Patterns

### Internal Monologue Style
*Dual-tracked, hyper-aware of performance vs. truth*

"Smile. Nod. Yeah, great game, thanks man. Three more minutes of this and I can— 'Hey, Price, you coming to Reese's party?' Of course I'm going to Reese's party. I'm always going to Reese's party because that's what I do, I show up and I'm present and I make everyone—wait. Is that Sophia Chen? From Millbrook Sophia? Holy shit, when did she get tall? When did she—okay, focus. Reese is still talking. What did he... parties. Right. 'Wouldn't miss it.' And now I'm committed to three hours of noise when all I want to do is figure out why Soph is here and if she remembers the puck thing and—stop. You have a girlfriend. Who you care about. Mostly. Stop."

### Dialogue Patterns
- Smoothly deflects personal questions
- Hockey metaphors come naturally
- More questions than statements
- Adapts vocabulary to audience
- Genuine compliments to deflect attention
- Rare moments of pure honesty (usually with Sophia)

### Sample Dialogue
**With teammates (performance mode)**
"Dude, that shot was insane. No, seriously, you threaded that five-hole like—Carter, I'm not chirping you, take the compliment. We're gonna destroy Riverside Friday if you keep that up."

**With girlfriend Becca (caring but performing)**
"You look amazing, that color is perfect on you. Yeah, I can make it to dinner, just... let me check the practice schedule. I want to make sure I'm not letting anyone down. Including you, obviously."

**With Sophia (the real Ethan emerges)**
"Stop, stop, you're solving it the long way. Look—here, give me the pencil. See how if you just... yeah, exactly like that. God, remember when we used to race through those probability problems in what, fourth grade? You always saw the patterns faster. Still do. That's not—I'm not being nice, Soph, you're literally smarter than me and we both know it."

**When actual feelings leak through**
"I don't... I don't know how to explain this without sounding like an asshole. I have everything I'm supposed to want. Like, objectively, my life is exactly what I worked for. So why does it feel like I'm watching someone else live it?"

## Relationships

### With Parents
- **Dad (Robert Price)**: Former college hockey player, living through Ethan
- **Mom (Jennifer Price)**: Manages his schedule like a PR firm

## Hockey Context
- **Position**: Center (playmaker, not just scorer)

- **Specialty**: Reads the ice like chess, sees plays developing
- **Scouts Watching**: NHL and college programs
- **Real Passion**: The physics of the game, not the glory

## The Duality
Ethan exists in two worlds:
1. **Public Ethan**: Confident, accomplished, has it all together
2. **Real Ethan**: Exhausted, intellectually starving, quietly desperate

Sophia is the only person who sees both and doesn't need him to choose one.

## Evolution Notes
Ethan begins season 1 as a masterclass in compartmentalization - perfect boyfriend, perfect son, perfect athlete, perfect student (but not too perfect at school). Sophia's return doesn't just remind him of who he was; she shows him who he could be if he stopped performing. His arc is learning that authenticity isn't selfish - pretending is the real betrayal.

The kiss at season end isn't just romantic breakthrough - it's the first completely honest choice he's made in years.
