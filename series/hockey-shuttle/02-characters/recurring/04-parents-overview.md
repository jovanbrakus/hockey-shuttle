## Writing Guidelines for Parents

### DO:
- Make them three-dimensional
- Show they genuinely love their kids
- Demonstrate different manifestations of pressure
- Let them be wrong without being evil
- Show impact of their choices
- Give them own anxieties and fears

### DON'T:
- Make them cartoon villains
- Have them be completely absent
- Make them suddenly understand everything
- Let them off the hook too easily
- Forget they have their own lives
- Make them only obstacles

---

## Thematic Purpose

Parents represent:
- **External pressure** vs. internal desire
- **Different love languages** causing harm or healing
- **Generational expectations** and dreams
- **The cost** of living through your children
- **The gift** of trusting your children

The contrast between families shows that both extremes—too much pressure and too much space—can leave teens feeling alone. Ethan and Sophia each have what the other needs, which is part of why they work together.
