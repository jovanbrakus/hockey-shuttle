## Role in the Story
Maya is Sophia's entry point into the school beyond Ethan's world. She's the competitive best friend who challenges Sophia athletically and personally, representing the path of authentic belonging that doesn't require performing or connections.

## Core Psychology

### The Want
To win state championship in badminton and prove that "minor" sports deserve respect.

### The Need
To stop defining herself in opposition to others and accept that wanting recognition isn't shallow.

### The Lie
"Caring what people think makes you weak. True strength is complete independence."

### The Truth
Wanting to be seen and valued is human. Community and connection are strengths, not weaknesses.

## Personality Traits

### Strengths
- Fiercely competitive without cruelty
- Direct communication style
- Loyal to those who earn it
- Self-assured without arrogance
- Natural leader by example
- Excellent judge of character
- Passionate about her sport

### Flaws
- Can be too blunt/abrasive
- Pride prevents asking for help
- Dismissive of social politics (defensive)
- Holds grudges
- Intimidating when doesn't mean to be
- Struggles with vulnerability
- Assumes independence = strength always

### Contradictions
- Team captain who emphasizes individual performance
- Craves recognition while scorning popularity
- Confident in skills, insecure about social value
- Wants deep friendships, pushes people away
- Competitive but fair
- Tough exterior, surprisingly soft heart

## Authentic Voice & Speech Patterns

### Internal Monologue Style
*Direct, competitive analysis of everything, including relationships*

"New girl's footwork is sloppy - no, wait, that's not sloppiness, that's hockey stance bleeding through. Interesting. She's got the reflexes though. Good court vision. Probably not threat for #1 singles but could push me if she focused.

And she's got the whole school curious because apparently she knows Ethan Price from before he was Ethan Price™. Great. Another person who's gonna float through on connections while the rest of us work.

Except... she's not floating. She's actually working. And she's not performing for anyone. Huh."

### Dialogue Patterns
- Straightforward, minimal filler words
- Caribbean phrases when emotional or with family
- Sports metaphors but different from hockey ones
- Cuts through BS immediately
- Rare compliments mean everything
- Louder when passionate, quieter when serious

### Sample Dialogue
**First meeting Sophia at badminton tryouts**
"You're fast. Footwork's weird but you read the shuttle well. You play other racquet sports? No? Interesting. I'm Maya, captain. That was decent but you're dropping your racquet head on backhand. Fix that and you're varsity. Maybe."

**Calling out social dynamics**
"Okay, real talk? I don't care who you know or who thinks you're cool. On this court, none of that matters. You're either good enough or you're not. And 'good enough' means you're willing to work when no one's watching. That's it. That's the whole speech."

**Letting guard down with Sophia (later)**
"You know what's wild? Badminton is literally one of the fastest racquet sports, requires insane reflexes and endurance, and people still call it a 'backyard game.' Meanwhile hockey players get parades. Not that I'm bitter. Okay, I'm a little bitter. But like, productively bitter."

**About Ethan situation (direct truth)**
"So you have feelings for guy who has girlfriend. Guy clearly has feelings back. You're both doing the 'noble suffering' thing instead of being honest. Cool, cool. Very mature. Or you could, like, actually talk about it? Just a thought. What do I know, I just call it like I see it."

**When actually vulnerable (rare)**
"Sometimes I wonder if I'm just... too much, you know? Too intense, too competitive, too loud. And then I think, screw that, everyone else is too timid. But also... it'd be nice if someone wanted to be around me without me having to prove myself first."

## Dialogue Showcase - Maya & Sophia

**Scene: After Maya sees Ethan and Sophia at rink**

**Maya**: "You like him."

**Sophia**: "We're friends. He has a—"

**Maya**: "Girlfriend, yeah, I know. Becca Martinez, student council, perfect hair, the whole package. Doesn't change what I said. You like him."

**Sophia**: "It doesn't matter. It's complicated."

**Maya**: "It's only complicated if you make it complicated. You like him. He clearly likes you based on the way he looks at you like you invented physics. He has girlfriend he's with out of habit or guilt or whatever. These are facts. What you do with facts? That's the only interesting question."

**Sophia**: "When did you become a relationship expert?"

**Maya**: "Girl, I analyze court positioning and opponent psychology for fun. You think I can't read basic human dynamics? Please. I'm not saying blow up his relationship. I'm saying stop pretending you don't feel what you feel. That's just lying to yourself, and you're too smart for that."

**Sophia**: "What if being honest ruins everything?"

**Maya**: "What if lying ruins everything slower? At least honest is quick pain. This martyrdom thing you're both doing? That's slow torture. And frankly, it's boring to watch. Be brave on the court, be brave in life. Same skillset."

## Evolution Notes
Maya starts as the intimidating captain who Sophia must win over, but becomes the friend who sees and values exactly who Sophia is - no performance required. Her own arc about vulnerability and community parallels Sophia's journey about authentic connection.

She's the friend who will tell you the hard truth and then help you be brave enough to act on it. She represents the power of choosing yourself while still building real community.
