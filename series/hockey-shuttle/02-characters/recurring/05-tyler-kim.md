# Tyler Kim - The Setup Attempt

## Basic Information
- **Age**: 17 (senior year)
- **Nickname**: Ty, Kim
- **Birthday**: April 9th
- **Height**: 6'0"
- **Ethnicity**: Korean-American (second generation)
- **Sports**: Hockey (AAA team, right wing)
- **Academic Focus**: AP Business, AP Econ
- **Social Position**: Popular athlete, Ethan's friend

## Role in the Story
Tyler is Ethan's teammate who Ethan sets up with Sophia in his attempt to "help her get a boyfriend." He's genuinely nice, objectively dateable, and absolutely wrong for Sophia - which makes the whole situation complicated and revealing for everyone involved.

## Core Psychology

### The Want
To have senior year romance, be good teammate, maintain social status.

### The Purpose in Story
Tyler represents the "should work on paper" relationship. He's nice, attractive, shares interests with Sophia, and there's zero chemistry. His existence forces both Sophia and Ethan to confront what they actually want vs. what makes logical sense.

## Personality Traits

### Strengths
- Genuinely kind
- Good sense of humor
- Confident without arrogance
- Solid friend
- Emotionally available
- No red flags whatsoever

### Why It Doesn't Work
- Too eager to please
- Conversations stay surface level
- Tries too hard to impress
- Doesn't challenge her intellectually
- Chemistry is completely absent
- Nice but not right

## Authentic Voice & Speech Patterns

### Dialogue Style
Friendly, enthusiastic, slightly tries too hard

**On dates with Sophia**
"So Ethan mentioned you're amazing at badminton? That's so cool. I've never actually watched competitive badminton but I'd totally come to one of your matches if you want. I mean, no pressure, but like, I'd be into it."

**With teammates**
"Yo, Ethan, your friend Sophia is really cool. Like, actually smart and funny, not just hot. Good looking out, man."

**When sensing it's not working**
"Hey, so... I feel like maybe this is more friend vibes than date vibes? Which is totally cool. No weirdness. You're awesome, I just think maybe we're not, like, the right fit? Still cool though, right?"

## Relationship with Sophia

### How It Starts (Episode 4)
- Ethan suggests Tyler might be good match
- Tyler's interested immediately
- They have coffee, study together
- Few dates that are fine but flat
- Everyone thinks they're cute together
- Both know something's missing

### The Problem
- Nothing is wrong
- He's perfect on paper
- They should work
- But there's no spark
- No intellectual electricity
- Comfortable but not exciting

### How It Ends (Episode 6)
- Mutual acknowledgment it's not working
- Tyler is mature about it
- No drama, no hurt feelings
- Becomes friends instead
- Both relieved

### The Real Function
The Tyler experiment forces Sophia to realize:
- She's not looking for "nice guy who checks boxes"
- She wants someone who challenges her mind
- She wants someone who makes conversation electric
- She wants Ethan

And forces Ethan to realize:
- Watching her date someone else is torture
- Even when that someone is his friend
- Even when it "makes sense"
- He doesn't want to help her find someone else

## Key Scenes

### Episode 4: The Setup
**Ethan**: "Tyler's a great guy. Smart, funny, plays hockey so you'd have stuff to talk about. Want me to introduce you?"

**Sophia**: "You're... setting me up? With your teammate?"

**Ethan**: "I mean, you said you wanted to meet people. Tyler's good people. Plus then you'd come to more games, which would be cool. For the team. Team support."

**Sophia**: "Right. Team support."

### Episode 5: The Date That Works Too Well (For Everyone Else)
*Sophia and Tyler at coffee shop, Ethan watching from across room pretending to study*

**Tyler**: "So you switched from hockey to badminton when you were nine? That's random."

**Sophia**: "Yeah, it was... a change I needed to make."

**Tyler**: "Cool, cool. Both are intense sports. I respect the grind."

*Conversation continues pleasantly. Sophia glances at Ethan. Ethan looks away quickly. Jordan walks by Ethan's table.*

**Jordan**: "This is painful to watch, dude."

**Ethan**: "I'm studying."

**Jordan**: "You're torturing yourself. Same thing?"

### Episode 6: The Mutual Release
**Tyler**: "Okay, real talk. You're awesome. Like, objectively awesome. But I feel like we're both here because it makes sense, not because we're actually into each other. Right?"

**Sophia**: "Oh thank god you said it. Yes. You're great, Tyler. Really. But—"

**Tyler**: "No spark. It's cool. I felt it too. Or didn't feel it, I guess. We good?"

**Sophia**: "So good. Friends?"

**Tyler**: "Already there. Also, for what it's worth? Ethan's been weird since we started hanging out. Just... that's a thing I noticed."

**Sophia**: "He set us up."

**Tyler**: "Yeah, weird move for a guy who watches you like you're the only person in every room. But what do I know."

## Relationships with Others

### With Ethan
- Good teammates, casual friends
- No hard feelings about Sophia
- Actually thinks the whole thing is funny in retrospect
- Chirps Ethan about it later
- Supportive when Ethan finally admits feelings

### With Team
- Solid player, well-liked
- Not inner circle but included
- Good wingman on and off ice
- Drama-free presence

### With Becca's Friend Group
- Dates Morgan briefly after Sophia
- That actually has chemistry
- His real romance happens parallel to main plot

## Physical Mannerisms
- Easy smile
- Relaxed posture
- Hockey player confidence
- Friendly eye contact
- Nothing distinctive (that's the point)

## The Meta Purpose

Tyler exists to show:
1. **For Readers**: Not every nice guy is the right guy
2. **For Sophia**: What "should work" vs. what she actually wants
3. **For Ethan**: The torture of watching her with someone else
4. **For Plot**: Catalyst for both to confront real feelings

He's not an obstacle or a villain. He's a genuinely good person who's simply not her person. That's actually harder to deal with than if he were awful.

## Character Growth
Tyler's brief arc shows:
- Maturity in recognizing incompatibility
- Emotional intelligence to end it cleanly
- Ability to stay friends after dating
- Finding his actual match (Morgan)

He models healthy teenage relationship dynamics - sometimes it just doesn't work, and that's okay.

## Why This Matters

In YA romance, there's often the "wrong guy" who's either:
- Obviously terrible (reader knows immediately)
- Perfect but boring (plot obstacle)

Tyler is neither. He's genuinely good and would be great for someone - just not Sophia. This makes the situation more realistic and more complicated. Sophia can't point to anything wrong with him, which makes her have to admit what's actually true: she wants someone else.

## Dialogue Showcase - Group Dynamics

**Scene: Hockey team dinner, Episode 5**

**Jordan**: "So Kim finally got a girlfriend. Miracles happen."

**Tyler**: "We're just seeing how it goes. She's cool though."

**Ethan**: "Yeah, Soph's great." *too enthusiastic*

**Tyler**: "You okay, man? You've been weird about this."

**Ethan**: "What? No. I'm the one who suggested it. I'm happy for you guys."

**Jordan**: *under breath* "Yeah, you look thrilled."

**Tyler**: "Dude, if it's weird because we're friends or whatever—"

**Ethan**: "It's not weird. Why would it be weird? Date whoever you want. I'm good."

**Tyler**: "Okay, but you're like, aggressively good. Which is kind of suspicious."

**Jordan**: "Leave him alone, he's processing."

**Ethan**: "Processing what? There's nothing to process. Everybody eat your food."

## Season 1 Arc

**Episode 4**: Introduction, the setup, first date
**Episode 5**: Brief dating period, everyone watching
**Episode 6**: Mutual breakup, stays friends
**Episodes 7-10**: Background friend, occasional wingman, finds Morgan

Tyler's subplot resolves cleanly, making space for main romance to develop while showing that:
- Not all breakups are dramatic
- Sometimes people just aren't right for each other
- You can want someone to be happy without being bitter
- Real connection can't be forced or logical

*"You can't logic your way into chemistry. Either it's there or it's not. And it's definitely not here. Which is fine! But like, maybe figure out where it actually is?"* - Tyler's wisdom
