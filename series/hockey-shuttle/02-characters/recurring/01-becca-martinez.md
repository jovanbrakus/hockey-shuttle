## Basic Information
- **Age**: 17 (senior year)
- **Nickname**: Bec, B (friends), Rebecca (parents only)
- **Birthday**: November 3rd
- **Height**: 5'7"

## Core Psychology

### Not a Villain
**IMPORTANT**: Becca is NOT the mean girl obstacle. She's a real person with legitimate feelings who happens to be in a relationship that's dying a slow death neither person has acknowledged yet.

### The Want
To maintain the perfect senior year she's orchestrated - great boyfriend, college acceptance, legacy at school, friend group intact.

### The Need
To build an identity beyond being "perfect" and accept that losing control isn't the same as failing.

### The Lie
"If I plan everything perfectly and maintain my image, I can control my future and happiness."

### The Truth
Perfection is a performance, and she's exhausted. Real connection requires vulnerability, not curation.

## Personality Traits

### Strengths
- Genuinely organized and capable
- Kind to people outside her social circle (when others aren't watching)
- Actually smart, not just good at school
- Loyal to her inner circle
- Self-aware about her privilege
- Natural leader without cruelty
- Protective of her friends

### Flaws
- Image-obsessed to detriment of authenticity
- Performs happiness instead of feeling it
- Competitive about things that don't matter
- Struggles to be vulnerable
- Assumes relationships should look a certain way
- Ignores problems until they explode
- Measures worth by external validation

### Contradictions
- Popular but lonely at the top
- Confident appearance, constant anxiety
- Controls everything, feels powerless
- Values authenticity, can't show it
- Loves Ethan but doesn't know him
- Perceptive about others, blind to herself

## Authentic Voice & Speech Patterns

### Internal Monologue Style
*Controlled, list-making, hyper-aware of appearances*

"Okay, lunch seating: me and Ethan center table, Morgan and Tyler next to us, that puts the captains together which photographs well for yearbook. Wait, is Ethan doing that thing where he's physically here but mentally in physics class? No. Stop. He's fine, we're fine, everything is fine. This is senior year, the best year, exactly like I planned. Except he's definitely not listening. And I'm narrating my own life like a documentary again. Great. Perfect. Totally normal."

### Dialogue Patterns
- Upbeat with subtle edge when threatened
- Uses "we" instead of "I" (Ethan and I, our plans)
- Punctuates with "right?" seeking agreement
- Sophisticated vocabulary in groups
- More vulnerable one-on-one (rare)

### Sample Dialogue
**With friends (performance mode)**
"So I was thinking we do the photoshoot at Golden Hour, right? Everyone in coordinating colors, nothing too matchy but like, elevated casual? Morgan, you'd look amazing in that burgundy top, and Tyler, maybe the—yes, exactly that one. Perfect."

**With Ethan (sensing distance)**
"You've been quiet lately. No, you have. Is it the scouts? Hockey stress? Because you know you can talk to me, right? That's what I'm here for. We're a team. Right?"

**When actually vulnerable (rare)**
"Do you ever feel like you're playing a part? Like, I know what I'm supposed to do and say and want, but sometimes I wonder if I actually... sorry. That's dumb. Forget it."

**Meeting Sophia (polite threat)**
"Oh my god, you're Ethan's friend from when he was little! That's so sweet that you guys reconnected. He literally never mentioned you, which is so weird because apparently you were like, super close? But I love that he's helping you meet people. He's good at that - making people feel included. It's one of his best qualities."

## Relationship with Ethan

### How They Got Together
- Started dating sophomore year
- She asked him to homecoming
- It made sense: popular + popular = perfect
- Everyone assumed they'd date eventually
- Neither questioned it, just went with momentum

### Current State (Season 1 Start)
- 14 months together
- They look perfect in photos
- Comfortable routine, declining passion
- He's her boyfriend, she's his girlfriend (roles, not people)
- Increasingly one-sided conversations
- She feels him pulling away, doesn't know why
- Neither brave enough to end it

### What She Doesn't See
- Ethan's intellectual starvation
- His dreams beyond hockey
- How much he's performing for everyone
- That he's lonely even with her
- She loves the idea of him, not the real him

### What She Does See
- He's distracted lately
- Sophia makes him light up differently
- Their relationship is more habit than heat
- She's holding on tighter as he drifts
- Something fundamental is wrong

## Evolution Through Season 1

### Episodes 1-4: Denial
- Notices Ethan's distraction
- Attributes it to hockey stress
- Tightens grip on relationship
- Subtly territorial around Sophia
- Performs happiness harder

### Episodes 5-7: Cracks
- Confronts Ethan about distance
- He reassures her (both know it's hollow)
- Starts seeing their relationship clearly
- Struggles with sunk cost fallacy
- Fear of being "the girl who got dumped"

### Episodes 8-10: Growth
- Realizes she's been performing too
- Starts questioning what she actually wants
- Has moment of real connection with unlikely person
- Sees Ethan and Sophia's chemistry
- Makes mature choice for herself (not just reaction)

## The Breakup Arc
**Key Point**: Becca needs to be active participant in ending relationship, not just victim of Ethan's choice.

- She knows it's over before he says it
- Chooses dignity over drama
- Honest conversation instead of public scene
- Hurt but not destroyed
- Her story continues beyond being his ex

## Complexity Notes

### Not The Mean Girl
- Doesn't sabotage Sophia out of cruelty
- Her reactions come from real hurt and confusion
- Protects her image but isn't vicious
- Capable of grace and pettiness simultaneously
- Readers should empathize even while rooting for Sophia/Ethan

### Her Own Arc
- Senior year identity crisis
- Pressure to be perfect from family
- First time facing real loss of control
- Learning who she is without performance
- Setting up her own growth story

## Physical Mannerisms
- Perfect posture always (trained from cheer)
- Adjusts hair when anxious
- Bright smile that doesn't reach eyes when faking
- Touches Ethan's arm possessively
- Takes candid photos constantly (curating memories)
- Stills completely when genuinely hurt

## Secret Truths
- Knows relationship is dying, too scared to let go
- Applied to colleges far away without telling anyone
- Envies Sophia's authenticity
- Sometimes wishes someone would make the hard choice for her
- Exhausted by her own perfection
- Has started journaling real thoughts (hidden)
- Respects Sophia more than she wants to admit

## Sample Scene - Becca's POV

*Watching Ethan help Sophia with physics homework in library*

"They're just studying. That's literally all that's happening. Ethan helps lots of people with homework, he's—

But he doesn't laugh like that when he explains kinetic energy to Tyler. He doesn't do that thing where he runs his hand through his hair because he's excited, not stressed. And he definitely doesn't look at anyone else like they just solved world hunger because they got a practice problem right.

I should go over there. Remind them I exist. Remind him who he's dating.

Except... what would I even say? 'Hey babe, stop looking at her like she's the most interesting person in the room?' Yeah, that'll definitely make me seem secure and not at all like I'm watching my perfect senior year dissolve in real time.

Morgan's texting me. Probably about the Valentine's dance committee meeting. I'm supposed to care about crepe paper colors and DJ playlists. I'm supposed to be planning the photo spots and the after-party and—

Ethan just leaned closer to see her work. His shoulder's touching hers.

When did he stop leaning toward me?"

## Becca's Truth
She's not the obstacle to true love - she's another teenager trying to maintain control in a life that's rapidly showing her how little control anyone really has. She deserves empathy, growth, and her own story beyond being "the ex-girlfriend."
