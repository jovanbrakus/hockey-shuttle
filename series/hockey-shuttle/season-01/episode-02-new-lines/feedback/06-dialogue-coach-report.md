# Episode 2 "New Lines" - Dialogue Authenticity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Episode 2 demonstrates strong foundational dialogue work with authentic teen interactions, but suffers from **excessive articulation** in emotional moments, **overly polished text messaging**, and **insufficient voice distinction** between characters. The dialogue is readable and engaging, but teens—especially when vulnerable—speak messier, interrupt more, and struggle to articulate feelings.

**Overall Grade: B+** (Strong readability, needs messier realism)

## Critical Dialogue Issues

### 1. **Teens Are Too Articulate in Emotional Moments**

**Problem Example (Chapter 1, Lines 183-188):**
```
"Having you back makes me remember who I was before everything got so 
planned out. You make me want to do the engineering thing again, actually 
try for MIT instead of just following the hockey path my parents paved."
```

**Why This Fails:**
- Too smooth, too organized, too self-aware
- No hesitation, no searching for words
- Reads like therapy session, not vulnerable teen confession

**Realistic Revision:**
```
"Having you back, it's like—I don't know. Like I remember who I was? 
Before everything got so... planned. You make me think about the 
engineering stuff again. MIT and all that. Instead of just—" 
He gestured vaguely. "The hockey path. The thing they paved."
```

### 2. **Text Messages Are Too Polished**

**Problem:** Perfect capitalization, punctuation, no typos

**Current:**
```
Ethan: How was practice?
Sophia: Good. Violent. Coach had us doing drills until we couldn't feel our legs.
```

**Realistic 2025:**
```
ethan: how was practice
sophia: violent lol
sophia: coach tried to kill us
sophia: cant feel my legs
```

**2025 Texting Realities:**
- Lowercase frequent
- Minimal punctuation
- "lol" "lmao" strategically used
- Multiple short messages

---

### 3. **Insufficient Messy Teen Speech Patterns**

**Missing:**
- False starts and restarts
- "Like," "I mean," "you know" (in moderation)
- Trailing off mid-thought
- "Does that make sense?"
- Using "thing" and "stuff" as placeholders

---

### 4. **Voice Distinction Problems**

**Character Analysis:**
- **Sophia (B+)**: Internal analysis strong, but too articulate when vulnerable
- **Ethan (B)**: Needs more frustration stammering, verbal tells
- **Maya (A-)**: Best voice distinction, supportive directness
- **Jordan (B-)**: Voice indistinct from Tyler/Marcus in group scenes
- **Becca (B)**: Careful word choice good, needs more moments where niceness cracks
