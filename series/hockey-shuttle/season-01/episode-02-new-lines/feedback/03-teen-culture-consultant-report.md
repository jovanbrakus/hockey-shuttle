# TEEN CULTURE CONSULTANT - EPISODE 2 "NEW LINES" AUTHENTICITY REPORT

## Executive Summary

Episode 2 demonstrates **strong foundational authenticity** with realistic teen dynamics, natural relationship progression, and genuine emotional complexity. However, there are critical areas where 2025 teen culture requires updates—particularly around **social media usage, texting patterns, digital communication norms, and contemporary slang**. The episode occasionally feels like it's set in 2018-2019 rather than 2025.

**Overall Authenticity Grade: B+** (Strong foundation, needs cultural updating)

## CRITICAL AUTHENTICITY GAPS

### 1. **Social Media Usage - MAJOR GAP**

**Problem:** The episode barely mentions social media beyond one Instagram reference. In 2025, for 16-17 year olds, social media is constant, ambient, and woven into every experience.

**Missing Elements:**
- When Ethan points at Sophia after his goal, there's minimal discussion of this being recorded, posted, going viral
- Post-game at Stella's: Zero mention of anyone posting food pics, checking phones
- No Stories posted throughout experiences

**Authentic 2025 Reality:**
- Phones checked constantly during conversations
- Stories posted throughout experiences (pre-game fit checks, during game clips, post-game food)
- Screenshots of texts shared with trusted friends
- Becca finding out about the goal-pointing would happen DURING the game via tagged Stories

**Recommendation:** Weave in ambient social media usage without making it the focus.

### 2. **Texting Patterns - MODERATE GAP**

**Problem:** The texting is too formal and complete for 2025 teens.

**Current Example:**
```
Ethan: "Test Friday?"
Sophia: "Yeah, derivatives and chain rule"
```

**Authentic 2025 Version:**
```
ethan: test friday??
sophia: yeah derivatives and chain rule
ethan: im dead
```

**2025 Texting Realities:**
- Lowercase is default for many teens
- Minimal punctuation
- Emoji/reactions are communication
- Messages sent rapid-fire, not composed as paragraphs

---

### 3. **The Goal-Pointing Moment Needs Digital Amplification**

**Current:** Ethan points at Sophia after scoring. Maya comments. They worry about Becca seeing.

**2025 Authentic Should Include:**
- Multiple people filming/photographing
- Someone posting to Instagram Story with tag/location
- Group chat exploding with comments
- Becca seeing it in real-time on her phone
- By end of game, clip has circulated widely
