# Chapter 4: Misheard

Monday morning arrived with the kind of cold that felt personal—wind cutting through Sophia's coat, her breath visible in angry little clouds, the Honda's heater refusing to work until she was halfway to school.

She'd spent Sunday with Maya consuming ice cream and watching bad movies and carefully not discussing Ethan Price. She'd also turned off Instagram notifications after the goal point video hit fifty reposts and her mentions became unmanageable. People had opinions. So many opinions. But now it was Monday and she had to face school and him and the aftermath of Saturday's game and that conversation in the parking lot.

*I play better because you were there. I always do.*

Sophia parked in her usual spot and sat for a moment, gathering courage. She could do this. She could see Ethan in the hallways and in class and act like everything was normal, like her heart wasn't trying to develop its own weather system every time he looked at her.

The school parking lot was its usual Monday chaos—too many cars, too little space, everyone moving slow because weekends made them soft. Sophia grabbed her backpack and headed for the main entrance, already planning her route to avoid certain hallways.

She made it approximately ten steps before Maya intercepted her.

"Morning," Maya said, falling into step. "You look terrible."

"Thanks. You're a great friend."

"I mean it lovingly. Did you sleep?"

"Some." Sophia had actually spent most of Sunday night staring at her ceiling, replaying Saturday on loop. The goal. The point. His leg against hers. Becca's careful questions. The parking lot almost-confession. "I'm fine."

"You're a terrible liar." Maya held open the door, letting a blast of warm air hit them. "For what it's worth, Jordan texted me last night. He wants to talk to you. About Ethan."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "What about Ethan?"

"He didn't say. Just said it was important and to find him before first period." Maya squeezed her arm. "Whatever it is, I'm backup. Just text if you need extraction."

They split up at the science wing—Maya heading to her locker, Sophia going in search of Jordan. She found him at his locker near the gym, sorting through approximately seventeen hockey-related items.

"Hey," she said, and he turned, looking relieved.

"Sophie. Good." He grabbed his backpack, shut his locker. "Walk with me? We should talk."

This sounded ominous. Sophia followed him toward the less-crowded back hallway, anxiety building with each step.

"So," Jordan said once they were relatively alone, "I need to tell you something. About Ethan. And I'm breaking about fifteen bro codes by doing this, but I think you should know."

"Okay...?"

"He's into you." Jordan said it bluntly, without preamble. "Like, really into you. Has been since you showed up three weeks ago."

Sophia's ribcage felt two sizes too small. "What?"

"He won't admit it—keeps calling you his friend, keeps trying to do the right thing with Becca—but it's obvious to everyone who has working eyes." Jordan leaned against a locker, watching her carefully. "I thought you should know. Because watching you two do this dance is painful and someone needs to just say it out loud."

"He has a girlfriend."

"I know. That's the problem." Jordan sighed. "Look, Becca's great. She's been great for him all summer. But since you showed up, he's been different. More himself. Less like he's performing all the time."

"Jordan, I can't—"

"I'm not telling you to do anything," Jordan interrupted. "I'm just giving you information so you can make informed decisions. Because I think you're into him too, and I think you're both torturing yourselves trying to be appropriate."

Sophia couldn't breathe. This was too much, too direct, too honest. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because Ethan's my friend and you're becoming my friend and I'm tired of watching you both be miserable." Jordan's expression softened. "Also because I overheard his parents at the game on Saturday. They were talking about you. About how you're 'problematic' for his focus. And I think you should know what you're dealing with."

The world tilted slightly. "Problematic?"

"Their word, not mine. His dad was saying something about how Ethan's been distracted since you got here, asking questions about MIT again, spending less time on hockey focus." Jordan hesitated. "His mom said they should 'manage the situation.' Whatever that means."

Sophia felt sick. She was the problem. The variable that didn't fit. And now Ethan's parents were actively planning to manage her out of his life.

"I should go," she said, backing away. "I have to—thanks for telling me, but I really need to—"

"Sophie." Jordan caught her arm gently. "Don't freak out. Just... be aware. And maybe talk to Ethan? Actually talk, not this thing you're both doing where you dance around everything?"

Sophia nodded, not trusting her voice, and escaped before she could do something humiliating like cry in the hallway. She made it to the bathroom, locked herself in a stall, and tried to process what Jordan had just told her.

Ethan was into her. His parents thought she was problematic. Everyone could apparently see what she'd been trying to hide.

And none of it mattered because he was with Becca and his parents were planning to manage the situation and Sophia was still just the complication in his perfectly planned life.

Her phone buzzed.

**maya:** *you okay?*

**maya:** *need extraction?*

**sophia:** *im fine*

**sophia:** *just needed a minute*

**sophia:** *see you in ap calc*

**maya:** *liar*

**maya:** *but okay*

**maya:** *im here when youre ready to talk*

Sophia took three deep breaths, fixed her ponytail, and headed to first period. She could do this. She could face the day and Ethan and all of it without falling apart.

She was getting really good at lying to herself.

---

AP Calculus was third period, which gave Sophia two full classes to catastrophize about seeing Ethan.

By the time she walked into the classroom, she'd prepared seventeen different facial expressions ranging from "completely normal" to "definitely didn't just learn you're into me and your parents think I'm problematic."

She settled on "focused on calculus and nothing else."

Ethan was already there, sitting in his usual seat three rows over. He looked up when she entered, smiled—that real smile, not the performance one—and Sophia felt her prepared expressions crumble.

Jordan's words echoed: *He's into you. Like, really into you.*

She managed a small wave and slid into her seat. Pulled out her textbook. Stared at it like differential equations were the most fascinating thing in the universe.

"Hey."

Sophia looked up. Ethan was standing beside her desk, backpack slung over one shoulder, looking uncertain in a way she'd never seen him look.

"Hey," she managed.

"Can we talk? After class?"

Her whole body pulsed. "Sure."

"Great. Good." He hesitated, like he wanted to say more, then nodded and went back to his seat.

The class lasted approximately seventeen years. Every time Sophia glanced over, Ethan was either staring at his textbook with intense focus or looking at her. They made eye contact three times. Each time felt like touching a live wire.

When the bell finally rang, Sophia gathered her stuff. Her fingers wouldn't cooperate with the zipper on her bag. Ethan was waiting by the door, and they fell into step together heading toward the cafeteria.

"So," he said once they were in the hallway. "About Saturday."

"Yeah?"

"I shouldn't have said that stuff. About playing better when you're watching. It was—" He ran a hand through his hair. "It was too much. I put you in a weird position."

"You didn't—"

"I did. You're trying to be my friend and I keep making it tangled." They stopped near the science wing lockers, creating a small pocket of space in the crowded hallway. "I'm sorry. I'm going to do better. Keep things... clearer."

Clearer. Right. Friend zone, established and maintained.

"Okay," Sophia said, even though something under her sternum was squeezing—hope or panic or both. "Clearer. Good."

"Good." Ethan smiled, but it looked painful. "So we're good?"

"We're good."

They weren't good. Nothing about this was good. But Sophia nodded anyway and let him walk away toward the cafeteria, toward Becca and his normal life, while she stood there trying to remember how to breathe.

Maya found her three minutes later, still standing in the same spot.

"What happened?" Maya demanded, steering her toward their usual lunch table.

"He wants to keep things clearer." Sophia slumped into her seat. "Friend zone, officially established."

"But Jordan said—"

"I know what Jordan said. But Ethan just made it very clear that we're friends and he's going to act like it." Sophia pulled out her lunch without seeing it. "Which is good. It's what I wanted. It's what should happen."

"Sophie—"

"I'm fine." Sophia took a bite of her sandwich, chewed mechanically. "Really. This is good. Clearer is better."

Maya looked like she wanted to argue, but Priya and Emma arrived with their lunch trays and the conversation shifted to badminton—their tournament was in five days, Coach wanted extra practice sessions, they needed to coordinate rides.

Sophia let the talk wash over her, grateful for the distraction. She could do this. Friend zone was safe. Friend zone was clear.

She just had to convince her heart to cooperate.

---

The week passed in a blur of careful distance.

Sophia and Ethan still studied together—they had that AP Calc test on Friday and neither of them was willing to let their grades slip—but it was different now. Clearer. They sat farther apart at the library tables. No more hand-holding across study desks. No more almost-confessions.

Just friendship. Clean, safe, exactly what everyone needed.

It was killing her.

Wednesday afternoon, between classes, Sophia found herself walking past the main hallway toward the gym. She wasn't spying. She was just... taking a different route to European History. The fact that it happened to go past where hockey players usually congregated was purely coincidental.

She heard Ethan's voice first, then Jordan's, coming from around the corner near the trophy cases. Sophia should keep walking. She should absolutely keep walking.

She stopped, pressing herself against the wall, and listened. Because apparently she was that person now.

"—can't keep doing this, man." Jordan's voice, frustrated. "You need to make a decision."

"I have made a decision." Ethan sounded tired. "Becca's great. We work. I'm not going to screw that up because I have feelings for someone I can't have."

Her lungs forgot how to work for a second. *Feelings for someone I can't have.*

"Why can't you have her?" Jordan pressed. "You're both miserable pretending—"

"Because my parents are already on high alert. Because Becca deserves better than me breaking up with her for my childhood friend who makes me question everything. Because Sophie needs to be able to have a normal life here without me making it a mess." Ethan's voice dropped. "And because if I'm being honest, I'm scared."

"Of what?"

"Of choosing wrong. Of disappointing everyone. Of wanting something I'm not supposed to want and ruining everything in the process."

Silence. Then Jordan said quietly, "So what are you going to do?"

"The right thing." Ethan sounded resolved. "I'm going to stay with Becca, be a good boyfriend, and help Sophie meet other people. Actually, I'm thinking of setting her up with someone. Alex Chen maybe? He's pre-med, smart, nice—"

Sophia didn't hear the rest. She was backing away, blood rushing in her ears, fighting to keep her breathing quiet.

Setting her up with someone. He was going to set her up with someone because that was the right thing to do. Because she was the problem he needed to solve, the variable he needed to manage out of his equation.

She made it to the bathroom before the first tears fell, locking herself in a stall and pressing her fist against her mouth to keep the sound in.

*I'm thinking of setting her up with someone.*

That's what she was to him. A problem requiring a solution. A distraction requiring management. Not someone he had feelings for—despite what he'd said to Jordan—but someone he needed to neutralize so he could focus on his real life.

Her phone buzzed.

**maya:** *where are you*

**maya:** *you missed the bell*

Sophia wiped her eyes, took three shaky breaths, and texted back: *bathroom*

*be there in a minute*

She stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror—red eyes, blotchy cheeks, the look of someone who'd just had her heart casually ripped out in a hallway. She splashed cold water on her face, but it didn't help. She still looked wrecked.

*Setting her up with someone.*

The words kept echoing. He'd said it so casually, like it was the obvious solution. Like she was a problem to be managed. A distraction to be neutralized. Not someone he cared about—not really. Just an inconvenience in his carefully planned life.

She couldn't fall apart. She had European History in five minutes, then badminton practice, and a tournament this weekend that required focus. She could cry later. She could process later.

Right now, she needed to put on her "I'm fine" face and get through the day.

---

European History was torture.

Sophia sat in the back row, staring at her notebook without seeing it. Mr. Thompson was lecturing about the Congress of Vienna, something about balance of power and diplomatic marriages, and normally she'd be taking notes. Normally she'd care.

But all she could think about was Ethan's voice: *I'm thinking of setting her up with someone. Alex Chen maybe?*

Alex Chen. She knew him vaguely—pre-med track, quiet, nice enough. Exactly the kind of person who made sense for her. Someone appropriate. Someone who wouldn't complicate Ethan's life.

Her phone buzzed silently in her pocket. Probably Maya, checking on her. Sophia didn't look.

At lunch, she couldn't face the cafeteria. Couldn't face seeing Ethan with Becca, couldn't face pretending everything was fine. She hid in the library instead, at a back table behind the stacks, and tried to eat her sandwich. It tasted like cardboard.

Maya found her anyway.

"Hey," Maya said, sliding into the seat across from her. "I've been texting you."

"Sorry. Phone's on silent."

"Sophie." Maya's voice was gentle. "What happened? You disappeared after second period looking like—" She stopped, studying Sophia's face. "Oh god. What did he do?"

"Nothing. He didn't do anything." Sophia set down her sandwich, appetite gone. "I just— I overheard him talking to Jordan. About me. About setting me up with someone so he can focus on Becca and hockey and his perfect life."

Maya's expression went from concerned to furious. "He what?"

"It's fine. He's doing the right thing. The responsible thing." Sophia's voice cracked slightly. "I'm the distraction, Maya. He's just managing the situation."

"That's not—" Maya stopped, took a breath. "Okay. First of all, you are not a distraction. You're a person with feelings who he clearly has feelings for. Second, if he's too much of a coward to deal with that honestly, that's on him. Not you."

"But I understand why he can't—"

"Stop," Maya interrupted firmly. "Stop making excuses for him. Stop understanding. He hurt you. You're allowed to be hurt."

Was she? Sophia stared at her hands—the same hands Ethan had held across a study table just yesterday. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he'd laced their fingers together and thanked her for seeing him. And now he was planning to set her up with someone else so she'd stop being a problem.

"I have badminton practice after school," Sophia said numbly. "I need to focus on that. The tournament's Saturday."

"Okay. But we're talking about this later. Real talk. Not you pretending you're fine." Maya squeezed her hand. "You're allowed to not be fine, Sophie."

Sophia nodded, but she knew she wouldn't talk about it later. She'd keep being fine, keep smiling, keep pretending her heart wasn't shattered. Because that's what you did when you were the thing someone needed to solve.

---

The rest of Wednesday afternoon dragged. In AP Calc, she kept her head down, avoided eye contact with Ethan across the room. She felt him looking at her—felt it like a physical thing—but she didn't look back. Couldn't.

After class, as she was gathering her books, he appeared beside her desk.

"Hey," he said. "You okay? You seemed off today."

Off. She was off. Like a light switch. Like something that needed adjusting.

"I'm fine," Sophia said, shouldering her backpack. "Just tired."

"Sophie—"

"I have to go. Badminton practice." She was moving before he could say more, before she could see whatever expression was on his face, before she could do something humiliating like cry in the hallway.

She felt him watching her leave, but she didn't turn around.

---

By Friday, Sophia had perfected the art of smiling while dying inside.

She smiled through AP Calc (they both aced the test). Smiled through lunch when Ethan joined their table and made everyone laugh. Smiled through badminton practice even though Coach Patterson kept asking if she was okay, she seemed off.

"Tournament tomorrow," Coach said after practice, pulling Sophia aside. "You're my top singles player. I need you sharp, focused, present. Whatever's going on in your life, set it aside for one day. Can you do that?"

"Yes, Coach."

"Good. Get some sleep tonight. Hydrate. Visualize winning." Coach squeezed her shoulder. "You've got this, Chen. I wouldn't have put you on varsity if I didn't believe in you."

Sophia nodded, grabbed her bag, and headed for the parking lot. The October evening was cold and clear, stars beginning to emerge. She should go home, eat dinner, study, sleep. Do all the responsible things.

Instead, she sat in her car and stared at her phone.

The group chat—the hockey team plus friends, which now included her—was full of messages about a party Saturday night. Tyler's house, parents out of town, low-key hangout post-game and post-tournament.

**tyler:** *everyone better show up*

**tyler:** *im making my famous nachos*

**jordan:** *your nachos are not famous*

**jordan:** *theyre barely edible*

**tyler:** *lies and slander*

**becca:** *well be there! sounds fun*

**maya:** *me and sophie are in*

**maya:** *assuming we dont die from badminton exhaustion*

Then a private message popped up, separate from the group chat. From Ethan.

**ethan:** *can we talk before the party?*

**ethan:** *theres something i want to ask you about*

Sophia stared at the message, stomach sinking. This was it. This was him setting her up with Alex Chen or whoever he'd decided was appropriate for her. This was him managing the situation, doing the right thing, solving the problem of her feelings.

She should say no. She should protect herself, create distance, stop walking into situations that would hurt.

But her thumbs were already typing: *sure*

Three dots appeared immediately.

**ethan:** *meet at the forks around 5?*

**ethan:** *before we head to tylers?*

**sophia:** *okay*

**ethan:** *great*

**ethan:** *see you tomorrow*

**ethan:** *good luck at your tournament*

Sophia locked her phone and dropped it in the passenger seat. Then she sat in the dark parking lot and let herself feel everything she'd been holding back all week.

He was going to tell her about someone he wanted her to date. Some nice, appropriate boy who made sense in the equations of their lives. And she was going to smile and thank him and pretend it didn't feel like her heart was being fed through a shredder.

Because that's what friends did. That's what you did when you were the complication someone needed to manage.

A knock on her window made her jump. Maya was standing outside, concern written across her face.

Sophia rolled down the window. "Hey."

"I saw your car still here." Maya tilted her head, studying her. "You okay?"

"Not really."

"Want to talk about it?"

Did she? Sophia looked at Maya—her friend, her teammate, the person who'd adopted her three weeks ago and refused to let her suffer alone—and felt something break loose.

"He's going to set me up with someone," she said, voice cracking. "I overheard him talking to Jordan. He has feelings for me but he's doing the 'right thing,' which apparently means setting me up with Alex Chen or someone equally appropriate so he can stay with Becca and I can stop being a problem."

Maya's expression went from concerned to furious in about two seconds. "Are you kidding me?"

"Nope. He wants to talk tomorrow before the party. About something he wants to ask me. Which obviously means—"

"Which means he's an idiot." Maya pulled open the car door. "Move over. We're sitting here until you process this like a normal human instead of whatever self-destructive thing you're planning to do."

Sophia moved over. Maya climbed into the driver's seat, shut the door, and turned to face her.

"Okay. Real talk. Do you have feelings for him?"

"Yes," Sophia whispered. "Everything. All at once. I can't stop."

"And he has feelings for you."

"But he's with Becca. And his parents hate me. And I'm the distraction that's messing up his focus." Sophia's eyes were burning. "I'm the variable that doesn't fit the equation, Maya. And he's trying to solve for a future that doesn't include me screwing everything up."

"Sophie. Babe." Maya grabbed her hands. "You are not the problem here. You are a brilliant, amazing person who makes him remember who he actually is under all the performance. If his parents can't see that, if he's too scared to choose what he actually wants, that's on them. Not you."

"But I understand why he's scared. I get it. There's so much at stake—his hockey future, his family expectations, everything. How can I ask him to risk that for me?"

"You're not asking. That's the problem." Maya squeezed her hands. "You're just existing, being yourself, and he's the one who can't handle it. That's not fair to you."

Sophia knew Maya was right. But knowing didn't make it hurt less.

"Tomorrow," Maya said firmly, "you're going to kill it at your tournament. You're going to play angry and win every match. Then you're going to meet him at The Forks, listen to whatever he has to say, and decide what YOU want. Not what's convenient for him, not what his parents approve of, but what you actually want."

"What if what I want isn't possible?"

"Then at least you'll know. And you can start moving on instead of being stuck in this limbo." Maya pulled her into a hug. "But Sophie? I don't think it's impossible. I think he's just scared. And maybe if you tell him how you actually feel—"

"I can't." Sophia pulled back, wiping her eyes. "He's with Becca. I can't be the girl who confesses feelings to someone else's boyfriend. That's not who I am."

"So you're just going to let him set you up with Alex Chen?"

"I'm going to smile and thank him and pretend I'm fine." Sophia's voice was steady now, resolved. "Because that's what friends do. And if friendship is all he can offer, I'll take it. Because having him in my life as a friend is better than not having him at all."

Maya looked like she wanted to argue, but finally just hugged her again. "You're stronger than me. I'd have set his hockey equipment on fire by now."

Despite everything, Sophia laughed. "That's why you're my friend. Emotional support and arson backup."

"Always." Maya climbed out of the car, then leaned back in through the window. "Tournament tomorrow. Focus on that. Everything else can wait until after you've crushed every opponent and reminded yourself how amazing you are."

"Thanks, Maya."

"Anytime. Now go home, eat something, sleep. You've got this."

Sophia drove home on autopilot, her mind already shifting toward tomorrow. Badminton first. Win matches, make Coach proud, prove to herself that she was good at something she could control.

Then the conversation with Ethan. Whatever he wanted to ask her about—whoever he wanted to set her up with—she'd handle it with grace.

She'd smile. She'd thank him. She'd pretend her heart wasn't breaking.

She'd become an expert at it.

---

Saturday morning arrived with brutal clarity: tournament day.

Sophia woke up at six, did her visualization exercises like Coach taught her, ate a protein-heavy breakfast, and carefully did not think about Ethan Price.

The tournament was at a community center across town, hosted by one of the other high schools in their division. Twelve schools competing, singles and doubles matches, running from nine AM until roughly forever.

Maya picked her up at seven-thirty, blasting pump-up music and radiating competitive energy.

"You ready to destroy people?" Maya asked as Sophia climbed in.

"So ready."

"Good. Because I have money riding on you making the finals." At Sophia's look, Maya grinned. "Kidding. Mostly. But seriously, you're going to kill it today."

They arrived to organized chaos: teams warming up, coaches checking rosters, the distinctive *thwack* of shuttlecocks being hit in warm-up courts. Sophia found her zone quickly—that focused headspace where nothing existed except the court, the birdie, and winning.

Her first match was a warm-up against a sophomore from another school. Sophia won 21-10, 21-8, barely breaking a sweat.

Second match was harder—a senior with a vicious serve and good court coverage. But Sophia's smashes were on fire today, powered by a week of repressed feelings, and she won 21-17, 21-15.

By lunch break, she'd won three matches and was seeded into the afternoon semifinals.

"You're playing angry," Coach Patterson observed, handing her a water bottle. "It's effective. But are you okay?"

"Fine," Sophia lied. "Just focused."

"Well, keep that focus for the semis. You're facing Jennifer Huang from St. Paul's. She placed third in provincials last year."

Sophia had seen Jennifer play that morning—tall, powerful, smart strategy. This would be a real match.

Good. She needed a real match. She needed something to pour all this feeling into that wasn't Ethan Price and his careful distance and his plan to set her up with someone appropriate.

The semifinal match started at two PM. Sophia and Jennifer were evenly matched—long rallies, strategic shots, both of them refusing to give an inch. The first game went to deuce, Sophia finally winning 24-22. The second game was brutal—Jennifer adjusted her strategy, targeted Sophia's backhand, won 21-18.

Third game, winner take all.

Sophia served. Jennifer returned. They fell into a rhythm—drop shot, clear, smash, defense. The score climbed: 10-10, 15-15, 18-18.

At 19-19, Jennifer hit a shot that was probably out. Probably. The line judge called it in.

Sophia gritted her teeth and kept playing. Not the time to argue. Focus.

20-19, Jennifer's lead. Match point.

Jennifer served—long, high. Sophia returned with a cross-court shot. Jennifer smashed. Sophia dove, got under it, sent it back high. Jennifer positioned for another smash but Sophia anticipated, moved forward, caught it at the net with a perfect drop shot that Jennifer couldn't reach.

20-20.

Sophia's serve now. She took a breath, visualized the shot, served deep to Jennifer's backhand. The rally went eight shots—both of them exhausted, both refusing to lose—and then Sophia saw her opening. Jennifer was slightly off-balance, favoring her forehand side. Sophia smashed cross-court to the open space.

21-20.

One more point. She could do this.

She served again, Jennifer returned aggressive, and they went into the longest rally of the match. Sophia's lungs were burning, her whole body trembling, but she wouldn't lose. Couldn't lose. This was what she controlled. This was where she got to win.

Finally, Jennifer's shot went wide by inches. Out.

"Point," the line judge called. "Match."

Sophia had won.

She shook Jennifer's hand, accepted Coach Patterson's proud hug, and made it to the bathroom before she started shaking for real.

She'd won. She was going to the finals. She was good at something, excellent at something, something that had nothing to do with Ethan Price and impossible feelings.

Her phone buzzed. Multiple texts.

**maya:** *THAT WAS AMAZING*

**maya:** *YOURE A WARRIOR*

**priya:** *holy shit sophie youre in the finals!!!*

**Coach Patterson (group text to team):** *chen advances to finals. 4 pm. everyone better be there to cheer.*

And then, from Ethan: *maya posted on her story*

*i saw your match*

*you were incredible*

*good luck in the finals*

Sophia stared at that message, emotions warring in her chest. He was watching. Somehow, even from wherever he was, he was paying attention.

She didn't respond. She splashed cold water on her face, went back out, and prepared for the finals.

---

The finals match was at four PM against a girl from Lord Selkirk High who was apparently being recruited for university programs. She was that good.

Sophia lost the first game 21-14. Won the second 21-18. The third game went to 23-21, and Sophia lost.

Second place. Silver medal. Outstanding performance for a junior in her first varsity tournament.

But Sophia felt like she'd lost more than just the match.

She accepted her medal, smiled for photos, listened to Coach Patterson's praise about what an achievement this was. Inside, she felt hollow.

"You played amazing," Maya said, hugging her fiercely. "Seriously. That girl's a senior being recruited by universities and you almost beat her."

"Almost."

"Almost is still incredible for your first tournament." Maya pulled back, studying her face. "This isn't about badminton, is it?"

"No," Sophia admitted quietly. "It's not."

"Then let's get you to that conversation with Ethan. Get it over with. Rip off the bandaid."

Right. The conversation. Where he was going to set her up with someone and she was going to smile and pretend to be fine.

Sophia changed out of her athletic clothes, got into Maya's car, and checked her phone. Five-fifteen. She was supposed to meet Ethan at The Forks at five.

**ethan:** *running a few minutes late*

**ethan:** *coach wanted to talk after the game*

**ethan:** *meet you at our spot by the river at 5:30?*

Their spot. The bench he'd shown her that first day at The Forks, his quiet place.

**sophia:** *okay*

Maya drove her to The Forks, giving her hand one last squeeze before she got out. "You're amazing and brilliant and if he can't see that, it's his loss. Remember that."

"Thanks."

"Text me after. I'll be at Tyler's setting up for the party. You're still coming, right?"

"Yeah. I'll be there."

Sophia walked through The Forks market—quieter on a Saturday evening, tourists thinning out—toward the path that led to Ethan's bench. The October sun was setting, painting everything gold and orange, and she tried to memorize this moment. Before. Whatever came next, this was the before.

Ethan was already there, sitting on the bench, staring at the river. He looked up when he heard her footsteps, and his smile was full of things he wasn't saying.

"Hey," he said, standing. "You made it."

"Yeah." Sophia sat down, leaving space between them. "What did you want to talk about?"

This was it. The moment where he set her up with someone appropriate and she pretended her heart wasn't splintering.

But Ethan didn't sit down. He stayed standing, running a hand through his hair—nervous gesture, childhood tell.

"I need to ask you something," he said. "And I need— you need to be honest with me. Okay?"

"Okay..."

"Do you—" He laughed, frustrated with himself. "These past few weeks. Being around you again. It's been..." Another rough laugh. "God, Sophie, it's been the best part of— of moving back to Winnipeg. Coming back here. You make me feel like myself again. Like the person I was before everything got so..." He gestured vaguely, couldn't find the word.

Sophia's heart was going wild. This wasn't the speech she'd expected.

"And I know— I know I'm with Becca. I know my parents have opinions. I know this is all super messed up." He was pacing now, words coming faster. "But I need to know if I'm— if I'm imagining this. If it's just me who's feeling—" He cut himself off with a noise of frustration. "I don't know how to ask this."

He stopped pacing. Looked at her directly. "Do you feel it too? This— whatever this is. Between us. Do you feel it?"

The world condensed to this moment: Ethan Price, asking the question she'd been too scared to ask. Offering her a chance to be honest instead of safe.

Sophia opened her mouth to answer—to say yes, I feel it, I've felt it since the moment I saw you again—when her phone exploded with notifications.

Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz.

Group chat going crazy. Multiple messages from Maya, from Jordan, from numbers she didn't recognize.

"Sorry," she said, pulling out her phone to silence it. But she saw the preview of Maya's message: *DONT GO TO THE PARTY. BECCA KNOWS. EMMAS COUSIN TOLD HER ABOUT—*

"What's wrong?" Ethan asked, reading her expression.

Sophia looked up from her phone to find him watching her, and all the words she'd been about to say evaporated.

Becca knew. About what? About them? About the hand-holding, the library sessions, the way Ethan had pointed at her after scoring?

"I have to go," Sophia said, standing abruptly.

"What? Sophie, wait—"

"I'm sorry. I just—" She was backing away, phone buzzing again with more messages. "I have to go. I'm sorry."

"Sophie!" Ethan called after her, but she was already running, back through The Forks, toward the parking lot where Maya said she'd wait.

Her phone wouldn't stop buzzing. More messages, different people:

**jordan:** *heads up*

**jordan:** *becca confronted ethan about you after the game*

**jordan:** *it got messy*

**tyler:** *party might be cancelled*

**tyler:** *drama incoming*

**maya:** *where are you*

**maya:** *are you with him?*

**maya:** *call me*

And then, from an unknown number:

**unknown:** *this is becca*

**unknown:** *we need to talk*

**unknown:** *about you and ethan*

**unknown:** *im not angry*

**unknown:** *i just want to understand whats happening*

**unknown:** *can you call me?*

Sophia stopped in the middle of the parking lot, staring at her phone, the sunset painting everything the color of ending.

She'd been so focused on protecting herself, on being appropriate, on not causing problems. But the problems had found her anyway.

And Ethan—Ethan had been about to ask her something. Had been about to be honest about what was between them. And she'd run.

Her phone buzzed again. Private message from Ethan:

**ethan:** *i need to talk to you*

**ethan:** *not about setting you up with someone*

**ethan:** *i was never going to do that*

**ethan:** *jordan misunderstood*

**ethan:** *i was going to ask if you felt the same way i feel*

**ethan:** *because sophie*

**ethan:** *im falling for you*

**ethan:** *and i need to know if im doing this alone*

Sophia stared at that message, the words blurring through sudden tears.

*im falling for you*

He'd said it. Actually said it. And she'd run.

She started typing a response—*i feel the same way, ive felt the same way since i saw you again, im falling for you too*—when Maya's car screeched into the parking lot.

"Get in," Maya yelled through the window. "Everything's exploding and we need to figure out what to do."

Sophia got in, phone still in her hand, Ethan's message still unanswered. Behind her, the bench by the river sat empty, and somewhere Ethan was waiting for a response that would change everything.

"What happened?" Sophia asked as Maya drove.

"Emma's cousin told Becca about Saturday—about him pointing at you after the goal, about the way you were sitting together at Stella's. Becca confronted him after his game today. He tried to explain and it went badly." Maya glanced at her. "She broke up with him, Sophie. Told him to figure out what he actually wants before dragging her along for it."

It hit Sophia somewhere behind her collarbone—that oh shit feeling. "He got dumped because of me."

"He got dumped because he was emotionally cheating with you while dating her. That's on him, not you." Maya's voice was firm. "But now the question is: what do you want to do about it?"

Sophia looked at her phone. Ethan's message: *im falling for you. and i need to know if im doing this alone*

She started typing, fingers unsteady: *youre not alone*

*i feel it too*

*im sorry i ran*

*im sorry for all of this*

*but i—*

Before she could finish, another message came through from Ethan: *my parents just called*

*they saw what happened with becca*

*they want me home now for a "family discussion"*

*pretty sure that means theyre going to tell me to stop seeing you*

Then: *i dont know what happens next*

*but i need you to know*

*whatever happens*

*you werent the distraction*

*you were the reminder*

*of who im supposed to be*

*who i want to be*

Another message: *i have to go deal with my parents*

*but can we talk?*

*tomorrow?*

*actually talk this time?*

Sophia typed back: *yes*

*tomorrow*

*im sorry about becca*

*im sorry about all of it*

**ethan:** *dont be sorry*

**ethan:** *nothing about you is something to be sorry for*

Then: *talk tomorrow*

*i promise*

Sophia locked her phone and stared out the window as Maya drove. The sun was setting over Winnipeg, painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson, and everything was falling apart and coming together at the same time.

He was falling for her. His girlfriend had broken up with him. His parents were probably going to try to manage the situation. And tomorrow they were going to talk—really talk—about what this thing between them actually was.

"So," Maya said quietly. "What now?"

Sophia didn't have an answer. She just sat in the passenger seat, watching the city blur past, and tried to figure out how her life had gone from carefully controlled to absolutely chaotic in the span of four weeks.

Her phone buzzed one more time. Private message from Ethan:

**ethan:** *for the record?*

**ethan:** *i was never going to set you up with alex chen*

**ethan:** *i was going to ask if you wanted to go to homecoming*

**ethan:** *with me*

**ethan:** *as more than friends*

Sophia stared at that message, and something in her chest broke open—not painful, but like sunlight through clouds.

*with me. as more than friends*

She typed back: *ask me tomorrow*

*when everything isnt exploding*

**ethan:** *tomorrow*

**ethan:** *i promise*

Maya glanced over. "You okay?"

"I have no idea," Sophia said honestly. "Everything's a disaster. His parents probably hate me. Becca's hurt. Everyone at school is going to have opinions. But Maya?"

"Yeah?"

"He's falling for me." Sophia couldn't help the smile that broke through despite everything. "He's actually falling for me."

"I know. I could have told you that weeks ago." Maya grinned. "So what are you going to do about it?"

"Tomorrow," Sophia said, echoing Ethan's promise. "Tomorrow I'm going to actually talk to him. Be honest about what I feel instead of hiding. And then..." She took a breath. "Then I guess we figure out if we can make this work despite everything trying to stop us."

"That's my girl." Maya cranked up the music. "Now, do we go to this party and face the drama, or do we go consume ice cream and plan your next move?"

Sophia thought about it—the party full of people with opinions, questions, judgments. Ethan wouldn't be there; he was dealing with his parents. Becca might be there, hurt and confused. Everyone would want to know what happened.

"Ice cream," Sophia decided. "Definitely ice cream."

"Best decision you've made all day."

As they drove through Winnipeg, Sophia pulled up her text thread with Ethan and read his messages again:

*im falling for you*

*you werent the distraction. you were the reminder*

*i was going to ask if you wanted to go to homecoming with me. as more than friends*

Tomorrow, she'd tell him yes. To all of it. Yes to being more than friends. Yes to homecoming. Yes to figuring out how to make this work despite his parents' plans and her own fears and the complicated mess of their lives.

Tomorrow, she'd stop being the variable that didn't fit and start being the equation's solution.

But tonight—tonight she was going to eat ice cream with her best friend and try to process the fact that Ethan Price was falling for her, and everything was about to change.

Her phone buzzed one last time. Another message from Ethan:

**ethan:** *sleep well soph*

**ethan:** *tomorrow everythings going to be different*

**ethan:** *better*

**ethan:** *i promise*

Sophia smiled at her phone, at the nickname only he used, at the promise in those words.

She typed back: *better*

*i like the sound of that*

Then she locked her phone, leaned back in her seat, and let herself feel everything—the fear, the hope, the cautious joy of maybe, possibly, this could actually work.

Tomorrow they'd talk. Tomorrow they'd figure it out.

Tomorrow everything would be different.

## Episode 2 Summary:
Sophia integrates into Ethan's world while battling her feelings. Group hangouts, study sessions, and his second hockey game deepen their connection despite boundaries. His parents evaluate her over dinner, measuring if she's appropriate or problematic. At Stella's Diner after his game, they sit too close, feel too much, pretend too little. When Sophia overhears him talking about "setting her up with someone," she spirals—but he was actually planning to ask her to homecoming. Her badminton tournament success is overshadowed by emotional chaos. At The Forks, Ethan almost confesses his feelings when everything explodes: Becca knows, breaks up with him, and his parents call for a "discussion." The episode ends with Ethan's text: *I'm falling for you. And I need to know if I'm doing this alone.* Sophie's response: *You're not alone.* Tomorrow, they talk. Tomorrow, everything changes.
