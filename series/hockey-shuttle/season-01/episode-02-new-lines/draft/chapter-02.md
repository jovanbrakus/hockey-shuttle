# Chapter 2: Study Partners

The Millennium Library downtown was Sophia's new favorite place in Winnipeg.

Not the school library—that was too small, too full of people who knew her or wanted to know her or were analyzing her friendship with Ethan Hayes like it was a social experiment. No, the downtown library was perfect: huge and anonymous, with study rooms and quiet corners and the kind of focused silence that made thinking possible.

Plus, it was neutral territory. Not Ethan's world or hers, just a shared space where they could be two students working on calculus without everyone having opinions about it.

She'd been coming here every Tuesday and Thursday after badminton practice for the past week, usually alone. Getting ahead on homework, reviewing for tests, finding the kind of rhythm she'd had in Thunder Bay before everything got complicated.

But today—Wednesday afternoon, grey and drizzly—her phone buzzed as she was settling into her usual corner desk on the third floor.

**Ethan:** *Test Friday?*

**Sophia:** *Yeah, derivatives and chain rule*

**Ethan:** *I'm dead. Jordan's no help. He just keeps making jokes about deriving meaning from life*

**Sophia:** *That's actually pretty good*

**Ethan:** *Don't encourage him. Study session? I can meet wherever*

She should say no. She'd just spent Monday's lunch period tutoring him through the homework, and Maya's voice was still echoing in her head: *Just friends. Sure, Sophie.*

But her thumbs were already typing: *Millennium Library, third floor, northeast corner. I'm here now.*

**Ethan:** *On my way*

Sophia stared at her phone, heart doing something arhythmic. This was fine. Friends studied together. It didn't mean anything.

She was definitely lying to herself again.

---

Ethan arrived twenty minutes later, hair damp from the rain, backpack slung over one shoulder. He was wearing his Westwood Hockey hoodie and jeans that probably cost more than Sophia's entire outfit, but he moved through the library like he belonged in this space too—easy, confident, drawing eyes without seeming to notice.

"Hey," he said quietly, dropping into the chair across from her. The study desk was small, intimate, their knees almost touching underneath. "Thanks for this. I know you're busy with your tournament coming up."

"Two weeks," Sophia said, pulling out her calc textbook. "And I'm never too busy to mock your mathematical struggles."

"Wow. Brutal." But he was smiling, unpacking his own books. "This is why we're friends, Soph. You keep me humble."

Friends. There was that word again, a safety rail they both kept grabbing onto.

"Okay," Sophia said, focusing on the textbook instead of the way the afternoon light caught in his hair. "Show me where you're stuck."

For the next hour, they worked through problems with the kind of focus Sophia remembered from childhood—both of them competitive, both determined to understand not just the how but the why. Ethan was smart, she'd forgotten how smart. His parents had pushed him so hard into hockey that it was easy to miss the fact that he actually loved learning.

"Wait," he said, halfway through a particularly nasty chain rule problem. "So you're saying the derivative of the outside function, times the derivative of the inside function, times—no, that's not right."

"You're close." Sophia pulled the textbook toward her, their hands brushing. She ignored the small electric shock of contact. "Think of it like nested equations. You work from the outside in, taking derivatives at each layer."

"Like peeling an onion."

"Exactly. Except calculus makes you cry less than onions."

"Debatable," Ethan muttered, but he was working through the problem now, his handwriting careful and precise. When he got it right—the answer matching the back of the book—he looked up with such pure triumph that Sophia couldn't help laughing.

"See? You don't need me."

"I definitely need you." He said it without thinking, then seemed to realize what he'd said. "For calc. I definitely need you for calc."

"Right. Obviously." Sophia looked down at her own homework, heat creeping up her neck. "That's what I meant."

The silence that followed was complicated, full of things neither of them was saying. Outside the windows, Winnipeg was turning gray and gold in the late afternoon—that particular October light that made everything look like memory.

"So," Ethan said finally, breaking the tension. "My parents' dinner on Friday. You're still coming, right?"

Sophia had been trying not to think about that. Meeting Robert and Caroline Hayes felt like walking into an evaluation, which is exactly what Ethan said it was.

"If you want me to."

"I do." He leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair—a gesture she remembered from childhood, his tell when he was nervous. "Fair warning though: my dad's going to ask about your academic plans. Your GPA. Where you're applying for college. He's going to assess whether you're 'appropriately ambitious.'"

"Appropriately ambitious," Sophia repeated slowly. "What does that even mean?"

"It means ambitious enough that you won't distract me, but not so ambitious that you'll compete with me for the same opportunities." Ethan's expression was tight. "It's how they evaluate everyone in my life. Becca passed because she's focused on business school, completely different track from mine. Jordan passed because he's planning film school. Tyler barely passed because he's another hockey player, which my dad sees as potential competition."

"That's..." Sophia searched for a word that captured how messed up that was. "Intense."

"That's my life." He said it matter-of-factly, without self-pity, which somehow made it worse. "They mean well. They just have this very specific vision of my future, and they're terrified anything that doesn't fit the vision will derail me."

"And I don't fit the vision."

"You complicate the vision." Ethan leaned forward, elbows on the desk, close enough that she could see the small scar through his eyebrow again. "You make me want things I set aside years ago. MIT. Engineering. A life that's mine instead of theirs."

This was dangerous territory, the same conversation they'd had at The Forks but more pointed, more raw. Sophia's heart was doing that arhythmic thing again.

"What do you want?" she asked quietly. "Really?"

Ethan looked at her for a long moment, and she watched him weigh honesty against safety. Finally, he said, "I want to play hockey because I love it, not because it's the plan. I want to study engineering because it makes my brain light up the way it did when we were kids competing in math competitions. And I want—"

He stopped. Pulled back. The shutters came down.

"What?" Sophia pressed. "You want what?"

"To not disappoint anyone," he finished, but she could tell that wasn't what he'd been about to say. "My parents, my coaches, the scouts who are already watching. I want to be who everyone needs me to be."

"That's not the same as being who you are."

"Maybe who I am isn't good enough."

The words landed like stones in still water. Sophia stared at him—Ethan Hayes, star center, straight-A student, objectively perfect in every measurable way—and saw the nine-year-old kid who'd cried because his parents were making him move away from everything he knew.

"You're wrong," she said fiercely. "Who you are is—you're not giving yourself enough credit."

"Says the girl who's known me the longest." He smiled, but it was sad. "You're biased, Soph."

"I'm right." She reached across the table without thinking, covering his hand with hers. "I've always been right about you."

They both froze, staring at her hand on his. This was too much, too intimate, too honest. Friends didn't hold hands across study tables while having conversations about identity and disappointed expectations.

Sophia started to pull away, but Ethan turned his hand over, lacing his fingers through hers. His palm was warm and calloused from hockey sticks and weight training.

"Thanks," he said quietly. "For seeing me. Not just the performance."

"Always," Sophia said, and meant it more than she'd meant anything in her life.

They sat like that for a moment—hands linked, the library quiet around them, something huge and unspoken taking up all the air in the room. Sophia could feel her pulse in her throat. This was crossing lines. This was definitely crossing lines.

Then Ethan's phone buzzed, shattering the moment. He pulled his hand away to check it, and Sophia felt the loss like cold air on skin.

"Becca," he said, typing a response. "She wants to know if I'm still coming over after this."

Right. Becca. His girlfriend. Who existed and was lovely and hadn't done anything wrong except date someone who was holding another girl's hand in a library.

"You should go," Sophia said, gathering her books with hands that shook slightly. "I have badminton practice anyway."

"Sophie—"

"It's fine." She stood up quickly, before she could do something stupid like cry or ask what that hand-holding had meant or beg him to stay. "Thanks for studying with me. You'll ace the test."

"Wait." Ethan stood too, catching her arm gently. "Friday. My parents' dinner. Six PM. I'll text you the address."

"Okay."

"And Sophie?" He was still holding her arm, his grip warm through her sleeve. "Thank you. For this. For understanding."

Understanding what? That he was conflicted? That she was the complication in his neat life plan? That friends sometimes held hands and it didn't mean anything?

"Sure," she said, pulling away. "That's what friends are for."

She left before he could respond, hurrying down the library stairs and out into the grey October afternoon. The rain had stopped but everything was wet—streets, trees, the bench where she sat for a moment trying to get her breathing under control.

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan:** *I'm sorry. That was...*

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again. Finally: *I'll see you Friday.*

Sophia stared at the message, then typed and deleted five different responses before settling on: *See you Friday.*

She shoved her phone in her pocket and started walking toward the bus stop. Her car was in the school parking lot, a twenty-minute bus ride away, but she needed the time to think. To process. To stop feeling the ghost of his hand in hers.

Maya was right. This wasn't just friendship. This was something bigger and messier and more dangerous, and Sophia had no idea what to do about it except lie to herself and pretend her heart wasn't breaking in real-time.

---

Badminton practice was exactly what she needed—physical, demanding, leaving no room for overthinking.

Coach Patterson had them running suicide drills, then practicing serves for thirty minutes straight. By the time they moved to scrimmages, Sophia's mind was blissfully empty of everything except shuttlecocks and footwork and the satisfying *thwack* of a perfect smash.

She played against Maya first, winning two games to one, then against Priya, who had a vicious serve but struggled with net play. Sophia won both games, her competitive streak fully engaged.

"You're on fire today," Maya said during water break, watching Sophia with assessing eyes. "What happened?"

"Nothing. Just focused."

"Right. And I'm the Queen of England." Maya took a long drink from her water bottle. "Does this have anything to do with Ethan Hayes?"

"Why does everything have to be about Ethan?"

"Because you've been checking your phone every five minutes, you have that specific look you get when you're overthinking something, and you're playing angry." Maya paused. "Also because I'm your friend and I'm worried about you."

Sophia's throat tightened. Maya had known her all of three weeks but had somehow become the person she trusted most here. It was alarming how quickly that had happened.

"We studied together," Sophia said finally. "At the library. And it was... complicated."

"Complicated how?"

"Complicated like we held hands and he has a girlfriend complicated."

Maya's eyes widened. "Oh."

"Yeah. Oh." Sophia squeezed her water bottle too hard, nearly spraying herself. "It didn't mean anything. He was upset about his parents and I was trying to be supportive and it just happened."

"Sophie." Maya's voice was gentle. "You know it meant something."

"He has a girlfriend," Sophia repeated, like that was an answer.

"I know. And that sucks. But pretending you don't have feelings for him isn't going to make them go away." Maya hesitated, then added, "And I don't think you're the only one with feelings."

"Don't."

"I'm just saying—"

"Don't," Sophia said more firmly. "He's with Becca. He's happy with Becca. I'm the complication, the distraction, the variable that doesn't fit. And even if he wasn't with her, his parents would never approve. So it doesn't matter what I feel or what he feels or what any of this means."

"It matters to you," Maya said quietly.

That was the problem, wasn't it? It mattered desperately to Sophia, and it couldn't, because there was no future where this worked out. Best case scenario, she was his friend. Worst case, she was the girl who ruined his relationship and his focus and his carefully planned future.

"Back to drills," Coach Patterson called, saving Sophia from having to respond.

For the next hour, she threw herself into practice with single-minded intensity. Clear-drop-smash sequences. Net shots. Defense drills. Her muscles burned and her lungs ached and it felt good, like punishment and absolution all at once.

By the time practice ended, she was exhausted enough that thinking about Ethan felt less like emotional quicksand and more like a problem she could set aside for later.

"Better?" Maya asked as they headed to the locker room.

"Getting there."

"Good. Because we have a tournament in two weeks and I need you focused." Maya bumped her shoulder affectionately. "But also, for what it's worth? Whatever you're feeling is valid. Even if it's complicated."

Sophia managed a smile. "When did you become so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You're just now noticing."

They changed and headed out to the parking lot together. The evening was cool and clear, stars beginning to emerge over the city. Sophia's phone buzzed as she unlocked her car.

**Ethan:** *How was practice?*

Her heart did that stupid flutter thing. She typed carefully: *Good. Violent. Coach had us doing drills until we couldn't feel our legs.*

**Ethan:** *Ha. I know that feeling. We had suicide skates today. Pretty sure I left a lung on the ice.*

**Sophia:** *Maybe you'll find it before your game Saturday*

**Ethan:** *Are you coming? To the game?*

She should say no. She should create distance, protect herself, stop walking willingly into situations that would hurt.

But her thumbs typed: *Planning on it.*

**Ethan:** *Good. I play better when you're watching.*

Sophia stared at that message for a full minute, trying to decode it. What did that mean? Why did he play better? And why was he telling her that?

Before she could figure out how to respond, another message arrived: *Becca says hi btw. She's excited you're coming to more games.*

Oh. Right. Becca. Who was excited that her boyfriend's childhood friend was supporting him. Because she was a good person who had no idea her boyfriend held other girls' hands in libraries.

**Sophia:** *Tell her hi back. See you at school tomorrow.*

She drove home with the radio loud, trying to drown out the noise in her head. But Ethan's words kept echoing: *I play better when you're watching.*

And the worse truth underneath: she felt more herself when he was around too. Like the Sophia who'd existed in Thunder Bay—confident, smart, ambitious—could coexist with this new Sophia who didn't quite fit anywhere yet.

He made her feel possible. That was the problem. That was the whole entire problem.

---

Thursday passed in a blur of classes and homework and carefully avoiding Ethan in the hallways. She saw him at lunch, sitting with Becca and Tyler, but she ate with Maya and the badminton team and pretended she wasn't hyperaware of his location at all times.

In AP Calc, they had the test. Sophia finished early and spent the last ten minutes watching Ethan work three rows over. He was frowning in concentration, occasionally erasing and rewriting, and she could tell the exact moment he hit a chain rule problem. His shoulders tensed, then relaxed when he worked through it.

She'd helped him with that. She'd given him the tools to solve it.

When class ended, he caught up to her in the hallway.

"That was brutal," he said, falling into step beside her. "But I think I got them all. The chain rule ones especially."

"Good."

"Thanks to you." He bumped her shoulder with his, casual and easy. "Best study partner in the province."

"Just the province? I'm insulted."

"Okay, fine. Best study partner in Canada. Better?"

"Getting there."

They walked in comfortable silence toward the cafeteria. This was safe—this easy banter, this friendship without complications. Sophia could do this. She could be his friend and nothing more and eventually her heart would catch up with her brain.

"So tomorrow," Ethan said as they approached the cafeteria doors. "My parents' place. You're still good for six?"

"Still good."

"Great." He hesitated, then added, "And Sophie? Don't worry about impressing them. Just be yourself. That's enough."

But Sophia wasn't sure being herself was enough when herself was the variable that complicated his equation.

---

Friday arrived with cold clarity: first frost of the season, car windows iced over, her breath visible in the morning air.

Sophia spent the day in a state of low-level anxiety about the dinner. What did you wear to be evaluated by your childhood friend's ambitious parents? What did you say when they asked if you were a distraction or an appropriate influence?

By the time school ended, she'd changed outfits three times in the bathroom—settling finally on dark jeans and a nice sweater that said "I'm taking this seriously but not trying too hard"—and practiced small talk in the mirror like a lunatic.

Maya found her doing this and just shook her head. "You're meeting his parents, not interviewing for NASA."

"His parents basically *are* NASA," Sophia muttered. "They've got his whole life planned. I'm the anomaly in their data set."

"Then be the most impressive anomaly they've ever seen." Maya hugged her. "You're brilliant and driven and nice, which is a rare combination. If they can't see that, it's their loss."

Sophia hugged back, grateful. "When did you become my emotional support person?"

"When you showed up to Westwood looking lost and I decided you needed a friend." Maya pulled back, grinning. "Now go. Dazzle them with your brain. Report back tomorrow."

The Hayes family lived in Tuxedo, one of Winnipeg's wealthy neighborhoods, in a house that was somehow both modern and traditional—lots of windows, clean lines, perfectly landscaped yard even in October. Sophia parked her mom's Honda on the street, feeling suddenly inadequate in every possible way.

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan:** *You here?*

**Sophia:** *Parked outside having a small crisis*

**Ethan:** *Come inside. I'm having a bigger crisis and misery loves company*

Despite her nerves, Sophia smiled. She grabbed the wine her parents had insisted she bring (even though she tried to explain that showing up with wine when you're sixteen was probably weird), and headed up the walk.

Ethan opened the door before she could knock.

"Hey," he said, and the relief in his voice was palpable. "You came."

"You doubted me?"

"Little bit, yeah." He was wearing slacks and a button-down, looking uncomfortable and formal. "Fair warning: my dad's in full interview mode and my mom's made enough food for twelve people. It's going to be intense."

"Appropriately ambitious," Sophia reminded him. "I've got this."

"Right." Ethan's expression softened. "You do. You've always got this."

He stepped back to let her in, and Sophia entered the Hayes family home feeling like she was crossing a border into foreign territory. The house was beautiful—hardwood floors, modern furniture, family photos on the walls showing Ethan's progression from gap-toothed kid to hockey star. But it felt more like a showroom than a home, everything a little too perfect.

"Sophia!" Caroline Hayes emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She was tall and elegant, blonde hair pulled back, wearing casual clothes that somehow looked formal. "It's so wonderful to see you again! You've grown up so much!"

"Thank you for having me, Mrs. Hayes." Sophia held out the wine bottle awkwardly. "My parents sent this."

"How thoughtful! Tell Susan and James hello for us." Caroline took the bottle, examining the label with a practiced eye. Then she surprised Sophia by pulling her into a brief hug. "We're so glad you and Ethan reconnected. He's been talking about you nonstop."

"Mom," Ethan said, pained.

"What? You have." Caroline smiled at them both, and there was something assessing in her gaze. "Come, dinner's almost ready. Robert's in the living room."

Robert Hayes was exactly what Sophia remembered, just older: tall like Ethan, dark hair going gray at the temples, the kind of handshake that evaluated grip strength. He was wearing slacks and a polo shirt, business casual at home.

"Sophia Chen," he said, his voice warm but measuring. "I remember you from Thunder Bay. You and Ethan were quite the pair—always competing in those math competitions."

"He usually won," Sophia said, which was mostly true.

"She's being modest," Ethan cut in. "She beat me in the regional competition when we were eight."

"By two points," Sophia added.

"A win's a win." Robert gestured toward the couch. "Please, sit. Tell me about your plans. Ethan says you're interested in engineering?"

And there it was—the evaluation beginning. Sophia sat down, acutely aware of Ethan beside her, his parents across the coffee table, and launched into the speech she'd been mentally preparing all day.

"Yes, sir. Aerospace engineering specifically. My dad works at StandardAero, so I've been exposed to the field my whole life. I'm planning to apply to MIT, Caltech, Stanford—the top programs."

"Impressive." Robert leaned back, studying her. "MIT was Ethan's first choice too, before he committed to the hockey path. Different programs though—you're aerospace, he'd be mechanical."

"Actually," Ethan said quietly, "we'd probably end up in a lot of the same core classes. The engineering curriculum overlaps significantly."

His parents exchanged a look—quick, wordless communication that Sophia couldn't decode. Caroline's smile tightened fractionally.

"Well," she said brightly, "dinner should be ready. Shall we?"

The dining room was as perfect as the rest of the house—table set with cloth napkins, wine glasses (empty for the teenagers), serving dishes arranged precisely. Caroline had made roast chicken with vegetables and potatoes, everything beautifully presented.

As they ate, the conversation flowed through safe topics: badminton, Sophia's tournament, how she was adjusting to Westwood. But underneath, Sophia could feel the real evaluation happening. Robert asked careful questions about her academic achievements, her extracurriculars, her time management strategies. Caroline asked about her family, her values, what she wanted from life.

They were mapping her, Sophia realized. Trying to figure out if she fit into their vision for Ethan's future, or if she was the threat he'd warned her about.

"So," Robert said during a lull in conversation, "you and Ethan have been spending quite a bit of time together. Study sessions, correct?"

"Dad," Ethan said, a warning in his voice.

"I'm just asking." Robert's tone was mild. "It's wonderful that you have a friend who shares your academic interests. Becca is lovely, but she's more business-minded. Different strengths."

The implication was clear: Becca wasn't a threat to his academic focus because she operated in a different sphere. But Sophia—smart, ambitious, interested in the same fields—she was competition. Or distraction. Or both.

"Sophia's helping me remember why I liked math and science in the first place," Ethan said, his voice steady but tight. "That's not a bad thing."

"Of course not," Caroline interjected smoothly. "We're thrilled you're maintaining your academic performance. Coach Richards mentioned you've been even more focused lately."

Coach Richards. Right. Because they tracked everything—his grades, his practice attendance, his social connections. The Hayes family approach to parenting was data-driven and comprehensive.

"I just want to make sure," Robert continued, still looking at Sophia, "that everyone in Ethan's life understands what's at stake. NHL scouts are already watching. The next two years determine his entire future. Any distractions—"

"I'm not a distraction, Mr. Hayes." Sophia set down her fork, meeting his gaze directly. "Ethan and I push each other to be better. We always have. That's what friends do."

The room went quiet. Ethan was staring at her with something like awe. Caroline looked surprised. Robert's expression was unreadable.

Then, slowly, Robert smiled.

"You're right," he said. "That is what friends do." He paused. "Just so we're clear on what we're talking about. Friends."

The emphasis on the last word was pointed. This wasn't just about academics or distraction. This was about Becca, about boundaries, about making sure Sophia knew her place in Ethan's carefully planned life.

"Crystal clear," Sophia said, her voice calm even though her heart was hammering.

"Good." Robert returned to his chicken. "Now, tell me about this badminton tournament. Ethan says you're quite talented."

The rest of dinner passed in slightly less tense conversation. They talked about sports, about Winnipeg versus Thunder Bay, about college application timelines. Caroline served apple pie for dessert—homemade, perfect, of course—and by the time Sophia thanked them and headed for the door, she felt wrung out and exhausted.

Ethan walked her outside, hands shoved in his pockets against the cold.

"I'm sorry," he said as soon as the door closed behind them. "My dad was being—"

"Protective," Sophia finished. "I get it. He wants what's best for you."

"No, he wants what he thinks is best for me. There's a difference." Ethan stopped at her car, looking miserable. "You handled it perfectly though. The whole 'that's what friends do' thing? He respected that."

Friends. That word again, a box they were both trapped in.

"Well," Sophia said, unlocking her car, "that's what we are, right? Friends."

"Right." Ethan's jaw tightened. "Friends."

They stood there in the cold October night, and Sophia thought about all the things she wanted to say: *I hate that word. I hate that I can't tell you how I feel. I hate that your parents look at me like I'm a threat when all I want is for you to be happy.*

Instead, she said, "See you at the game tomorrow?"

"Yeah." Ethan's expression shifted, something warm breaking through. "Yeah. I'll play better knowing you're there."

There it was again—that echo from his text, loaded with meaning she couldn't quite decipher. Sophia got in her car before she could do something stupid, and drove home with her hands shaking slightly on the wheel.

Her phone buzzed at a red light.

**Ethan:** *Thanks for surviving that. You were amazing. My parents are already discussing how "appropriate" you are. I think you passed.*

**Sophia:** *Yay me. Do I get a certificate?*

**Ethan:** *Better. You get my eternal gratitude and first pick of study spot next week.*

**Sophia:** *Living the dream*

**Ethan:** *Seriously though. Thank you. For being you. For not running away. For still being my friend after experiencing the Hayes family evaluation process.*

Friend. Sophia stared at that word until the car behind her honked.

**Sophia:** *Always*

She drove the rest of the way home on autopilot, walked through her front door to her parents asking how it went, mumbled something about it being fine, and retreated to her room.

Maya had texted: *How was it? Did you survive?*

**Sophia:** *Survived. His dad basically told me to know my place. His mom served perfect pie. I smiled through it all like a pageant contestant.*

**Maya:** *Ugh. I'm sorry. Want to talk about it?*

**Sophia:** *Not tonight. Tomorrow?*

**Maya:** *Tomorrow. Game first, emotional processing after.*

Sophia set her phone aside and lay back on her bed, staring at her ceiling. The dinner had confirmed what she already knew: she was the complication. The variable. The friend who could be tolerated as long as she stayed in her lane and didn't interfere with the master plan.

And she would. She would be his friend, nothing more, because that's what he needed. Even if it killed her.

Even if every time he smiled at her or touched her hand or said she made him remember who he used to be, she felt like she was choosing to break her own heart.

Her phone buzzed one more time.

**Ethan:** *Sleep well, Soph.*

**Sophia:** *You too.*

But she didn't sleep well. She lay awake replaying every moment of the evening—Robert's pointed questions, Caroline's measuring looks, Ethan's quiet fury on her behalf—and tried to figure out how to be satisfied with friendship when her heart wanted so much more.

Outside her window, Winnipeg glittered in the October dark, and Sophia whispered to the ceiling: "I'm not the variable in his equation. I'm just noise in the data."

If she said it enough times, maybe she'd start to believe it.
