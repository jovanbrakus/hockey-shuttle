# Chapter 1: Integration

## Previously On...

*Two weeks ago, Sophia Chen returned to Winnipeg after six years away, reconnecting with her childhood friend Ethan Price—now the star center of St. Paul's High School's hockey team and dating the most popular girl in school. Their Sunday morning skating session at Bell MTS Iceplex reminded them both of who they used to be, before life got tangled. Before his parents' ambitions. Before her family moved away. Before Becca Martinez.*

*"See you Monday, Soph," he'd said, using the nickname only he remembered.*

*She'd driven home knowing everything had changed, and nothing had.*

The problem with hot chocolate at The Forks on a late September afternoon is that it makes you believe in things that don't exist.

Sophia wrapped both hands around the paper cup, watching steam curl into air that smelled of cinnamon and burnt sugar from the nearby BeaverTails stand. She'd checked her phone twice in the last ten minutes—no new Instagram notifications, thank god—and was trying to focus on Maya Foster's story about Coach Patterson's latest motivational speech. Something involving a badminton birdie and the nature of resilience. But Sophia's attention kept drifting to the picnic table fifteen feet away.

Ethan Price sat with his back to the Red River, golden hour light making his dark hair look almost bronze. His arm rested along the back of the bench behind Becca Martinez, who was laughing at something Jordan Nakamura had just said. The whole scene looked like it belonged on St. Paul's High School's Instagram feed: beautiful people being effortlessly beautiful in a beautiful place.

"—and then she made us all hold the birdie above our heads for like five minutes," Maya was saying. "My arms are still sore. Are you even listening?"

"Yes. Birdie. Resilience. Sore arms." Sophia took a sip of hot chocolate and immediately burned her tongue. Perfect. That's what she got for not paying attention.

Maya followed her gaze, then sighed. "You know, for someone who claims to be 'just friends' with Ethan Price, you spend a lot of time watching him."

"I'm not watching him. I'm observing group dynamics. It's sociological research."

"Right. And I'm not eating this cookie, I'm conducting a taste experiment." Maya bit into her double chocolate cookie with pointed emphasis. "How's that working out for your heart?"

Before Sophia could formulate a response that sounded anything other than pathetic, Ethan turned around. His eyes found hers across the crowded market space like he'd known exactly where she was the whole time. He smiled—not the magazine-cover smile he gave everyone else, but something smaller, more real—and gestured for them to come over.

"Sociological research," Maya muttered. "Sure."

The walk across fifteen feet of weathered dock felt like crossing a border checkpoint. Sophia was hyper-aware of her jeans (old), her St. Paul's Badminton hoodie (new but not stylish), and the way her hair was probably doing that thing where it tried to escape her ponytail in five different directions. At least no one had their phones out. The last thing she needed was more social media drama.

"Sophia! Maya!" Becca Martinez shifted to make room, patting the bench beside her like they were all best friends. Which made everything so much worse. It would be easier if Becca was terrible. She wasn't. She was kind and genuine and apparently incapable of noticing that her boyfriend had entire conversations with his childhood friend using only eye contact.

"We were just talking about homecoming," Becca said as they sat down. "Are you guys going?"

"Probably," Maya said easily. She'd been in Winnipeg her whole life, transferred to St. Paul's from St. Mary's Academy freshman year, and had the kind of social confidence Sophia envied. "Sophie and I might go together. Girl squad."

Sophie. She'd been in Winnipeg three weeks and already had a second nickname. Back in Millbrook, she'd just been Sophia. Occasionally Chen. Here she was Soph (Ethan only) and Sophie (everyone else) and sometimes that girl who's really good at badminton (overheard in hallways).

"You should definitely come," Becca said warmly. "The fall dance is pretty great. They do it outside if the weather holds—lanterns and everything."

Sophia nodded, trying not to look at Ethan. She could feel him watching her the way you feel sunlight on your skin.

"Speaking of outside," Jordan said, "we were thinking of heading to the skateboard park after this. You guys in?"

"Can't," Maya said. "My mom's picking me up in twenty minutes. Family dinner thing."

"Sophie?" Jordan asked, and there was something measuring in his look, like he was testing a hypothesis.

"I don't skateboard," Sophia said quickly. "I'd just watch."

"Perfect," Ethan said, his first words since they'd joined the group. "I don't skateboard either. We can judge everyone else's form together."

Becca laughed. "Ethan Price, afraid of a skateboard but throws himself in front of hundred-mile-an-hour slap shots."

"It's about control," Ethan said, but he was still looking at Sophia. "Hockey, I know. Skateboarding?" He shrugged. "Too many variables."

Too many variables. That was exactly how Sophia felt about being here, sitting in his orbit while his girlfriend braided her perfect blonde hair and Jordan studied them both like they were characters in a play he was directing.

"Well, I'm in," Becca said, finishing her braid with a practiced twist. "Someone needs to document Jordan's inevitable fall."

"I landed that kickflip last week—"

"You landed on your ass," cut in Tyler Chen (no relation, different spelling), who played right wing on the hockey team. "There's video evidence."

The group devolved into good-natured arguing about who had the worst skateboarding track record. Sophia found herself relaxing into the conversation, offering occasional comments, mostly listening. This was nice, she realized. Normal. She could do this—be part of Ethan's world without wanting to live in it.

Then Ethan shifted, reaching for his coffee, and his knee bumped against hers under the table. He didn't move it away. Neither did she.

Maya's warning echoed in her head: *How's that working out for your heart?*

Not great, honestly. Not great at all.

The thing about The Forks in late September is that summer's holding on by its fingernails but autumn's already moved into its bones. The market still bustled with tourists and locals, but vendors were selling pumpkin spice everything instead of lemonade, and the trees along the riverbank were starting their slow burn from green to gold.

Sophia watched a family with three kids chase pigeons near the Children's Museum while the group finished their drinks. The smallest kid—maybe five years old—kept trying to hug the birds, arms spread wide, completely convinced this time would be different. This time they wouldn't fly away.

She understood the feeling.

"Okay," Maya said, checking her phone. "My mom's five minutes out. Sophie, you sure you don't need a ride?"

Sophia glanced at Ethan, who was watching her with an expression she couldn't read. "I'm good. Thanks though."

Maya leaned in close enough that only Sophia could hear. "Sociological research, right?"

"Shut up," Sophia muttered, but she was smiling.

After Maya left, the group migrated toward the skateboard park near the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The building loomed in the background, all glass and limestone angles, catching the lowering sun and throwing it back in shattered pieces.

Sophia fell into step beside Ethan, half a pace behind the others. This was dangerous—being alone-but-not-alone with him. It's how they'd ended up at the iceplex on Sunday morning. It's how she kept ending up in situations where her heart had opinions her brain definitely didn't approve.

"So," Ethan said casually, "how's badminton?"

"Good. Made varsity, so that's cool. First tournament's in two weeks."

"I know. You told me. Twice." He was grinning now. "In the group chat and then again in AP Calc."

Had she? Sophia replayed the last two weeks of conversations and winced. She'd definitely mentioned it twice. Maybe three times. "I'm excited."

"You should be. Coach Patterson doesn't put juniors on varsity unless they're seriously good." He bumped her shoulder with his. "My dad knows her from the athletic director meetings. He said she called you 'championship material.'"

That falling-elevator feeling hit. "Your dad talks about me?"

"Mentioned you once. In passing." Something shifted in Ethan's expression, a cloud crossing the sun. "He and my mom want to meet you, actually. They remember you from when we were kids."

"Oh." She tried to imagine sitting across from Robert and Caroline Price, the power couple who'd moved their nine-year-old son to Winnipeg for better hockey opportunities, who had his next eight years planned down to which NCAA Division I program would give him the best shot at the NHL. "That sounds... formal."

"It is formal. That's the problem." Ethan's jaw tightened in a way that reminded her of Sunday morning, when he'd talked about MIT and engineering and all the things he wanted that weren't hockey. "They've invited you to dinner next Friday. My mom called it 'reconnecting with Ethan's childhood friend.' I call it 'vetting someone who might distract him from his hockey future.'"

The bitterness in his voice surprised her. Ethan was usually so controlled, so careful about what he showed the world. But here, with her, walking half a step behind their friends, he let it show.

"I don't have to come," Sophia said quietly.

"I want you to come." He said it fast, like he'd been holding it in. "I just wanted to warn you. They're going to ask about your academic plans, your goals, whether you're planning to stay in Winnipeg for college. They're going to measure whether you're a positive influence or a distraction."

"Which am I?"

Ethan looked at her, and for a second the world condensed to just the two of them standing on a path by the river, September light going golden, friends calling from up ahead. "Both," he said finally. "Definitely both."

Before she could ask what that meant, Becca turned back and waved. "Come on, slowpokes! Jordan's about to attempt the impossible!"

They jogged to catch up, and Sophia told herself that whatever had just happened—that moment of honesty—was just Ethan being Ethan. Open. Real. The way he was with everyone.

Except he wasn't. She'd watched him at school these past weeks. He had different versions of himself: Hockey Ethan (focused, intense), Boyfriend Ethan (attentive, charming), Student Ethan (smart but carefully not too smart), and Friend Ethan (easy, funny, well-liked).

But with her, especially when they were sort-of alone, he was just Ethan. The kid who used to quiz her on multiplication tables while they skated circles around the outdoor rink in Millbrook. The kid who cried when his family told him they were moving but pretended he was excited. The kid who wrote her letters for six months before they both got busy with new lives.

That Ethan was dangerous. That Ethan could break her heart.

---

Jordan's "impossible" attempt turned out to be a kickflip off a low rail, which he landed with surprising grace while Tyler filmed and provided running commentary like a sports announcer.

"And Jordan Nakamura sticks the landing! The crowd goes wild!"

"There is no crowd," Becca pointed out, but she was laughing.

"Sophia and Sophie are the crowd. Crowd of two. Still counts."

Sophia found herself laughing too, pulled into the easy rhythm of their friendship. This was what she'd been missing in Millbrook—not romance, just this. People. Connection. The casual intimacy of inside jokes and shared history she wasn't part of yet but could be, if she stayed long enough.

Ethan leaned against the fence beside her, not skating, just watching. Their shoulders touched. She didn't move away.

"Your turn," Tyler called, pointing his phone at them. "Let's see what childhood friends can do."

"Hard pass," Ethan said. "I value my face. NHL scouts don't love facial scarring."

"What about you, Sophie?" Jordan asked. "Secret skateboarding skills we should know about?"

Sophia shook her head. "I tried once. In Millbrook. I have video evidence of exactly how badly it went."

"Now I need to see this video," Becca said, coming to stand on Ethan's other side. She linked her arm through his with easy possession, and Sophia felt something twist in her chest. Not jealousy exactly. More like grief for a thing that never existed.

"It's lost to time," Sophia lied. It wasn't lost. It was on her old phone in a drawer somewhere, her thirteen-year-old self eating concrete while her Millbrook friends laughed. "Probably for the best."

"Come on," Ethan said suddenly, pushing off the fence. "If we're not skating, let's at least walk. There's somewhere I want to show Sophia."

Becca frowned slightly. "What about—"

"We'll be right back. Ten minutes." He was already walking, and Sophia found herself following like they were tethered, like she'd always follow him wherever he led.

Behind them, she heard Tyler say something she couldn't quite catch, then Jordan's response: "Dude, they've known each other since they were kids. It's not like that."

But Jordan's voice had a question in it. And Sophia realized suddenly that she wasn't the only one analyzing variables and trying to solve for X.

---

The "somewhere" Ethan wanted to show her turned out to be a bench overlooking the Red River, tucked behind a stand of trees that blocked the view from the skateboard park. The city stretched out across the water—St. Boniface's cathedral spire catching the last light, downtown towers beginning to glow with evening windows.

"I come here sometimes," Ethan said, sitting down. "When practice gets intense or my parents are being... a lot. It's quiet."

Sophia sat beside him, leaving careful space between them. "It's nice."

"Yeah." He was quiet for a moment, watching the river. "I meant what I said. About you being both a positive influence and a distraction."

"Ethan—"

"Let me— just, let me finish." He turned to face her, and his expression was so earnest it hurt to look at. "Having you back, it's like— I don't know how to explain this." He ran his hand through his hair again. "I remember who I was? Before everything got so... planned out. Does that make sense?"

"Yeah, I—"

"And like, you make me want— the engineering thing. MIT. I actually think about it now instead of just... not thinking about it. Because that's easier, you know? Not thinking. Just following the path they—" He stopped. "That's the positive part. You make me think again."

"And the distraction part?"

He smiled, but there was something tangled in it. Took a breath. "You make me think about stuff I can't— things I can't have right now. Like MIT. Engineering. A life that's actually mine instead of—" He gestured vaguely. "And you make me remember that I used to be, like, happier? Is that weird to say? That's distracting when you're trying to stay focused on the thing everyone expects you to do."

Her heartbeat was in her ears, loud and uneven. This felt like a confession, but she couldn't tell what exactly he was confessing to. Friendship? Regret? Something more that neither of them could name?

"I don't want to mess things up for you," she said carefully.

"You won't. You couldn't." He said it with such certainty that she almost believed him. "I just needed you to know that having you here is good. Even when it's... a lot."

"A lot because of Becca?"

The question slipped out before she could stop it, and immediately she wanted to take it back. But Ethan didn't look away.

"A lot because of everything," he said quietly. "But yeah. Becca's— she's great. She's been great all summer. It's just..." He trailed off, staring at the river.

"Not what you expected?"

"Not what I—" He laughed, frustrated. "I don't feel what I'm supposed to feel. You know?" He stood up abruptly, running a hand through his hair. "We should get back. They'll— they'll think we got lost or whatever."

Sophia stood too, her mind racing. *Not what I feel.* What did that mean? What was he feeling? And why was he with Becca if—

"Hey." Ethan's voice pulled her back. He was holding something out to her—a fresh cup of hot chocolate from the market cart they'd passed. "Almost forgot. Extra marshmallows, right?"

She stared at the cup, then at him. "You remembered."

"Of course I remembered. You put like fifteen in your hot chocolate when we were kids. Your mom said you'd get cavities."

"She wasn't wrong." Sophia took the cup, their fingers brushing. The hot chocolate was still warm, and the marshmallows floated on top exactly the way she liked—a thick layer, already melting into sweet foam.

He'd gotten this before they even started walking. He'd planned this moment, this small gesture of remembered history.

"Thank you," she said, and meant it for more than just the drink.

"Come on." Ethan started walking back toward the skateboard park. "Jordan's probably attempted three more impossible tricks by now."

They walked in comfortable silence, drinking their hot chocolate, the sun painting everything amber and gold. Sophia thought about complicated things and feelings that didn't match and the way Ethan Price remembered her favorite ratio of marshmallows to cocoa.

Maya's voice echoed again: *How's that working out for your heart?*

Not great, honestly. But maybe—in this golden moment, walking beside him with marshmallows melting on her tongue and his smile still warm in her memory—maybe not great was good enough.

---

By the time they got back, full darkness was creeping in and the group was packing up. Jordan had indeed attempted three more tricks, eating concrete on two of them, and Tyler had enough video footage for what he kept calling his "documentary on athletic hubris."

"There you are!" Becca jogged over, looking relieved. "I was about to send a search party."

"Sorry," Ethan said easily, slipping back into Boyfriend Ethan like changing clothes. "Wanted to show Sophie the river view."

"It's pretty at sunset," Becca agreed, then noticed Sophia's hot chocolate. "Ooh, where'd you get that?"

"Ethan got it for me." Sophia held up the cup, suddenly self-conscious. Was it weird? Did girlfriends notice when boyfriends bought hot chocolate for childhood friends?

But Becca just smiled. "That's sweet. He's always doing stuff like that. Last week he brought me coffee in the middle of practice because I'd texted that I was tired." She linked her arm through Ethan's again, natural and easy. "He's a good one."

"Yeah," Sophia said, breathing getting complicated. "He is."

They all walked back through The Forks together, the market closing down for the evening, vendors pulling shutters and counting registers. Sophia found herself in the middle of the group, half-listening to Tyler and Jordan argue about the physics of skateboarding while Ethan and Becca walked slightly ahead, her head on his shoulder.

It was fine. This was fine. She could be friends with Ethan, part of his life, without wanting more. She could watch him with Becca and be happy for them. She could drink hot chocolate he'd bought her with extra marshmallows and not read anything into it beyond friendship.

She could do all of that.

She was definitely lying to herself, but sometimes lying felt safer than the truth.

---

By the time Sophia got home, her parents were setting the table for dinner and her little brother David was sprawled on the couch doing homework with the kind of focus that meant he was actually playing games on his phone.

"How was The Forks?" her mom asked, carrying out a steaming pot of dumplings.

"Good. Met some of Ethan's friends."

Her mom's eyebrows rose with interest. "Ethan Price? From Millbrook? I didn't know you two reconnected."

"Yeah. He goes to St. Paul's." Sophia helped set out plates, avoiding her mother's gaze. Lisa Chen had a particular talent for reading subtext, and Sophia wasn't ready to discuss the subtext of her afternoon.

"That's nice, sweetie. It's good you have a friend here."

A friend. Right. That's exactly what they were.

David looked up from his "homework." "Is he the hockey guy you used to skate with? The one whose parents were super intense?"

"That's him."

"Is he still good?"

"At hockey? Yeah. Really good. Like, probably-going-to-the-NHL good."

David made an impressed noise and went back to his phone-homework. Sophia's dad emerged from his home office, looking tired but pleased. Mark Russell was an aerospace engineer at StandardAero, one of the reasons they'd moved to Winnipeg. Better job, more opportunities, closer to family. All good reasons that didn't make Sophia miss Millbrook any less.

Except lately, she'd been missing Millbrook a little less. Lately, she'd been settling into Winnipeg like maybe it could be home.

"So," her dad said, sitting down at the head of the table. "How's school? Badminton? Social life?"

This was his weekly check-in, the engineer's approach to parenting: gather data, analyze trends, adjust variables as needed. Normally Sophia found it endearing. Tonight it felt exhausting.

"School's good. Made varsity badminton. Social life is... developing."

"That's wonderful, Sophie." Her dad beamed. "See? Moving here was the right choice."

Was it? Sophia wasn't sure. Three weeks ago she would have said no absolutely not, I want to go home. But now, after afternoons at The Forks and hot chocolate with extra marshmallows and the way Ethan's smile reached different corners when he looked at her...

"Yeah," she said finally. "Maybe it was."

After dinner, Sophia retreated to her room—still half-unpacked, still not quite hers—and pulled out her physics homework. But she couldn't focus. Her mind kept drifting back to the bench by the river, to Ethan's confession: *You make me think about things I can't have right now.*

She pulled out her phone, opened their text thread. No new messages since this morning when he'd sent a meme about AP Calculus that had made her snort-laugh in chemistry.

Her thumbs hovered over the keyboard. What do you say to someone who's both your oldest friend and a complete mystery? Someone who has a girlfriend but buys you hot chocolate the way you liked it when you were nine?

Finally, she typed: *thanks for the hot chocolate. and for showing me your spot*

Three dots appeared immediately, like he'd been waiting for her to text. Then: *anytime soph*

Another bubble: *see you monday*

Just friends, she told herself firmly. They were just friends.

But she fell asleep thinking about his hand almost-touching hers across the picnic table, and the way he'd said "both"—positive influence and distraction, all tangled up—and she wondered if maybe friendship was more complicated than she'd thought.

Or maybe she was just really bad at it.

---

Monday morning arrived with rain—cold, insistent, autumn rain that made Winnipeg feel smaller and grayer. Sophia parked her mom's Honda in the St. Paul's lot and sprinted for the main entrance, dodging puddles and already-soaked students.

Inside, the hallways smelled like wet clothes and teenage desperation. First day back after a weekend always had this particular energy, everyone slightly feral, readjusting to structure.

She found Maya at their usual spot by the science wing lockers, surrounded by a small crowd of badminton teammates. Priya Shah and Emma Davidson were both juniors like Sophia and Maya, both good enough to make varsity but not quite as good as Sophia, which had created a interesting dynamic. Not hostile, exactly. Just... measured.

"Sophie!" Maya waved her over. "We were just talking about Saturday's practice. Coach wants to run extra drills for your tournament."

"Can't wait," Sophia said, meaning it. Badminton made sense. Clear rules, definable outcomes, skill she could control. Unlike literally everything else in her life right now.

"Speaking of tournaments," Priya said, her dark eyes sharp with interest, "I heard you were at The Forks with Ethan Price and his crew on Saturday."

News traveled fast at St. Paul's. Sophia had been here three weeks and was still adjusting to how quickly information moved through social networks she wasn't quite part of.

"Yeah. Just hanging out."

"Just hanging out," Emma repeated, loading the words with meaning. "With Ethan Price. Who has a girlfriend."

"Becca was there too," Sophia said quickly. "The whole group was there."

"Mm-hmm." Priya exchanged a look with Emma that Sophia couldn't decode. "And then you two disappeared for like twenty minutes."

Oh god. They'd been noticed. Of course they'd been noticed. Privacy didn't exist in high school, and apparent privacy definitely didn't exist when one of you was Ethan Price.

Maya jumped in, bless her. "It's not like that. Sophie and Ethan are old friends. From before. They're just reconnecting."

"Sure," Emma said, but she was smiling. "Friends."

The bell rang, saving Sophia from having to explain something she didn't understand herself. The crowd dispersed toward first period, and Maya fell into step beside her.

"Sorry," Maya said quietly. "People are curious. Ethan doesn't usually... he's pretty exclusive with his time. Him bringing someone new into the group gets noticed."

"I'm not new. We've known each other since we were kids."

"You're new here. That's what matters." Maya hesitated, then added, "Just be careful, okay? Emma's cousin is friends with Becca. Word gets around."

Nausea hit. "There's nothing to get around. We're friends."

"I know that. You know that. Does Ethan know that?"

The question followed Sophia through the morning like a shadow. AP Calculus, European History, Chemistry—she moved through classes on autopilot, her mind chewing on Maya's words.

Did Ethan know they were just friends? Did she?

Because sitting in that hidden spot by the river, drinking hot chocolate he'd bought with her childhood preferences memorized, listening to him talk about MIT and dreams he'd shelved—that hadn't felt like just friendship.

But it had to be. He was with Becca. He'd been with Becca all summer. And even if he wasn't—even if by some miracle he felt what she felt—his parents would never approve. She was the distraction, the girl who made him remember engineering when he was supposed to be focused on hockey.

She was the variable that didn't fit the equation.

---

Lunch brought unexpected chaos.

Sophia had gotten used to eating with Maya and some of the badminton team at their usual table near the windows. Safe, predictable, drama-free. But today, halfway through her sandwich, Jordan Nakamura materialized beside their table with his lunch tray and his easy smile.

"Mind if I sit?" He didn't wait for an answer, just slid into the seat across from Sophia. "Tyler's got some meeting and Ethan's eating with Becca, so I'm temporarily teamless."

Maya's eyebrows climbed toward her hairline, but she moved her backpack to make room. Priya and Emma exchanged another one of those loaded looks.

"How's the documentary coming?" Sophia asked, grateful for neutral territory.

"Excellent. I've titled it *Hubris on Wheels: A Cautionary Tale*. Thinking of submitting it to film festivals." Jordan took a bite of his sandwich, chewed thoughtfully, then said with careful casualness, "So you and Ethan seem tight."

There it was. Apparently everyone wanted to discuss her relationship with Ethan Price today.

"We're friends," Sophia said for the third time that day. "From when we were kids."

"Right. Friends." Jordan said it the same way Emma had, with too much emphasis. "It's cool. Ethan needs more friends who knew him before he was Ethan Price, star center, future NHL draft pick. He gets weird about it sometimes."

Sophia studied Jordan, trying to figure out what game he was playing. But his expression was open, genuine. Not testing—observing.

"What do you mean, weird?" she asked.

Jordan shrugged. "Like he forgets who he actually is. Gets caught up in who everyone expects him to be." He paused. "But with you, he seems more... relaxed. Real."

Maya was watching this conversation like it was a tennis match, head swiveling between them. Priya and Emma had given up any pretense of their own discussion and were just openly listening now.

"He's always been real," Sophia said quietly. "Even when we were nine."

"Yeah." Jordan smiled, and it was warm, without agenda. "That's what he says about you too."

Before Sophia could figure out how to respond to that, the cafeteria doors opened and Ethan walked in with Becca and Tyler. They were laughing about something, Becca's hand in Ethan's, picture-perfect as always.

Ethan's eyes scanned the cafeteria, found Sophia, and something in his expression shifted. Not unhappy exactly. Just... harder to read.

He said something to Becca, who nodded, then he was walking toward their table. Jordan grinned like this was exactly what he'd expected.

"Hey," Ethan said, stopping beside Jordan. "Stealing my friends, Nakamura?"

"Someone has to keep Sophie entertained while you're otherwise occupied." Jordan's tone was light, but Sophia caught the edge underneath. A question hiding in statement form.

Ethan's jaw tightened fractionally. "Yeah, well, I'm back now."

"Good." Jordan stood, grabbing his tray. "Because I've got questions about the AP Calc homework and Sophie's better at explaining derivatives than you are."

"Rude," Ethan said, but he was smiling. "Also accurate."

Jordan left, and Ethan slid into his vacated seat like it had been waiting for him. Across the cafeteria, Sophia saw Becca watching, her expression uncertain.

"Should you—" Sophia started.

"It's fine. She's catching up with the student council people." Ethan pulled out his calc homework, covered in his careful handwriting. "So. Derivatives. Jordan wasn't lying—I have questions."

For the next twenty minutes, they worked through problems while Maya and Priya and Emma gradually drifted into their own conversations. It felt like Sunday morning at the iceplex, or those afternoons at The Forks—just the two of them, falling into old patterns, the world shrinking down to whiteboard markers and equations.

"No, look," Sophia said, leaning over to point at his work. "You're taking the derivative correctly, but you're forgetting to apply the chain rule here—"

"Oh." Ethan's hand moved to correct it, and his shoulder pressed against hers. Neither of them moved away. "That's why it wasn't working."

"The chain rule is sneaky like that."

He turned to look at her, and they were suddenly very close—closer than necessary for homework discussion. She could see the exact color of his eyes, brown with tiny flecks of gold, and the small scar through his left eyebrow from a hockey accident in eighth grade.

"Thanks," he said quietly. "For this. For making it make sense."

"That's what friends do, right?" The word felt like swallowing glass, but she said it anyway. Friends. That's what they were.

"Right." Something flickered across his face—disappointment? relief?—gone too fast to analyze. "Friends."

The bell rang, shattering the moment. Students surged toward the doors, and Ethan gathered his homework with quick efficiency.

"See you in AP Calc," he said, already backing away. "And Sophie? Thanks. Really."

Then he was gone, swallowed by the crowded hallway, and Sophia was left sitting at the table with Maya, who was looking at her with something between sympathy and exasperation.

"Just friends," Maya said flatly. "Sure, Sophie. Keep telling yourself that."

Sophia didn't answer. She couldn't. Because Maya was right, and admitting it felt like jumping off a cliff without knowing if there was water below.

So instead she gathered her stuff and headed to fifth period, her shoulder still warm where Ethan's had pressed against it, and tried very hard not to think about the way he'd looked at her when he said "friends."

Like maybe he was lying to himself too.
