# Chapter 3: Game Theory

Saturday morning began with Maya's car horn blaring outside Sophia's house at nine AM, two full hours before Ethan's game.

Sophia stumbled downstairs in pajamas, squinting against October sunlight, to find Maya leaning against her ancient Civic with two coffee cups and a grin.

"Too early," Sophia called through the open door.

"Nonsense. We have important pre-game rituals to establish." Maya held up the coffees. "I brought bribes."

"What rituals? I've been to one game."

"Exactly. Amateur. We need to get you properly initiated into hockey game culture." Maya's grin widened. "Also I need to hear every detail about last night's dinner and you've been avoiding my texts."

Sophia had been avoiding texts, calls, and all forms of human contact since the Hayes family dinner. She'd spent Friday night and Saturday morning doing physics homework and trying to convince herself she was fine with being Just Friends.

"Let me get dressed," she said, surrendering. "Give me ten minutes."

"Eight," Maya called. "We're on a schedule."

Sophia made it downstairs in seven minutes—jeans, St. Paul's hoodie, hair in a messy ponytail—grabbed her coat and the coffee Maya offered, and let herself be dragged to the car.

"So," Maya said once they were driving toward the mall. "Dinner."

"It was fine."

"Liar. You texted me that his dad basically told you to know your place."

"Okay, it was terrible. But politely terrible. Like, smiling-while-explaining-boundaries terrible." Sophia took a long sip of coffee—perfectly made, extra cream—and felt marginally more human. "His parents are intense. They've got his whole life mapped out and I'm the complication that doesn't fit the plan."

"Did Ethan defend you?"

"Tried to. His dad shut it down." Sophia stared out the window at Winnipeg rolling past—strip malls and residential streets, everything starting to look familiar. "The message was clear: I can be his friend as long as I stay in my lane and don't distract him from hockey or Becca."

"That's messed up."

"That's reality." Sophia turned to look at Maya. "Where are we going? The game isn't until eleven."

"First," Maya said, pulling into the Polo Park shopping center parking lot, "we're establishing our pre-game ritual. Coffee—check. Now we need lucky game day snacks, which we will purchase from that very specific candy store that has Swedish Fish and sour keys in bulk."

"Why Swedish Fish?"

"Because they're delicious and you need something to stress-eat during the intense moments." Maya found a parking spot and turned off the engine. "Also because I've decided we're making this a Thing. You and me, game days, snacks and friendship solidarity."

Something warm uncurled in Sophia's chest. "You're making this a Thing for me."

"Obviously. You look like you're about to spontaneously combust from repressed feelings, and I refuse to let you implode before our tournament." Maya's expression softened. "Plus, you're my friend. Friends make Things."

They spent the next hour wandering the mall, purchasing entirely too much candy, trying on sunglasses they had no intention of buying, and generally existing in the kind of easy companionship Sophia had been missing since Millbrook. Maya was good at this—pulling her out of her own head, making her laugh, reminding her that life existed outside the Ethan Price emotional crisis zone.

By the time they headed to Bell MTS Iceplex, Sophia felt almost normal. Ready. She could watch a hockey game, support her friend, and keep her heart from doing stupid things.

That lasted approximately thirty seconds into warm-ups.

---

The thing about watching Ethan Price play hockey is that it rewires your understanding of grace.

Sophia had seen him skate before—the Sunday morning session, casual and easy—but that was Ethan at fifty percent. This was Ethan at full intensity: explosive speed, impossible precision, the kind of control that made physics look like choreography.

"Okay," Maya said beside her, watching Ethan execute a perfect wrist shot that went top shelf past the backup goalie. "I see why he's got scouts watching. That was... wow."

"Yeah," Sophia managed. Her coffee had gone cold in her hands.

They'd gotten seats three rows up from the glass, right at center ice—Maya's doing, she'd texted someone on the team to find out where the "good seats" were. The arena was maybe half full, early season Saturday game, but the energy was building. Parents, students, serious-looking adults with clipboards who were probably scouts.

"There's Becca," Maya said, nodding toward the section on the other side of the arena. Becca sat with a group of girls—student council types, perfectly coordinated in school colors—all waving enthusiastically at the ice.

Sophia felt a twist of something uncharitable. She squashed it. Becca hadn't done anything wrong. Becca was exactly what Ethan needed: uncomplicated support, clear boundaries, appropriate ambition.

Then Ethan skated past their section during warm-ups, and his head turned. Their eyes met through the glass. He smiled—not the magazine-cover smile, the real one—and deliberately shot the puck toward their section. It hit the glass directly in front of them with a satisfying thunk.

Sophia noticed phones immediately coming out around them—people filming, taking photos of warm-ups. She felt a flutter of anxiety. Last time people had their phones out around her and Ethan, it had caused problems.

Maya burst out laughing. "Oh my god, he's showing off for you."

"He's just—that's just warm-ups. Everyone shoots at the glass."

"Uh-huh. And I'm the Queen of England." Maya pulled out her phone. "I'm documenting this. Jordan needs to see it."

"Don't you dare—"

But Maya was already typing. Thirty seconds later, her phone buzzed.

"Jordan says, and I quote: 'Hayes is such a disaster. This is going to be fun to watch.'" Maya showed Sophia the text, grinning wickedly. "He also says Ethan's been quote 'weird all morning, keeps checking his phone, asked three times if we were sure you were coming.'"

Sophia's heart did something complicated. "He was probably just—"

"Sophie. Babe. Friend of my heart." Maya turned to look at her seriously. "You're allowed to admit this means something. I won't tell anyone. But you're killing yourself pretending it doesn't."

Before Sophia could figure out how to respond to that, the national anthem started. Everyone stood, hands over hearts, and the game began.

---

The first period was brutal—fast, physical, both teams clearly matched. Ethan played center, taking most of the faceoffs, and Sophia found herself holding her breath every time he touched the puck.

He was incredible. There was no other word for it. The way he read the ice, anticipated plays, moved like he was three steps ahead of everyone else. But there was something extra today—an edge, an intensity that seemed almost reckless.

"He's taking more chances," Maya observed during a TV timeout. "See that? He went for the wraparound instead of passing to the open wing."

She was right. Ethan was playing like he had something to prove, going for the spectacular instead of the safe. And it was working—he'd assisted on Tyler's goal five minutes in, nearly scored twice himself—but Sophia could see Coach Richards yelling from the bench about something.

The second period started with even more intensity. Ethan won the faceoff, passed back to the defense, then immediately drove toward the net. The opposing center tried to check him—hard, into the boards—but Ethan bounced off like he'd barely felt it and was back on the play in seconds.

"He's playing angry," Maya said, leaning forward. "Look at his face."

Sophia looked. Maya was right. Ethan's jaw was set, his movements sharper than usual, almost aggressive. Every shift, he was going hard—backchecking with intensity, finishing every check, playing forty-five seconds when most players could barely handle thirty.

On his third shift of the period, he nearly got in a fight. The opposing defenseman had been targeting him all game—small hooks, slashes when the refs weren't looking. This time, after Ethan beat him wide and nearly scored, the guy cross-checked him from behind.

Ethan spun around fast, dropping his gloves halfway before Tyler grabbed him, pulling him away. The ref called a penalty on the other team—two minutes for cross-checking—but Ethan skated to the bench still burning with adrenaline.

"Intensity's good," Sophia heard Jordan say from a few rows behind them. "But he needs to channel it better or he's gonna get himself suspended."

Coach Richards was clearly saying the same thing, based on his gestures. But when Ethan came back out for the power play, he was even more focused—controlled aggression instead of wild energy.

And that's when everything changed.

Then, eight minutes left in the second period, it happened.

Ethan stole the puck at center ice, deked past one defender, then another. Instead of passing to Jordan who was wide open, he went for it himself—full speed, one-on-one with the goalie. Time seemed to slow down. The defenseman was closing fast. Ethan should pull up, make the safe play.

Instead he went high glove side, impossible angle, and the puck went in so fast the goalie never moved.

The arena exploded. Sophia was on her feet screaming before she realized she'd stood up. Maya was yelling beside her, candy flying everywhere. On the ice, Ethan's teammates mobbed him—Tyler jumping on his back, Jordan pounding his helmet—but through the celebration, Ethan was already looking up.

His eyes found hers in the crowd. Found her specifically, like he'd known exactly where she was sitting. Time seemed to stretch as he skated toward their section, his teammates still celebrating around him.

Then he pointed. Directly at her. Not vague, not general—his arm extended, his finger aimed right at her face, and he was smiling that real smile, the one that wasn't performance.

Everything went sharp at the edges—the way it did before a tournament serve, her body deciding fight or flight without asking permission. The noise of the arena faded to white noise. Her hands went to her mouth without conscious decision, and she felt heat everywhere—chest, neck, cheeks, her whole torso trying to protect something.

"Oh my god," Maya said beside her, grabbing her arm. "Did he just—"

"He did," Sophia whispered, still standing, still staring. Her whole body was pulsing now, her heartbeat too loud, too fast. She couldn't hold still. "He just—in front of everyone—"

Around them, phones were up. So many phones. Recording, filming, taking photos. This moment was being captured from every angle, would be on Instagram Stories within minutes, probably already being texted to group chats. Sophia felt exposed, seen, claimed in the most public way possible.

On the ice, Tyler had noticed where Ethan was pointing and started laughing, shoving Ethan toward the bench. Jordan was grinning, shaking his head. The whole team had seen it. Everyone in their section had definitely seen it.

And across the arena—Sophia's eyes finally tracked there—Becca was standing too, clapping, but her smile had frozen. Her head turned, following Ethan's point, finding Sophia in the crowd.

Their eyes met for one horrible second. Becca's expression shifted—confused, then understanding, then hurt. Before her friend beside her said something and she sat down.

"I need to sit down," Sophia said faintly, sinking back into her seat. Her legs felt like water. She couldn't stop trembling.

"You need to process what just happened," Maya said, sitting too but keeping her hand on Sophia's arm—grounding, supportive. "He just claimed you. Publicly. In front of his girlfriend, his team, everyone. That wasn't subtle, Sophie. That was a declaration."

Sophia couldn't breathe right. The arena was still celebrating—horn blaring, crowd cheering—but all she could feel was the weight of that point. The deliberateness of it. The way Ethan had found her eyes first, like he'd needed her to know it was for her.

"He was just excited. It doesn't mean—"

"Sophie." Maya grabbed her arm. "He. Pointed. At. You. That means something."

The rest of the period passed in a blur. Sophia's hands were shaking. She kept replaying the moment—his eyes finding hers through the crowd, that deliberate point, the way he'd smiled like he'd done it just for her.

Friends didn't do that. Players didn't dedicate goals to Just Friends while their girlfriends watched from across the arena.

Her phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number: *this is jordan*

*maya gave me your number*

*we need to talk after the game*

*about ethan*

*dont worry its not bad*

*just... we should talk*

Sophia stared at the message, anxiety spiking. What did Jordan want to talk about? How much had he noticed? How much did everyone notice?

She opened Instagram, immediately regretting it. Three people had already tagged her in Stories—clips of Ethan's goal, his point, her reaction. The comments were starting: heart emojis, ship names, speculation. Her notifications were climbing by the second.

The third period was scoreless—both teams exhausted, playing defensive. St. Paul's won 3-2, Ethan's goal proving to be the game winner. As the final buzzer sounded, Sophia felt relief and dread in equal measure.

"Okay," Maya said, gathering their candy debris. "Post-game tradition: we wait for them to change, then group outing to Stella's Diner. You ready?"

"Not even a little bit."

"Perfect. Let's go."

---

Stella's Diner was a Winnipeg institution—red vinyl booths, chrome accents, a jukebox that still played actual records. The kind of place that served breakfast all day and knew everyone's orders by heart.

By the time Sophia and Maya arrived, half the team was already there, crowded into the big corner booth. Tyler, Jordan, a few other guys Sophia recognized from the hallways. And Ethan, freshly showered, hair still damp, wearing jeans and his St. Paul's Hockey hoodie.

He lit up when he saw her. Actually, visibly, lit up.

"Sophie! Maya!" He was sliding out of the booth, gesturing them over. "We saved you seats."

"Seats" turned out to be the booth bench next to Ethan, which required everyone shuffling around. Somehow—and Sophia would bet actual money this was Jordan's doing—she ended up pressed between Ethan and the wall, their legs definitely touching under the table.

Maya slid in across from them next to Jordan, who was watching them both with barely concealed amusement.

"Great game," Maya said to the table at large. "That goal in the second period? Insane."

"Which one?" Tyler asked. "Because Ethan's wraparound was—"

"The one where he went full solo hero mode instead of passing to me," Jordan cut in, but he was grinning. "Yeah, that was pretty sick."

Ethan shrugged, looking pleased with himself. "Felt right."

"Felt reckless," said Marcus Webb, one of the defensemen. "Coach is going to make you run drills for that."

"Worth it." Ethan turned to look at Sophia, and they were close enough that she could see the gold flecks in his eyes again. "Did you like it?"

This felt like a loaded question. Like he was asking something bigger than whether she'd enjoyed a hockey goal.

"It was incredible," Sophia said honestly. "Physics shouldn't work that way but you made it work anyway."

"Physics," Jordan said slowly, "is not how most people describe hockey goals."

"Most people aren't as smart as Sophie," Ethan said, still looking at her, and the pride in his voice made her chest tight.

The waitress arrived—Dolores, according to her name tag, probably sixty, definitely taking no nonsense from a table full of teenage hockey players. She took their orders with practiced efficiency, barely writing anything down.

Sophia ordered a grilled cheese and fries because her stomach was too knotted to handle anything complex. Ethan ordered the same thing, which he'd always done when they were kids—matching her order because "if it's good enough for Sophie, it's good enough for me."

"So," Tyler said once Dolores had left, "homecoming. Three weeks away. Everyone got their situations figured out?"

"Got my ticket," Marcus said. "Going with some friends."

"I'm taking Rachel," Tyler continued. "Finally worked up the nerve to ask."

"About time," Jordan muttered. "You've been pining since September."

"What about you, Nakamura? Got a date?"

Jordan shrugged. "Thinking about asking someone. Still deciding."

"Mysterious." Tyler turned his attention to Sophia and Maya. "What about you two? Going together? Looking for dates? Give us something to work with here."

"We're going together," Maya said firmly. "Girl squad."

"Girl squad," Sophia echoed, grateful for the easy out.

"Ethan's going with Becca, obviously," Marcus said. "Where is she, by the way?"

"Student council meeting," Ethan said, and something shifted in his posture. "She'll be here later."

The conversation moved on—homecoming planning, terrible freshman year dance stories, Tyler's detailed plan to ask Rachel that involved way too many candles and potential fire hazards. But under the table, Sophia was hyperaware of Ethan's leg pressed against hers, neither of them moving away.

This was dangerous. This was crossing lines. They were in a public place surrounded by his teammates and his girlfriend was going to show up any minute and his leg was warm against hers and she couldn't make herself move away.

Their food arrived. Sophia focused on her grilled cheese like it was the most important thing in the world. Beside her, Ethan was doing the same thing, both of them carefully not looking at each other, both of them acutely aware of every point of contact.

"Okay but seriously," Tyler said, gesturing with a fry, "that goal? I've been on the team with you for two years and I've never seen you play that aggressive. What was different today?"

Ethan shrugged, but Sophia felt him tense beside her. "Just felt focused."

"Focused," Jordan repeated, and his tone was loaded with meaning. "Sure. That's one word for it."

Marcus leaned forward, grinning. "He's been different all week. Keeps checking his phone in the locker room, smiling at nothing. Tyler thought he was sick."

"I did not—"

"You literally asked if he had a fever," Marcus interrupted. "Yesterday. In the shower."

"The point is," Tyler said, "something's got him in his feelings. And based on that goal dedication—"

"Can we not?" Ethan cut in, but he was smiling despite the embarrassment in his voice. "Can we please not do this?"

"Do what?" Maya asked innocently, though Sophia could see she was enjoying this. "Discuss the fact that you pointed at Sophie after scoring? In front of the entire arena?"

"Girl squad's got jokes," Jordan said, but he was watching Ethan with that assessing director's gaze. "But she's not wrong. That was pretty public, man."

Ethan's jaw tightened. Under the table, his leg pressed more firmly against Sophia's—whether seeking comfort or offering it, she couldn't tell.

"It was a heat of the moment thing," Ethan said finally, his voice careful. "I scored, I was excited, I saw Sophie in the crowd. That's it."

"Uh-huh," Marcus said, clearly not believing a word. "And the fact that you asked Coach three times yesterday if we were sure she was coming to the game?"

Ethan's ears went slightly red. "I didn't—"

"You did," Tyler confirmed. "Jordan and I were there. You were weirdly intense about it."

Sophia wanted to sink through the floor. Or possibly combust. Both seemed like reasonable options. Everyone was looking at them now—her and Ethan, pressed together in the booth, his leg against hers, tension thick enough to cut.

"We're friends," Sophia said, trying to rescue the situation. "Childhood friends. That's—that's allowed, right? Friends support friends?"

"Of course," Jordan said smoothly. "Though most friends don't get goal dedications. Or have dinner with each other's parents. Or look at each other like—"

"Jordan," Ethan warned.

"What? I'm just observing." Jordan's grin was wicked. "You know, for my documentary. This is great character development."

"I will end your documentary," Ethan threatened, but there was no heat in it.

Maya was watching this whole exchange with barely suppressed laughter. When she caught Sophia's eye, she mouthed: *You okay?*

Sophia wasn't sure. The attention was overwhelming. But also—there was something oddly thrilling about it. About everyone seeing what had been carefully hidden. About Ethan's friends teasing him about her. About being claimed, even if it complicated everything.

"So Sophie," Jordan said casually, clearly enjoying himself, "how was dinner with the Price family last night?"

The entire table went quiet at the shift. Ethan's leg tensed against hers.

"It was good," Sophia said carefully. "His parents are intense but nice."

"Intense is an understatement," Ethan muttered. "My dad practically interviewed her."

"That's what parents do," Marcus said. "They vet. My mom does the same thing with anyone I bring around."

"Sophia's not—" Ethan started, then stopped. "We're friends. From when we were kids. She's not being brought around, she's just... around."

Just around. Sophia tried not to let that sting. He was right—she was just around, just a friend, just the complication he kept having to explain.

"Sure," Jordan said, and there was definitely subtext there. "Friends."

Before Sophia could analyze what that meant, the diner door opened and Becca walked in with two other student council girls. She spotted their table immediately and headed over, smiling.

"Hey! Sorry I'm late." She slid into the booth next to Tyler, across from Ethan. "Meeting ran long. How was the game? I saw you scored, babe!"

"Yeah, felt good." Ethan's smile was warm but measured—Boyfriend Ethan, performing the role. "We were just talking about homecoming."

"Oh good! I wanted to coordinate colors." Becca pulled out her phone. "I was thinking maybe navy blue? It would look good on both of us."

"Sure, whatever you want."

Sophia focused on her fries, trying to become invisible. This was Becca's space—girlfriend, homecoming dates, coordinated colors. Sophia was just the friend sitting too close under the table.

Except Ethan hadn't moved his leg away. Even with Becca here, even in front of everyone, he kept that point of contact. And Sophia hated herself for how much that mattered.

The conversation flowed around her. Maya kept shooting her concerned looks. Jordan was watching everyone with that same assessing gaze, like he was directing a play and taking notes on each actor's performance.

Then Becca said something that made Sophia's blood freeze.

"By the way, Ethan, my parents want us to come over for dinner next Saturday. Family thing—they want to talk about your hockey season, college plans, all that." Becca paused, then added with careful casualness, "I didn't know you had dinner with Sophia's family last night."

"Other way around," Ethan corrected. "She had dinner with my parents."

"Oh." Becca's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "That's nice. Reconnecting with old friends."

The emphasis on "old friends" was pointed. Sophia wanted to sink through the floor.

"My parents invited her," Ethan said, and there was an edge in his voice. "They remembered her from when we were kids. It wasn't a big deal."

"Of course not." Becca's voice was light, but Sophia could hear the question underneath: *Why didn't you tell me? Why do your parents want to meet your childhood friend? What am I supposed to think about this?*

Maya kicked Sophia under the table—gentle, supportive. *This is awkward and I'm here for you.*

"Anyway," Becca continued, redirecting, "Saturday? Six PM? My mom's making lasagna."

"Can't," Ethan said quickly. "I have that hockey clinic thing. The youth league coaching."

"That's not until four. You'd be done by five-thirty."

"Right, but I'll be exhausted—"

"Ethan." Becca's voice was still light, but there was steel underneath. "It's one dinner. My parents specifically asked for next Saturday."

Sophia watched him struggle with it—the performance, the obligation, the box he was trapped in. Finally he nodded.

"Yeah. Okay. Six PM. Lasagna. Got it."

"Great!" Becca's smile returned to full wattage. "Now, tell me about this goal everyone keeps texting me about. Tyler said you went full showboat?"

As Ethan described the goal—downplaying it, making it sound less spectacular than it was—Sophia felt something shift in her chest. This was his life: performing for his parents, performing for his girlfriend, being who everyone needed him to be.

And she was just the person who made him remember who he used to be. The complication. The distraction. The variable.

Under the table, his leg was still pressed against hers. But it felt different now—less like connection, more like something they were both pretending wasn't happening.

---

The group stayed at Stella's for another hour—too much coffee, shared plates of fries, the easy chaos of people comfortable with each other. Sophia mostly listened, occasionally contributing, trying to figure out when it would be socially acceptable to leave.

Maya was her lifeline, keeping up conversation, deflecting attention when Sophia went quiet. Jordan too, surprisingly—he seemed to sense her discomfort and would steer the conversation away whenever it got too personal or too close to relationship territory.

Finally, around four PM, people started drifting away. Marcus had a family thing. Tyler needed to pick up his sister. The table emptied in waves until it was just Sophia, Maya, Ethan, Jordan, and Becca.

"We should go too," Maya said, reading Sophia's desperation. "Got homework to deal with."

"Same," Jordan said, standing. "Need to edit that documentary footage."

Which left Ethan and Becca. Couple time. As it should be.

"I'll walk you out," Ethan said, sliding out of the booth. To Becca, he added, "Be right back."

"Okay." Becca was scrolling through her phone, but Sophia saw her eyes track them as they left.

Outside, the October afternoon was cold and getting colder—the sun already lowering, shadows long. Maya and Jordan headed toward their cars, leaving Ethan and Sophia in a pocket of semi-privacy.

"Thanks for coming," Ethan said, hands shoved in his pockets. "To the game. It meant a lot."

"You played really well."

"I played better because you were there." He said it simply, like it was just fact. "I always— I just always do."

Her ribcage felt two sizes too small. "Ethan—"

"I know. I know I shouldn't— stuff like that. Saying stuff like that. I know it's a mess." He ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "But it's true. When you're watching, I want to— I want to be better. The person you remember. Not just the hockey player everyone else sees, you know?"

"You are that person. You don't have to prove anything to me."

"Maybe I want to anyway." He looked at her, and the vulnerability in his expression hurt. "This is all— it's so messed up. You being back. My parents. Becca. All of it. I don't know how to—" He made a frustrated gesture. "I can't figure out how to—"

He stopped, shaking his head. "Never mind. I should— I should get back. Becca's waiting."

"Yeah. You should."

Neither of them moved.

"Ethan?" Jordan's voice came from across the parking lot. "Need something from my car. Come help?"

It was clearly a rescue—giving Ethan an excuse to leave, to end this moment before it became something neither of them could take back.

"Coming," Ethan called. Then, quieter, just to Sophia: "See you Monday?"

"See you Monday."

He walked away, and Sophia stood there in the cold, trying to understand what had just happened. What they'd almost said. What it all meant.

Maya appeared at her elbow. "You okay?"

"No."

"Yeah. I figured." Maya steered her toward the car. "Come on. Let's go consume ice cream and discuss the disaster that is your life."

"It's not a disaster."

"Sophie. Babe. Friend of my heart." Maya unlocked the car, and they both got in. "He pointed at you after scoring a goal. While his girlfriend watched. Your life is absolutely a disaster."

Sophia couldn't argue with that, so she just buckled her seatbelt and let Maya drive to the nearest DQ—because when your life was imploding, only a Blizzard would do.

They got their ice cream and sat in Maya's car in the parking lot, heater running, condensation forming on the windows like they were in their own little world.

"Okay," Maya said, attacking her Oreo Blizzard with determination. "Let's process. He dedicated a goal to you in front of everyone. Including Becca. What are you feeling?"

Sophia took a bite of her Reese's Blizzard, trying to find words for the chaos in her chest. "Guilty, mostly. But guilt that feels suspiciously like hope around the edges."

"That's valid."

"Is it though?" Sophia set down her spoon, suddenly not hungry. "He has a girlfriend, Maya. A girlfriend who was sitting right there watching him point at another girl. That's—I'm the other girl. I'm the one making him act like this."

"No." Maya's voice was firm. "He's the one making himself act like this. You're not controlling him. You're just existing, being yourself, and he's the one who can't handle it."

"But what if I'm encouraging it? What if by being around him, by going to his games, by—" Sophia's voice cracked. "What if I'm the reason he's going to mess everything up?"

Maya reached over and grabbed her hand. "Listen to me. Ethan Price is almost eighteen years old. He's smart, he's capable of making his own decisions, and if he's having feelings he can't control, that's on him to manage. Not you."

"But his parents—"

"His parents don't get to dictate who he has feelings for. And neither does Becca, honestly. I like Becca, she's great, but you can't force someone to feel what they don't feel." Maya squeezed her hand. "The real question is: what do you want?"

That was the question, wasn't it? Sophia stared out at the darkening parking lot, at the other cars with their own stories, their own complications.

"I want him," she whispered. "I want to be the person he points at. I want to be the one sitting next to him at dinner, wearing coordinated homecoming colors, being part of his actual life instead of just the complication he has to explain." She wiped at her eyes, frustrated with herself. "But I also want him to be happy. And I don't think choosing me makes him happy. It just makes everything harder."

"Or," Maya said gently, "maybe it makes things honest. Maybe all this performing he's doing—for his parents, for Becca, for everyone—maybe that's what's actually making him miserable."

Sophia didn't have an answer for that. She just ate her ice cream in silence while Maya put on music—something upbeat and empowering, because Maya was good at reading moments—and they sat there until the Blizzards were gone and Sophia felt marginally more human.

"Better?" Maya asked.

"Getting there."

"Good. Because I refuse to let you implode before our badminton tournament next weekend. I need you functional." Maya started the car. "Now let's get you home so you can overthink this in the privacy of your own room like a normal teenager."

Despite everything, Sophia laughed. "You're the worst."

"I'm the best and you know it."
