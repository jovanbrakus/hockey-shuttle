# Chapter 3: Game Theory

Saturday morning began with Maya's car horn blaring outside Sophia's house at nine AM, two full hours before Ethan's game.

Sophia stumbled downstairs in pajamas, squinting against October sunlight, to find Maya leaning against her ancient Civic with two coffee cups and a grin.

"Too early," Sophia called through the open door.

"Nonsense. We have important pre-game rituals to establish." Maya held up the coffees. "I brought bribes."

"What rituals? I've been to one game."

"Exactly. Amateur. We need to get you properly initiated into hockey game culture." Maya's grin widened. "Also I need to hear every detail about last night's dinner and you've been avoiding my texts."

Sophia had been avoiding texts, calls, and all forms of human contact since the Hayes family dinner. She'd spent Friday night and Saturday morning doing physics homework and trying to convince herself she was fine with being Just Friends.

"Let me get dressed," she said, surrendering. "Give me ten minutes."

"Eight," Maya called. "We're on a schedule."

Sophia made it downstairs in seven minutes—jeans, Westwood hoodie, hair in a messy ponytail—grabbed her coat and the coffee Maya offered, and let herself be dragged to the car.

"So," Maya said once they were driving toward the mall. "Dinner."

"It was fine."

"Liar. You texted me that his dad basically told you to know your place."

"Okay, it was terrible. But politely terrible. Like, smiling-while-explaining-boundaries terrible." Sophia took a long sip of coffee—perfectly made, extra cream—and felt marginally more human. "His parents are intense. They've got his whole life mapped out and I'm the complication that doesn't fit the plan."

"Did Ethan defend you?"

"Tried to. His dad shut it down." Sophia stared out the window at Winnipeg rolling past—strip malls and residential streets, everything starting to look familiar. "The message was clear: I can be his friend as long as I stay in my lane and don't distract him from hockey or Becca."

"That's messed up."

"That's reality." Sophia turned to look at Maya. "Where are we going? The game isn't until eleven."

"First," Maya said, pulling into the Polo Park shopping center parking lot, "we're establishing our pre-game ritual. Coffee—check. Now we need lucky game day snacks, which we will purchase from that very specific candy store that has Swedish Fish and sour keys in bulk."

"Why Swedish Fish?"

"Because they're delicious and you need something to stress-eat during the intense moments." Maya found a parking spot and turned off the engine. "Also because I've decided we're making this a Thing. You and me, game days, snacks and friendship solidarity."

Something warm uncurled in Sophia's chest. "You're making this a Thing for me."

"Obviously. You look like you're about to spontaneously combust from repressed feelings, and I refuse to let you implode before our tournament." Maya's expression softened. "Plus, you're my friend. Friends make Things."

They spent the next hour wandering the mall, purchasing entirely too much candy, trying on sunglasses they had no intention of buying, and generally existing in the kind of easy companionship Sophia had been missing since Thunder Bay. Maya was good at this—pulling her out of her own head, making her laugh, reminding her that life existed outside the Ethan Hayes emotional crisis zone.

By the time they headed to Bell MTS Iceplex, Sophia felt almost normal. Ready. She could watch a hockey game, support her friend, and keep her heart from doing stupid things.

That lasted approximately thirty seconds into warm-ups.

---

The thing about watching Ethan Hayes play hockey is that it rewires your understanding of grace.

Sophia had seen him skate before—the Sunday morning session, casual and easy—but that was Ethan at fifty percent. This was Ethan at full intensity: explosive speed, impossible precision, the kind of control that made physics look like choreography.

"Okay," Maya said beside her, watching Ethan execute a perfect wrist shot that went top shelf past the backup goalie. "I see why he's got scouts watching. That was... wow."

"Yeah," Sophia managed. Her coffee had gone cold in her hands.

They'd gotten seats three rows up from the glass, right at center ice—Maya's doing, she'd texted someone on the team to find out where the "good seats" were. The arena was maybe half full, early season Saturday game, but the energy was building. Parents, students, serious-looking adults with clipboards who were probably scouts.

"There's Becca," Maya said, nodding toward the section on the other side of the arena. Becca sat with a group of girls—student council types, perfectly coordinated in school colors—all waving enthusiastically at the ice.

Sophia felt a twist of something uncharitable. She squashed it. Becca hadn't done anything wrong. Becca was exactly what Ethan needed: uncomplicated support, clear boundaries, appropriate ambition.

Then Ethan skated past their section during warm-ups, and his head turned. Their eyes met through the glass. He smiled—not the magazine-cover smile, the real one—and deliberately shot the puck toward their section. It hit the glass directly in front of them with a satisfying thunk.

Maya burst out laughing. "Oh my god, he's showing off for you."

"He's just—that's just warm-ups. Everyone shoots at the glass."

"Uh-huh. And I'm the Queen of England." Maya pulled out her phone. "I'm documenting this. Jordan needs to see it."

"Don't you dare—"

But Maya was already typing. Thirty seconds later, her phone buzzed.

"Jordan says, and I quote: 'Hayes is such a disaster. This is going to be fun to watch.'" Maya showed Sophia the text, grinning wickedly. "He also says Ethan's been quote 'weird all morning, keeps checking his phone, asked three times if we were sure you were coming.'"

Sophia's heart did something complicated. "He was probably just—"

"Sophie. Babe. Friend of my heart." Maya turned to look at her seriously. "You're allowed to admit this means something. I won't tell anyone. But you're killing yourself pretending it doesn't."

Before Sophia could figure out how to respond to that, the national anthem started. Everyone stood, hands over hearts, and the game began.

---

The first period was brutal—fast, physical, both teams clearly matched. Ethan played center, taking most of the faceoffs, and Sophia found herself holding her breath every time he touched the puck.

He was incredible. There was no other word for it. The way he read the ice, anticipated plays, moved like he was three steps ahead of everyone else. But there was something extra today—an edge, an intensity that seemed almost reckless.

"He's taking more chances," Maya observed during a TV timeout. "See that? He went for the wraparound instead of passing to the open wing."

She was right. Ethan was playing like he had something to prove, going for the spectacular instead of the safe. And it was working—he'd assisted on Tyler's goal five minutes in, nearly scored twice himself—but Sophia could see Coach Richards yelling from the bench about something.

Then, eight minutes left in the second period, it happened.

Ethan stole the puck at center ice, deked past one defender, then another. Instead of passing to Jordan who was wide open, he went for it himself—full speed, one-on-one with the goalie. Time seemed to slow down. The defenseman was closing fast. Ethan should pull up, make the safe play.

Instead he went high glove side, impossible angle, and the puck went in so fast the goalie never moved.

The arena exploded. Sophia was on her feet screaming before she realized she'd stood up. Maya was yelling beside her, candy flying everywhere. On the ice, Ethan's teammates mobbed him, but he was skating toward their section, pointing directly at Sophia through the celebration.

"Oh my god," Maya said. "Did he just—"

"He did," Sophia whispered, still standing, heart absolutely thundering. "He just dedicated that goal to you. In front of everyone. Including Becca."

Sophia finally looked across the arena. Becca was standing too, clapping, but her expression was confused. She'd seen where Ethan was pointing.

"I need to sit down," Sophia said faintly.

"You need to process what just happened."

"He was just excited. It doesn't mean—"

"Sophie." Maya grabbed her arm. "He. Pointed. At. You. That means something."

The rest of the period passed in a blur. Sophia's hands were shaking. She kept replaying the moment—his eyes finding hers through the crowd, that deliberate point, the way he'd smiled like he'd done it just for her.

Friends didn't do that. Players didn't dedicate goals to Just Friends while their girlfriends watched from across the arena.

Her phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number: *This is Jordan. Maya gave me your number. We need to talk after the game. About Ethan. Don't worry, it's not bad. Just... we should talk.*

Sophia stared at the message, anxiety spiking. What did Jordan want to talk about? How much had he noticed? How much did everyone notice?

The third period was scoreless—both teams exhausted, playing defensive. Westwood won 3-2, Ethan's goal proving to be the game winner. As the final buzzer sounded, Sophia felt relief and dread in equal measure.

"Okay," Maya said, gathering their candy debris. "Post-game tradition: we wait for them to change, then group outing to Stella's Diner. You ready?"

"Not even a little bit."

"Perfect. Let's go."

---

Stella's Diner was a Winnipeg institution—red vinyl booths, chrome accents, a jukebox that still played actual records. The kind of place that served breakfast all day and knew everyone's orders by heart.

By the time Sophia and Maya arrived, half the team was already there, crowded into the big corner booth. Tyler, Jordan, a few other guys Sophia recognized from the hallways. And Ethan, freshly showered, hair still damp, wearing jeans and his Westwood Hockey hoodie.

He lit up when he saw her. Actually, visibly, lit up.

"Sophie! Maya!" He was sliding out of the booth, gesturing them over. "We saved you seats."

"Seats" turned out to be the booth bench next to Ethan, which required everyone shuffling around. Somehow—and Sophia would bet actual money this was Jordan's doing—she ended up pressed between Ethan and the wall, their legs definitely touching under the table.

Maya slid in across from them next to Jordan, who was watching them both with barely concealed amusement.

"Great game," Maya said to the table at large. "That goal in the second period? Insane."

"Which one?" Tyler asked. "Because Ethan's wraparound was—"

"The one where he went full solo hero mode instead of passing to me," Jordan cut in, but he was grinning. "Yeah, that was pretty sick."

Ethan shrugged, looking pleased with himself. "Felt right."

"Felt reckless," said Marcus Webb, one of the defensemen. "Coach is going to make you run drills for that."

"Worth it." Ethan turned to look at Sophia, and they were close enough that she could see the gold flecks in his eyes again. "Did you like it?"

This felt like a loaded question. Like he was asking something bigger than whether she'd enjoyed a hockey goal.

"It was incredible," Sophia said honestly. "Physics shouldn't work that way but you made it work anyway."

"Physics," Jordan said slowly, "is not how most people describe hockey goals."

"Most people aren't as smart as Sophie," Ethan said, still looking at her, and the pride in his voice made her chest tight.

The waitress arrived—Dolores, according to her name tag, probably sixty, definitely taking no nonsense from a table full of teenage hockey players. She took their orders with practiced efficiency, barely writing anything down.

Sophia ordered a grilled cheese and fries because her stomach was too knotted to handle anything complex. Ethan ordered the same thing, which he'd always done when they were kids—matching her order because "if it's good enough for Sophie, it's good enough for me."

"So," Tyler said once Dolores had left, "homecoming. Three weeks away. Everyone got their situations figured out?"

"Got my ticket," Marcus said. "Going with some friends."

"I'm taking Rachel," Tyler continued. "Finally worked up the nerve to ask."

"About time," Jordan muttered. "You've been pining since September."

"What about you, Nakamura? Got a date?"

Jordan shrugged. "Thinking about asking someone. Still deciding."

"Mysterious." Tyler turned his attention to Sophia and Maya. "What about you two? Going together? Looking for dates? Give us something to work with here."

"We're going together," Maya said firmly. "Girl squad."

"Girl squad," Sophia echoed, grateful for the easy out.

"Ethan's going with Becca, obviously," Marcus said. "Where is she, by the way?"

"Student council meeting," Ethan said, and something shifted in his posture. "She'll be here later."

The conversation moved on—homecoming planning, terrible freshman year dance stories, Tyler's detailed plan to ask Rachel that involved way too many candles and potential fire hazards. But under the table, Sophia was hyperaware of Ethan's leg pressed against hers, neither of them moving away.

This was dangerous. This was crossing lines. They were in a public place surrounded by his teammates and his girlfriend was going to show up any minute and his leg was warm against hers and she couldn't make herself move away.

Their food arrived. Sophia focused on her grilled cheese like it was the most important thing in the world. Beside her, Ethan was doing the same thing, both of them carefully not looking at each other, both of them acutely aware of every point of contact.

"So Sophie," Jordan said casually, "how was dinner with the Hayes family last night?"

The entire table went quiet. Ethan's leg tensed against hers.

"It was good," Sophia said carefully. "His parents are intense but nice."

"Intense is an understatement," Ethan muttered. "My dad practically interviewed her."

"That's what parents do," Marcus said. "They vet. My mom does the same thing with anyone I bring around."

"Sophia's not—" Ethan started, then stopped. "We're friends. From when we were kids. She's not being brought around, she's just... around."

Just around. Sophia tried not to let that sting. He was right—she was just around, just a friend, just the complication he kept having to explain.

"Sure," Jordan said, and there was definitely subtext there. "Friends."

Before Sophia could analyze what that meant, the diner door opened and Becca walked in with two other student council girls. She spotted their table immediately and headed over, smiling.

"Hey! Sorry I'm late." She slid into the booth next to Tyler, across from Ethan. "Meeting ran long. How was the game? I saw you scored, babe!"

"Yeah, felt good." Ethan's smile was warm but measured—Boyfriend Ethan, performing the role. "We were just talking about homecoming."

"Oh good! I wanted to coordinate colors." Becca pulled out her phone. "I was thinking maybe navy blue? It would look good on both of us."

"Sure, whatever you want."

Sophia focused on her fries, trying to become invisible. This was Becca's space—girlfriend, homecoming dates, coordinated colors. Sophia was just the friend sitting too close under the table.

Except Ethan hadn't moved his leg away. Even with Becca here, even in front of everyone, he kept that point of contact. And Sophia hated herself for how much that mattered.

The conversation flowed around her. Maya kept shooting her concerned looks. Jordan was watching everyone with that same assessing gaze, like he was directing a play and taking notes on each actor's performance.

Then Becca said something that made Sophia's blood freeze.

"By the way, Ethan, my parents want us to come over for dinner next Saturday. Family thing—they want to talk about your hockey season, college plans, all that." Becca paused, then added with careful casualness, "I didn't know you had dinner with Sophia's family last night."

"Other way around," Ethan corrected. "She had dinner with my parents."

"Oh." Becca's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "That's nice. Reconnecting with old friends."

The emphasis on "old friends" was pointed. Sophia wanted to sink through the floor.

"My parents invited her," Ethan said, and there was an edge in his voice. "They remembered her from when we were kids. It wasn't a big deal."

"Of course not." Becca's voice was light, but Sophia could hear the question underneath: *Why didn't you tell me? Why do your parents want to meet your childhood friend? What am I supposed to think about this?*

Maya kicked Sophia under the table—gentle, supportive. *This is awkward and I'm here for you.*

"Anyway," Becca continued, redirecting, "Saturday? Six PM? My mom's making lasagna."

"Can't," Ethan said quickly. "I have that hockey clinic thing. The youth league coaching."

"That's not until four. You'd be done by five-thirty."

"Right, but I'll be exhausted—"

"Ethan." Becca's voice was still light, but there was steel underneath. "It's one dinner. My parents specifically asked for next Saturday."

Sophia watched him struggle with it—the performance, the obligation, the box he was trapped in. Finally he nodded.

"Yeah. Okay. Six PM. Lasagna. Got it."

"Great!" Becca's smile returned to full wattage. "Now, tell me about this goal everyone keeps texting me about. Tyler said you went full showboat?"

As Ethan described the goal—downplaying it, making it sound less spectacular than it was—Sophia felt something shift in her chest. This was his life: performing for his parents, performing for his girlfriend, being who everyone needed him to be.

And she was just the person who made him remember who he used to be. The complication. The distraction. The variable.

Under the table, his leg was still pressed against hers. But it felt different now—less like connection, more like something they were both pretending wasn't happening.

---

The group stayed at Stella's for another hour—too much coffee, shared plates of fries, the easy chaos of people comfortable with each other. Sophia mostly listened, occasionally contributing, trying to figure out when it would be socially acceptable to leave.

Maya was her lifeline, keeping up conversation, deflecting attention when Sophia went quiet. Jordan too, surprisingly—he seemed to sense her discomfort and would steer the conversation away whenever it got too personal or too close to relationship territory.

Finally, around four PM, people started drifting away. Marcus had a family thing. Tyler needed to pick up his sister. The table emptied in waves until it was just Sophia, Maya, Ethan, Jordan, and Becca.

"We should go too," Maya said, reading Sophia's desperation. "Got homework to deal with."

"Same," Jordan said, standing. "Need to edit that documentary footage."

Which left Ethan and Becca. Couple time. As it should be.

"I'll walk you out," Ethan said, sliding out of the booth. To Becca, he added, "Be right back."

"Okay." Becca was scrolling through her phone, but Sophia saw her eyes track them as they left.

Outside, the October afternoon was cold and getting colder—the sun already lowering, shadows long. Maya and Jordan headed toward their cars, leaving Ethan and Sophia in a pocket of semi-privacy.

"Thanks for coming," Ethan said, hands shoved in his pockets. "To the game. It meant a lot."

"You played really well."

"I played better because you were there." He said it simply, like it was just fact. "I always do."

Sophia's chest tightened. "Ethan—"

"I know. I know I shouldn't say stuff like that. I know it's complicated." He ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "But it's true. When you're watching, I want to be better. I want to be the person you remember, not just the hockey player everyone else sees."

"You are that person. You don't have to prove anything to me."

"Maybe I want to anyway." He looked at her, and the vulnerability in his expression hurt. "This is all so messed up. You being back, my parents, Becca, all of it. I don't know how to—"

He stopped, shaking his head. "Never mind. I should get back. Becca's waiting."

"Yeah. You should."

Neither of them moved.

"Ethan?" Jordan's voice came from across the parking lot. "Need something from my car. Come help?"

It was clearly a rescue—giving Ethan an excuse to leave, to end this moment before it became something neither of them could take back.

"Coming," Ethan called. Then, quieter, just to Sophia: "See you Monday?"

"See you Monday."

He walked away, and Sophia stood there in the cold, trying to understand what had just happened. What they'd almost said. What it all meant.

Maya appeared at her elbow. "You okay?"

"No."

"Yeah. I figured." Maya steered her toward the car. "Come on. Let's go consume ice cream and discuss the disaster that is your life."

"It's not a disaster."

"Sophie. Babe. Friend of my heart." Maya unlocked the car, and they both got in. "He pointed at you after scoring a goal. While his girlfriend watched. Your life is absolutely a disaster."

Sophia couldn't argue with that. So she just buckled her seatbelt and let Maya drive, and tried not to think about Ethan's leg against hers under the table, or the way he'd looked at her in the parking lot, or how she was supposed to survive being Just Friends when every interaction felt like slowly breaking her own heart.
