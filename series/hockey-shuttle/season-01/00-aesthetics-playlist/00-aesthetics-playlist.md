This is the story of two brilliant kids who were best friends at nine—before his father's ambitions tore them apart. Now they're seventeen, reunited in a city where the temperature hits -20°C and the ice never really melts. She's a badminton champion choosing her own path. He's an elite hockey player trapped in his father's dream. Together, they'll have to decide: follow the plan, or risk everything for freedom.

## CREATOR NOTES

**Why This Playlist:**

This playlist follows the complete emotional arc of Season 1—from reunion to falling in love to fighting for freedom. Each song connects to specific scenes and moments in the episodes. Listen in order for the full journey, or jump to individual songs when reading specific episodes.

**Visual Aesthetic Notes:**

The aesthetics combine the coldness of Winnipeg winter (ice blues, whites) with the warmth of their connection (golds, ambers). The contrast between his controlled, expensive world (steel grays) and their chosen future (navy MIT blue) runs throughout. Every image should feel both intimate and cinematic—like a Netflix teen romance, but frozen solid.

**For Readers:**

Feel free to create your own aesthetic boards on Pinterest, TikTok, or Instagram using these prompts! Tag your creations with #HockeyShuttleSeason1 so other readers can find them. This is your story now too.
