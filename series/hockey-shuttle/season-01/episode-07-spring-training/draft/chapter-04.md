# CHAPTER 4: SPRING BREAK

## March 25th - Day One: Arrival

The airport was bright and sterile and full of people who weren't him. Sophia stood between her parents at arrivals, gate 3, watching the board that said his flight had landed ten minutes ago. Passengers were disembarking. He was somewhere in that crowd, getting closer with every second.

She'd changed clothes three times that morning. Eventually her mother had said, "Sophia, you look beautiful in anything, and he's not going to care what you're wearing," which was probably true but didn't stop her from checking her reflection in every window they passed.

Seventy days. Ten weeks. An entire winter of separation compressed into minutes now as travelers emerged from the security area, dragging luggage, checking phones, moving around them like water around stones.

Then there he was.

Ethan Price walking through the arrivals gate, backpack over one shoulder, looking thinner and harder than she remembered but unmistakably him. His eyes scanned the crowd and found her, and the world narrowed to just that—eye contact across twenty feet of airport terminal after seventy days of nothing.

He walked faster. So did she. Her parents stayed back, giving them this moment, and then they were standing in front of each other, close enough to touch but not quite touching yet because this was supervised and public and they'd both learned caution.

"Hi," Ethan said.

"Hi yourself."

"You cut your hair."

Sophia touched the shorter ends—she'd trimmed it three inches in February, something to change when everything else felt frozen. "You noticed."

"I notice everything about you." His hand twitched like he wanted to reach for her but wasn't sure if he could. "Can I—"

"Yes."

He hugged her. Just wrapped his arms around her and held on like she was the only solid thing in a tilting world. Sophia buried her face in his shoulder and breathed him in—different cologne, same underneath, still him—and felt seventy days of tension release all at once.

"You're really here," she said against his shirt.

"I'm really here."

They pulled back, and his hands found hers, fingers lacing together. Real. Present. Together.

Her parents approached, giving them those thirty seconds but present as required. Michael extended a hand. "Ethan. Good to see you."

"Professor Chen. Thank you for having me."

"It's just Michael this week. You're a guest, not a student." He gestured toward the parking area. "Let's get your bag and head home. I'm sure you're exhausted."

The drive back was strange—Sophia and Ethan in the back seat holding hands, her parents in front maintaining supervision but giving space. Spring had arrived in Winnipeg while winter held Massachusetts, everything here just slightly warmer, greener, alive in a way that felt like waking up.

"How was the flight?" Grace asked.

"Good. Long. I've been up since four AM." Ethan squeezed Sophia's hand. "Worth it."

"We thought you might want to rest this afternoon," Michael said. "Get adjusted. But if you're up for it, Sophia wanted to show you The Forks."

"I'm up for it." Ethan looked at Sophia. "I didn't come here to sleep."

The Forks was crowded with people celebrating spring—tourists and locals, families and couples, everyone drawn to the river confluence where the Assiniboine met the Red. Sophia and Ethan walked the paths while her parents trailed twenty feet behind, visible but distant, chaperoning without smothering.

"This is weird," Ethan said, not letting go of her hand. "Good weird. But weird."

"Being supervised?"

"Being together. Legally. In public. No hiding, no sneaking, just existing in the world like normal people."

"We've never been normal people."

"True." He steered them toward the market building. "Food? I'm starving."

They got coffee and pastries, sat at a table by the window, her parents at the next table over with newspapers they were clearly not reading. The supervision was obvious but not oppressive. A compromise everyone had agreed to.

"So," Sophia said. "You said you had something to tell me. Something big."

Ethan took a breath. "Not yet. Tonight. When we have more than public space. But I want to talk about college first."

"MIT?"

"MIT. Are we really doing this? Going together?"

Sophia wrapped her hands around her coffee cup. "I want to. But I need to know you're choosing it for you, not just for me. Because if you're following me to MIT when you'd rather be somewhere else—"

"I'm not." He leaned forward. "Sophia, I applied to MIT because it's the best STEM school in the country. Because their engineering program is exactly what I want. Because it's where I'd choose even if you weren't going. You being there too? That's not why I'm going. It's why I'm excited about going. There's a difference."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. Are you? Because if you're worried that people will think you chose it for me—"

"I chose it in November. Before we were really us. I have the early action acceptance to prove it." She smiled. "We keep coming back to this. Worrying that we're influencing each other badly. But maybe we need to trust that we're both smart enough to make our own choices."

"Even when those choices happen to align?"

"Especially then."

They sat with that for a moment, watching spring crowd the market, feeling the weight of decision lifting. MIT. Together. Not because of each other but alongside each other. Partnership, not dependence.

"Four more days," Ethan said. "Then I have to go back. Finish junior year, survive my dad's rage about me being here, graduate. Then summer, then college."

"Four months until you're eighteen."

"July 16th. Freedom." His expression shifted. "That's part of what I need to tell you tonight. About freedom. About what I've been working on."

Sophia wanted to push but didn't. Tonight. She could wait until tonight.

They walked back to her house as afternoon slipped into evening, her parents giving them the backseat privacy on the drive home. Tomorrow was science fair. Tonight was just existing in the same space, remembering how to be together after so much apart.

---

## March 26th - Day Two: Science Fair

The convention center was crowded with teenagers and trifold boards, the air electric with competition and nerves. Sophia and Ethan checked in at the registration desk, got their table assignment, set up their display. After months of video conferences and separate work, they were finally presenting as a team.

"You ready?" Ethan asked, adjusting their poster board one more time.

"We've practiced this a hundred times."

"Virtually. This is different."

"Better." Sophia aligned their research papers. "Stop fidgeting. We're good."

The judges came through in waves: groups of three, clipboards and critical eyes, asking questions designed to trip up unprepared students. But Sophia and Ethan had prepared. They tag-teamed answers, finished each other's thoughts, demonstrated the kind of intellectual partnership that couldn't be faked.

"Impressive collaboration," one judge noted. "Especially given you're working from different cities?"

"We make it work," Sophia said.

"Distance forces precision," Ethan added. "Every meeting has to count. Every calculation has to be verified independently. It's actually made us better researchers."

The judge made a note. "And you're both planning to study at MIT?"

"Yes, ma'am. Starting this fall."

"Well. They're getting two excellent students. Good luck."

By three PM, they'd presented to five judge groups, answered questions from other competitors interested in their methodology, and watched their parents network with other science fair parents in that way adults did. Michael and Grace had given them space all day, supervising from a distance, letting them be partners first.

"I think we did okay," Sophia said as crowds thinned.

"We did great." Ethan was reading the schedule. "Awards ceremony is at five. Want to walk around? Look at other projects?"

They wandered the convention center, critiquing research, impressed by some presentations and skeptical of others. At one point Ethan stopped in front of a physics project on quantum entanglement.

"You know what's weird?" he said.

"Quantum mechanics in general?"

"That." He gestured at the project. "Entanglement. Two particles connected across any distance. You measure one, the other changes instantaneously. No matter how far apart they are."

"Spooky action at a distance. Einstein hated it."

"Yeah, but it's real." Ethan looked at her. "That's kind of what we've been doing. Separated by distance but still connected. Changes in one affecting the other. Maybe that's what partnership is. Entanglement."

"That's both very romantic and extremely nerdy."

"I contain multitudes."

The awards ceremony at five PM felt anticlimactic only because they'd already won the important thing: presenting together, proving partnership, existing as collaborators in public. But when they announced first place—Sophia Chen and Ethan Price, entropy and information theory—the vindication was sweet.

They walked to the stage together, accepted the trophy and scholarship check together, smiled for the photographer together. Her parents stood in the audience with Jordan (who'd driven in for the day) and Maya (who'd skipped badminton practice to watch). A community. A family. Support that had been built piece by piece through winter's hardest months.

"We did it," Sophia said as they walked off stage.

"You doubted?"

"Sometimes. Yeah."

"I didn't. Not once." Ethan held the trophy, gold-painted plastic that meant everything. "Because we're better together. Distance doesn't change that."

Celebration dinner at her house—Thai food spread across the dining table, everyone talking over each other, recounting the day. Jordan teased them about being "nerd champions," Maya made them explain the entropy thing three times, her parents glowed with pride. And Ethan fit into it all seamlessly, part of the constellation that had formed around Sophia without her quite realizing it.

But as dinner wound down and people left—Jordan back to his dorm, Maya to evening practice—and her parents retreated to give them privacy, Sophia felt anticipation building. Tonight. He'd said tonight he'd tell her.

They sat in the living room, supervision maintained by her parents being upstairs with the bedroom door open, and Ethan pulled a folder from his backpack.

"Remember I said I had something to tell you?"

Sophia's heart kicked up. "Yeah."

"It's big. It changes things. But I think—I hope—it changes them in the right way." He handed her the folder. "Read this."

She opened it. Legal documents, official letterhead, language she didn't quite understand at first. Then the header came into focus:

PETITION FOR EMANCIPATION - ETHAN DAVID PRICE

Sophia looked up. "You're—what is this?"

"I filed for legal emancipation on February 20th. The day after the hearing." Ethan leaned forward, hands clasped, intense in that way he got when something mattered. "If the judge grants it, I become a legal adult at seventeen. Free to make my own decisions about school, living arrangements, finances, everything. My dad can't control me anymore."

"Can he—does he know?"

"He will when he's served the papers. Probably next week." Ethan met her eyes. "Sophia, I'm not doing this just for us. I'm doing it for me. Because I'm tired of living under his control, tired of every choice being filtered through his approval, tired of hockey and expectations and being who he wants instead of who I am."

Sophia's hands shook as she read through the documents. Financial plan. Academic record. Character references. He'd been building this case for months.

"Your dad's been helping you," she said, finding Michael Chen's name as legal advisor.

"Since January. I asked him not to tell you because I wasn't sure it would work. Didn't want to get your hopes up." Ethan took a breath. "The hearing is April 15th. If the judge grants emancipation, I'm legally free. I can finish school where I want, choose college without his interference, make decisions about my own life."

"And if she denies it?"

"Then I wait until July 16th when I turn eighteen naturally. Either way, I'm getting free. This just accelerates the timeline."

Sophia set down the folder, mind racing. "This is huge."

"I know."

"If you win—"

"When I win."

"If you win, your dad loses all legal authority over you. He'll be furious."

"He already is. This just makes it official." Ethan's jaw set. "I'm done letting him weaponize the courts. He used restraining orders to control me, so I'm using emancipation to free myself. Fighting back with the same system he tried to use against us."

"But you're seventeen. Don't you need money, housing, all of that?"

"I have a trust fund from my grandmother that releases when I'm eighteen. I can access it early with emancipation. That covers college. Your parents said I can stay here this summer if needed. I have plans, Sophia. Real plans that don't depend on him."

She looked at this boy who'd become so much more than she'd expected—not just her boyfriend, not just her science fair partner, but someone fighting for his own autonomy in ways that terrified and amazed her equally.

"When's the hearing?" she asked.

"April 15th."

"That's three weeks after you leave. I want to be there."

"You can't. It's in Massachusetts."

"Then I'll watch via video conference like you did for the restraining order hearing. I'm not letting you do this alone."

Ethan smiled, relieved and grateful and something else she couldn't quite name. "See? This is why. Not because you make decisions for me. Because you support me making my own decisions. That's what I need. What I've always needed."

They sat with that for a moment, the weight of it settling. Then Sophia leaned forward and kissed him—door open upstairs, parents present, supervised and legal and real.

"I'm proud of you," she said against his mouth.

"For what?"

"For fighting. For yourself. Not just for us."

"It's the same thing. Fighting for myself means I get to choose you. That's the point."

They kissed again, deeper this time, and Sophia felt the future shifting into new shapes. Emancipation. Freedom. Partnership built on choice instead of circumstance.

Upstairs, her father cleared his throat—the universal parent signal for "we're still here."

They broke apart, laughing.

"Three more days," Ethan said. "Then I go back and wait for the hearing."

"We wait for the hearing," Sophia corrected. "Together."

"Together."

---

## March 27th - Day Three: Badminton Tournament

The University of Manitoba athletics center was humid and bright, the thwack of shuttlecocks echoing off walls as Sophia warmed up. Her division played at ten AM, and Ethan sat in the bleachers with her parents, finally getting to watch her compete after months of hearing about it.

Maya appeared at her elbow. "He's here."

"I know."

"You nervous?"

"About badminton or about him watching?"

"Both."

Sophia rolled her shoulders, racket familiar in her hand. "I'm channeling everything. That's what you taught me. Separation, frustration, fear—all of it goes into the game."

"Then go destroy them."

She did.

First match in eighteen minutes: 21-12, 21-9. Her opponent barely touched the shuttle.

Second match took longer—a girl from Brandon who had excellent footwork—but Sophia won 21-17, 21-19.

Finals against a senior from a club in Steinbach, the reigning provincial champion. This was the one that mattered. Win here, and Sophia qualified for provincials. Lose, and her season ended.

Between games, Ethan appeared at the court edge where coaches and family could talk to players.

"You're incredible," he said.

"She's good. Really good."

"So are you. You're faster than her. Use that."

Sophia met his eyes. "Been watching badminton in your spare time?"

"Been watching you. There's a difference." He smiled. "Go win this."

The third game was war. Sophia used every trick Maya had taught her: crosscourt drops, overhead clears, net shots that died before her opponent could react. She was faster, younger, hungrier. She channeled three months of separation and legal battles and fighting for love into every shot.

Final score: 21-19.

Provincial qualification: secured.

Ethan was at the court edge immediately, and Sophia dropped her racket and hugged him, sweaty and exhausted and victorious.

"You did it," he said.

"I did it."

"When are provincials?"

"April 20th." She pulled back. "Five days after your hearing."

"Then we'll both have things to celebrate."

Her parents approached with water and congratulations, Maya grinning like she'd won herself, other players and coaches milling around. Sophia stood in the middle of it all with Ethan's hand in hers and felt the pieces of her life clicking together: academics, athletics, relationship, family. Not competing. Complementing.

"Ice cream to celebrate?" Michael suggested.

"Please," Sophia said.

They went to the place on Osborne, sat outside despite the chill because spring was spring and you didn't waste it. Sophia got her favorite mango swirl, Ethan got chocolate, they shared bites and talked about the tournament and the emancipation hearing and college housing deposits due in May.

"Two more days," Grace said gently. "Then back to long-distance."

"Until summer," Ethan said. "Then I'm free. One way or another."

"You'll stay with us," Michael said, and it wasn't a question. "After emancipation. You need a place, you have one."

Ethan's eyes got bright. "Thank you."

"Family takes care of family. That's how this works."

They finished ice cream and walked the neighborhood, her parents drifting ahead to give them space. The sun was stronger now, winter truly breaking, everything thawing into possibility.

"Tomorrow's our second-to-last day," Sophia said.

"Don't remind me."

"What do you want to do?"

"I don't care. Be with you. That's all I need."

They decided on skating—public skating at the community rink where Jordan sometimes played pickup hockey. Sophia hadn't been on ice in months, not since before Christmas, and being there with Ethan felt like returning to the beginning. They'd met skating. They'd both been five-year-old hockey kids who loved the ice more than the game. Coming back to it now, older and complicated and fighting for futures, felt right.

Ethan skated circles around her, showing off, and she laughed and tried to catch him. Her parents sat in the stands with coffee, watching their daughter be seventeen, happy, in love, supervised but free enough.

"I'm going to miss this," Ethan said, skating backward so he could face her.

"We'll do it again. Summer. When you're emancipated and free."

"When we're both free."

"We're already free." Sophia caught his hands, and they glided together, the rink mostly empty on a Thursday afternoon. "The court said we could be together. We're not hiding. This is freedom."

"You're right." He spun her gently, and she laughed. "This is what it's supposed to feel like."

They skated until the Zamboni came out, then changed back to shoes and drove home as afternoon became evening. Tomorrow was their last full day. The day after, Ethan's flight left at six AM. The countdown had started the moment he'd arrived, and now it was almost over.

But tonight they had family dinner, they had conversation and laughter and the comfort of being in the same room. They had her parents trusting them with unsupervised time in the living room, door open but private. They had each other, and for now, that was enough.

---

## March 28th - Day Four: The City

They spent their second-to-last day exploring Winnipeg like tourists: Assiniboine Park, the legislature, Osborne Village shops, Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Her parents gave them more space today, trailing farther behind, trusting the boundaries that had been carefully built over months.

"I like your city," Ethan said as they walked through the park, the zoo visible in the distance, ducks on the pond testing the water.

"It's your city too now. If you want it to be."

"I want it to be." He squeezed her hand. "After emancipation, after I'm free—I'm thinking about spending the summer here. Get a job, hang out, exist somewhere other than Massachusetts and my dad's control."

"You could stay with us. My parents already offered."

"I know. I might take them up on it." He stopped walking, turned to face her. "Sophia, when I filed for emancipation, it wasn't just about being with you. It was about becoming who I'm supposed to be. But you're part of that future. The biggest part. I need you to know that."

"I know."

"Do you? Because sometimes I worry you think you're a complication in my life instead of the best part of it."

Sophia touched his face, this boy who'd grown from childhood friend to first love to partner in ways she was still understanding. "You're the best part of mine too. And I don't think we're complications for each other. I think we're amplifications. Making each other more of who we're supposed to be."

"Amplifications." He smiled. "I like that better than entanglement."

"Both work."

They kissed there in the park, supervised from fifty feet away, legal and public and real. Then they kept walking, talking about MIT classes they wanted to take, about whether they'd be in the same dorm or if that was too much too fast, about summer jobs and plans and the space between now and September.

Dinner that night was special—Grace had cooked Sophia's favorite, Michael had gotten fancy dessert, Jordan came over with Maya, and they all crowded around the table like this was normal. Like Ethan had always been part of this group, this family, this constellation of people choosing to care about each other.

"To science fair champions," Jordan said, raising his glass of soda.

"To provincial qualifiers," Maya added.

"To MIT," Michael said.

"To fighting for what matters," Grace finished, looking at Ethan.

They toasted, and Sophia felt the weight of tomorrow—his last day, his six AM flight, the return to distance—pressing against the edges of tonight's joy.

But tonight they had this. Tomorrow could wait.

---

## March 29th - Day Five: The Revelation

His flight was at six AM on Sunday, which meant leaving the house by four-thirty, which meant their last night together was Saturday evening. They sat in her room, door open as required, his packed bag by the door, and time felt elastic and cruel.

"I don't want to go back," Ethan said.

"You have to. Finish school. Graduate. Then you're free."

"Seventy more days until I turn eighteen. Less if emancipation goes through." He pulled an envelope from his jacket pocket. "Before I go, I need to give you this."

Sophia took the envelope. Legal papers again, but different from the emancipation ones. Dated February 20th—the same day he'd filed for emancipation.

"What is this?"

"Open it."

She did. Read the heading. Read it again. Looked up at him in shock.

"You filed for emancipation two months ago."

"I had to. Sophia, I couldn't wait anymore. Couldn't keep living under his control, couldn't keep letting him dictate everything." Ethan's hands shook slightly. "The hearing was supposed to be April 15th. I've been building the case, working with your dad, preparing everything."

"But—"

"But my dad found out. Don't ask me how. He has people, resources. And he called me two hours ago." Ethan's voice hardened. "He moved the hearing up. It's Monday, March 31st. Nine AM. Massachusetts family court. Two days from now."

Sophia's heart stopped. "Two days?"

"He's trying to destabilize me. Catch me unprepared, make me panic, force me to withdraw the petition. But I won't." Ethan met her eyes. "I've been preparing for months. Your dad's been coaching me on what to expect. I have financial plans, academic records, character witnesses. I'm ready."

"But two days—"

"I know. My flight tomorrow, straight to prep school, then to court Monday morning. No time to second-guess, no time to be scared. Just go and win."

Sophia's mind raced. "I want to be there."

"You can't. It's in Massachusetts, and you have school Monday."

"Then I'll watch via video like you did for the restraining order hearing."

"Sophia—"

"Don't 'Sophia' me. You supported me through court, I'm supporting you. That's what partners do." She grabbed his hands. "What happens if you win?"

"I'm legally emancipated. Free to make my own choices. Your parents said I can stay here this summer, work, prepare for MIT. Freedom." His voice shook. "Real freedom. Not waiting until eighteen, not living under his control for three more months. Now."

"And if you lose?"

"Then I wait. July 16th. Seventy days. But I won't lose. I can't." He pulled her closer. "This is it, Sophia. The fight that changes everything. Win this, and we're free. Both of us."

They sat with that, the magnitude of Monday morning settling over them. Two days. Forty-eight hours until a judge decided if a seventeen-year-old boy could declare independence from his father's control.

From downstairs, her mother called up: "It's getting late. Ethan, you should probably get some rest. Four-thirty comes early."

They stood. His bag by the door. Tomorrow at dawn he'd leave, fly back to Massachusetts, walk into court on Monday and fight for himself.

"I'm terrified," Ethan admitted.

"Good. Terror means it matters." Sophia hugged him hard. "You're going to win."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're not asking for something unreasonable. You're asking to be seen as the person you are: smart, capable, ready for independence. Any judge who's paying attention will see that."

"Your dad said the same thing."

"Then believe us."

They went downstairs where her parents were pretending to read but clearly waiting. The goodbye was supervised but gentle—Grace hugging Ethan, Michael shaking his hand and saying something quiet that made Ethan nod seriously.

Then Sophia walked him to the door, the porch light creating a small bubble of privacy while her parents watched from inside.

"Five days wasn't enough," Ethan said.

"It never would have been."

"Call you after the hearing?"

"Immediately after."

"Okay." He kissed her, sweet and desperate and full of promise. "I love you."

"I love you too. Go win your freedom."

"Our freedom."

"Our freedom."

He left, Uber pulling away into the late evening, and Sophia stood on the porch until the taillights disappeared. Inside, her parents waited with tea and comfort, but for a moment she needed to stand in the spring air and feel the weight of what was coming.

Monday. The hearing. Everything changing.

Her phone buzzed: his text from the Uber.

Whatever happens Monday, know that you gave me the courage to fight. Not for you. For me. But you're why I know it's worth it.

She typed back: You've always been worth fighting for. Now go prove it to the judge.

His response: See you on the other side.

---

## Sunday Morning - Goodbye

Four-thirty AM came too early. Sophia stumbled downstairs in pajamas to find Ethan already packed, her father making coffee, the house quiet in that predawn way.

"You didn't have to get up," Ethan said, but he looked relieved that she had.

"Yes I did."

They rode to the airport in silence, Sophia's head on his shoulder, his hand in hers, both of them beyond words. The airport was empty and bright, departures board showing his six AM flight to Boston.

Security line. The point where she couldn't go further.

"This is it," Sophia said.

"For now." Ethan cupped her face. "Monday morning, nine AM. Think of me."

"I will. Every second."

"Win or lose, we're going to be okay."

"We're going to win."

"We're going to win," he agreed.

He kissed her one last time—supervised by her parents twenty feet away, but theirs—and then he was walking through security, showing his ID, disappearing into the airport crowd.

Gone.

Sophia stood at the barrier until she couldn't see him anymore, then turned to her parents. "Take me home?"

"Of course."

In the car, watching Winnipeg wake up around them, she checked her phone. Message from Ethan, sent from security:

On my way to the fight. Thank you for giving me reason to win.

She didn't cry. She'd cried enough these months. Instead she thought about Monday: the hearing, the judge, the moment when everything would change.

And she thought about something else. Something he'd said last night that had been bothering her. About his dad knowing about the emancipation, about moving the hearing up.

How had Robert found out?

The petition was filed. Legal documents. But the hearing wasn't public knowledge until you were served, and Ethan had said Robert wouldn't be served until next week.

So how?

"Dad," Sophia said carefully. "Can Robert Price access court records? About Ethan's emancipation petition?"

Michael glanced at her in the rearview mirror. "Not unless he's specifically looking for them. Or unless someone told him."

"But if he was looking?"

"Then yes. Court filings are public record. If Robert suspected something and searched, he'd find the petition."

"And he could move the hearing up? Just like that?"

"If he has lawyers who request expedited process, and if the judge agrees there's cause, yes. It's unusual but not impossible." Michael's expression darkened. "Why?"

"Because Ethan said Robert moved it up to Monday. The original hearing was April 15th. That's two weeks away. How did Robert know to move it if he wasn't served yet?"

Her parents exchanged a look.

"Maybe Ethan told someone," Grace suggested. "A friend, a teacher—"

"He didn't. He kept it secret. Only me, you two, and Jordan knew." Sophia's mind raced. "Robert has people. Resources. Maybe he had someone watching for filings. Maybe he pays attention to court records."

"Maybe," Michael said, but he didn't sound convinced.

They drove the rest of the way in silence, and Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. That Robert moving the hearing wasn't just strategy. That Monday morning was going to be more complicated than any of them expected.

But Ethan was prepared. He had to be. He'd been working on this for months.

Monday would prove it.

Monday would change everything.

---

## Sunday Evening - The Call

Sophia's phone rang at eight PM: Ethan, calling from his prep school dorm.

"Hey," she said. "You okay?"

"I'm okay. Tired. Nervous. Can't sleep."

"That's why you called?"

"I called because tomorrow everything changes and I wanted to hear your voice." He paused. "Sophia, if I win—when I win—I'm free. Legally free to choose where I live, what I do, who I'm with. No more restraining orders, no more supervision requirements because there's no parent to require them. Just us, making our own decisions."

"That's what we want."

"I know. But it's huge. It's me basically telling my dad that I'm done being his son in any legal sense. He won't forgive that."

"Do you care?"

Silence. Then: "No. I don't. And that's what scares me. That I've gotten to a place where I don't care if he forgives me. I just want to be free from him."

"That's not scary. That's healthy."

"Maybe." He yawned. "I should sleep. Court's at nine. Your dad said dress professionally, speak clearly, don't get defensive. I have his notes memorized."

"You're going to be brilliant."

"I'm going to try." Another pause. "I love you."

"I love you too. Call me the second it's over."

"The second."

They hung up, and Sophia sat in her room staring at Monday's date on her calendar. March 31st. The hearing. The fight. The moment when a seventeen-year-old boy would stand in front of a judge and ask for freedom.

And somewhere in Massachusetts, Robert Price was planning his counter-attack.

---

## Monday Morning - The Crisis

Sophia was in first period English when her phone buzzed. She wasn't supposed to check it during class, but something made her glance down.

ETHAN: Hearing in 30 minutes. I'm terrified but ready.

She typed back quickly: You've got this. Call me after.

His response: I will. Whatever happens.

The class dragged. Every minute felt like ten, every page of *The Great Gatsby* they were supposed to be discussing felt meaningless compared to what was happening in Massachusetts right now. At nine AM Winnipeg time—ten AM Eastern—Ethan would walk into court.

At 9:47 AM, her phone buzzed again.

JORDAN: Have you heard from Ethan?

SOPHIA: Not since before the hearing. Why?

JORDAN: Something's wrong. My mom's been on the phone with Robert for 20 minutes. She sounds panicked.

Sophia's stomach dropped. She raised her hand. "Can I use the bathroom?"

In the hallway, she called Ethan. Straight to voicemail.

Called again. Voicemail.

Texted: What's happening? Are you okay?

No response.

She was about to go back to class when her phone rang: Michael.

"Dad? What—"

"I just got a call from the Massachusetts family court. The hearing's been delayed." Her father's voice was tight with anger. "Robert filed a counter-motion this morning. Emergency petition for psychiatric evaluation. He's claiming Ethan's not mentally competent to request emancipation."

Sophia felt the world tilt. "He's what?"

"It's a stall tactic. The judge has to review the motion before proceeding with the emancipation hearing. It could push everything back weeks."

"But Ethan's there. Right now. Ready to testify."

"I know. I'm trying to reach him." Michael paused. "Sophia, this is bad. This is Robert using every weapon he has. The hearing won't happen today. Maybe not this week. And every day it's delayed is another day Ethan's under his control."

"Can he do that? Just claim Ethan's mentally unfit?"

"He can claim anything. Whether it holds up is different. But the process—evaluations, assessments, reviews—that takes time."

Sophia leaned against the hallway lockers, feeling everything they'd built toward crashing down. "What do we do?"

"We wait. We support him. And we let him know he's not alone."

"I need to talk to him."

"I'll call you when I know more."

Her father hung up, and Sophia stood in the empty hallway trying to process. Robert had found out about the emancipation, had moved the hearing up to catch Ethan off-guard, and now was blocking it entirely with claims of mental incompetence.

This wasn't just controlling. This was warfare.

Her phone buzzed: Ethan, finally.

ETHAN: The hearing's canceled. My dad filed emergency motion. Claims I'm not stable enough to make this decision. The judge has to review it before we can proceed.

SOPHIA: I know. My dad called. Are you okay?

ETHAN: No. I'm sitting in the courthouse and everything I've worked for just got destroyed. He won't let me go. He'll never let me go.

SOPHIA: He doesn't have a choice. You turn eighteen in July. That's 108 days. He can delay this hearing but he can't stop time.

ETHAN: 108 days under his control. 108 more days of him winning.

SOPHIA: He's not winning. He's desperate. Desperate people make mistakes.

No response for three minutes. Then:

ETHAN: I have to go. His lawyers want to talk. I'll call you tonight.

SOPHIA: I love you. This isn't over.

ETHAN: It feels over.

SOPHIA: It's not. We're not. Call me tonight.

But he didn't call that night. Or the next day. Or the next.

And when Sophia finally got through to him on Wednesday, his voice was flat and distant and wrong.

"He's moving me," Ethan said. "Withdrawing me from prep school. I'm going home to Massachusetts, living with him, finishing junior year online. He says it's to 'support me through this difficult time.' Really it's to isolate me. Control what I see, who I talk to, what I do."

"He can't—"

"He can. I'm still seventeen. Still legally his son. Still under his authority until I turn eighteen or until emancipation goes through. And he's made sure emancipation won't happen anytime soon."

Sophia felt everything fracturing. "When do you move?"

"This weekend. Saturday."

"Can I call you? Can we—"

"He's monitoring everything. Phone, email, all of it. Says it's for my own good." Ethan laughed, bitter. "I'm back to square one. Worse than square one. At least at prep school I had some distance."

"The judge has to rule on the psychiatric evaluation motion. She'll see it's bullshit."

"Maybe. Eventually. But 'eventually' means weeks, maybe months. And every day that passes is another day I'm trapped."

"July 16th," Sophia said desperately. "That's the hard deadline. He can't stop you from turning eighteen."

"107 days." Ethan's voice cracked. "I don't know if I can do 107 more days."

"You can. We can." Sophia was crying now, couldn't help it. "Ethan, don't let him break you. That's what he wants. He wants you to give up, accept his control, stop fighting. Don't give him that."

"I'm so tired."

"I know. But you're stronger than him. You've always been stronger than him. This is just another battle."

Silence. Then: "I have to go. He's calling me for dinner. Some family meeting about my 'mental health' and 'concerning decisions.' I'll try to call you this weekend before I move. But if I can't—"

"Don't say goodbye."

"If I can't, know that I love you. Know that this isn't over. Know that I'll find a way back."

"You don't have to find a way back. I'll come to you."

"Sophia—"

"I mean it. If he tries to keep you isolated, I'll fight. We'll both fight. Together."

"Together," he repeated, and some of the flatness left his voice. "Okay. Together."

They hung up, and Sophia sat in her room staring at the MIT acceptance letter on her wall, the science fair trophy on her desk, the evidence of partnership that Robert Price was trying to destroy.

107 days until Ethan turned eighteen.

107 days until freedom.

But first, they had to survive.

And Robert Price was just getting started.
