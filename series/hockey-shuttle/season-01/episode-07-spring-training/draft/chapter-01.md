# CHAPTER 1: THE HEARING

## Monday, February 17th - Winnipeg Law Courts Complex

The courthouse steps were concrete and salt-stained, winter refusing to release its grip on Winnipeg even as mid-February pushed toward March. Sophia stood between her parents, watching her breath cloud in the minus-fifteen air, and tried to remember how to be brave.

Eight weeks. Fifty-six days since she'd last seen Ethan in person, since that awful night at the hotel when everything shattered. Fifty-six days of silence enforced by legal documents, of her phone feeling like a dead thing in her pocket, of sleeping with his Concordia Hockey hoodie because it still smelled like him. Fifty-six days of wondering if fighting was pointless, if Robert Price's money and lawyers and control would simply win because that's how the world worked.

But her father—quiet, careful Professor Michael Chen who taught contract law at the University of Manitoba and had never represented anyone in court before—squeezed her shoulder and said, "Ready?"

And because she had to be, Sophia nodded.

The courthouse loomed above them, all brown brick and narrow windows, justice contained in something that looked more like a prison than hope. Media vans lined the street—someone had leaked the hearing, probably Robert's team, making it public to shame them—and Sophia felt the weight of cameras even though none were pointed their way yet. This was what Robert wanted: exposure, humiliation, control.

"Ignore them," her mother said, Grace Chen in her best suit, her hand finding Sophia's. "We walk in together. We walk out together."

Three figures emerged from a black town car at the curb: expensive suits, leather briefcases, the kind of polished that came from charging four hundred dollars an hour. Robert Price's lawyers. Sophia had researched them after Michael showed her the court filings. Gerald Whitmore, senior partner at Whitmore & Associates, who specialized in family law and had a reputation for destroying opposing counsel. His two associates flanked him like bodyguards.

They didn't look at Sophia's family. They walked past like wind, trailing expensive cologne and certainty.

"He's not here," Sophia said, scanning the steps. "Robert."

"He doesn't need to be," Michael said. "He sent his weapons."

Her father carried a single briefcase, worn leather that he'd had since graduate school. Against Whitmore's team, he looked like someone who'd brought a stick to a gunfight. But when Sophia had asked him why he was doing this—taking a case he had no experience with, going pro bono against one of the most expensive firms in Winnipeg—he'd said: "Because someone needs to, and because you showed me what courage looks like. Now let me show you what the law can do when it's on your side."

They climbed the steps. Sophia's legs felt distant, her body moving on automation while her mind raced ahead to the courtroom, to what she'd have to say, to Ethan testifying via video from Massachusetts. To the judge who would decide if love was allowed or forbidden.

The security line moved slowly. Metal detector, bag check, the mundane machinery of justice grinding forward. A reporter approached—"Miss Chen, do you have any comment about—"—but Michael stepped between them smoothly.

"My client has no statement. Please respect the process."

My client. Her dad was her lawyer. The strangeness of it struck her again.

They rode the elevator to the fourth floor in silence. The hallway smelled like floor polish and anxiety. Courtroom 4C waited at the end, door closed, a bench outside where a teenage boy sat scrolling his phone, clearly here for something else entirely. He looked up as they passed, did a double-take like maybe he recognized Sophia from Instagram, then went back to his screen.

Famous for all the wrong reasons now.

Michael checked his watch. "We're early. Good. Judge Morrison doesn't like tardiness."

"What's she like?" Sophia asked. "The judge?"

"Fair. Smart. Doesn't suffer manipulation." Michael met her eyes. "Which works in our favor. Just tell the truth. That's all you need to do."

The truth. Sophia had spent eight weeks thinking about truth, about what it meant when two people loved each other but the world said they shouldn't, when every choice was complicated by age and history and parents who couldn't see past their own fears. The truth was that she loved Ethan Price, had loved him since they were nine years old skating at the same rink, had found him again and decided that some things were worth fighting for even when fighting meant pain. The truth was that she'd chosen MIT before she'd chosen him, that her academic excellence had nothing to do with his influence and everything to do with who she'd always been. The truth was that Robert Price had filed this restraining order not to protect his son but to control him, and that control dressed up as love was still just control.

But could she say all that to a judge?

The courtroom door opened. Gerald Whitmore emerged, phone to his ear, speaking in low tones. He ended the call and glanced at them—a flick of assessment, nothing more—then walked past to the water fountain.

Michael lowered his voice. "He'll try to make you seem manipulative. Older, experienced, seducing an innocent boy. He'll use the hotel against you, the Instagram post, anything he can twist. Don't let him bait you. Answer the questions directly, stay calm, remember you're not on trial."

"But I am," Sophia said. "That's exactly what this is."

Her mother's hand tightened on her shoulder. "You're not the one who should be."

The bailiff appeared in the doorway—a woman in uniform, clipboard in hand. "Chen versus Price? We're ready for you."

This was it. The moment that would determine if the next months were supervision and structure or complete silence until Ethan turned eighteen in July. The moment that would prove if the system could see past money and manipulation to what was real.

Sophia's phone buzzed in her pocket—one last message before they had to turn them off for court. She checked it quickly.

JORDAN: He's logged into the court feed. Watching everything. You've got this. Be the badass I know you are.

She smiled despite everything. Jordan Chen-Ward, her cousin, Ethan's best friend, the bridge between their separated worlds. Knowing Jordan was with him, that Ethan wasn't alone, helped.

They walked into Courtroom 4C.

---

The room was smaller than she'd imagined. Television courtrooms were grand, dramatic, built for cameras. This was functional: wood paneling, fluorescent lights, that particular silence that came from serious decisions being made. The judge's bench loomed at the front, empty for now. The witness stand to the left. Gallery seating behind a low barrier, mostly empty except for a court reporter and what looked like a law student with a notebook.

Whitmore and his associates sat at the respondent's table, documents arranged in neat stacks, everything choreographed and precise. Michael led them to the applicant's table—smaller, less polished, but theirs. Sophia sat between her parents, Michael arranging his papers, and felt the weight of what was about to happen settle over her like snow.

"All rise."

They stood. Judge Karen Morrison entered from her chambers, robes flowing, a woman in her fifties with sharp eyes and silver hair pulled back severely. She took her seat, and they sat.

"This is a hearing regarding the restraining order filed on behalf of Ethan David Price, minor, by his father and legal guardian Robert Price," Judge Morrison said, her voice carrying easily in the small space. "We're here to review the conditions of that order and determine if modifications are warranted. Mr. Whitmore, you're representing the respondent?"

Whitmore rose smoothly. "Yes, Your Honor. Gerald Whitmore for Robert Price, acting in his capacity as legal guardian for his son, aged seventeen."

"And for the applicant?"

Michael stood, and Sophia heard the slight tremor in his voice before he controlled it. "Michael Chen, Your Honor. I'm representing my daughter, Sophia Chen, and by extension the interests of Ethan Price in this matter."

Judge Morrison's eyebrow rose slightly. "You're representing your own daughter, Professor Chen?"

"I am. Pro bono, and with full disclosure of the relationship. Miss Chen is financially unable to afford representation, and I believe my expertise in contract and family law qualifies me despite the personal connection."

"I'll allow it, but I expect professional conduct." Her gaze swept them both. "Gentlemen, I've reviewed the filings from both sides. Mr. Whitmore, your client filed this restraining order on December 23rd citing concerns about an inappropriate relationship between his minor son and Miss Chen. The order currently prohibits any contact between the two parties. Today we're reviewing that order to determine if it should stand, be modified, or be dissolved. Present your case."

Whitmore rose again, and Sophia watched him transform into the lawyer Robert's money had bought: confident, authoritative, righteous.

"Your Honor, this case concerns the safety and wellbeing of a seventeen-year-old boy who has been manipulated by someone who should have known better. Miss Chen is eighteen, legally an adult, and has engaged in a relationship with my client's son that began when he was sixteen. She has influenced his academic choices, his social life, his relationship with his family. On December 21st, the two were discovered in a hotel room together—a clear escalation that prompted Mr. Price to take legal action to protect his son."

Sophia's jaw tightened. Manipulated. Influenced. As if Ethan had no agency, no thoughts of his own.

"Mr. Price has attempted multiple times to address this situation privately," Whitmore continued. "He's spoken with his son, with Miss Chen, with her parents. But the relationship continued, becoming increasingly concerning. The hotel incident was the final straw. Mr. Price seeks to maintain the restraining order until his son turns eighteen and can make adult decisions without being unduly influenced by someone who has demonstrated poor judgment."

He sat down, and the words hung in the air. Poor judgment. That's what love was to them.

Judge Morrison turned. "Professor Chen?"

Michael stood, and this time his voice was steady. "Your Honor, this isn't about protection. It's about control. My daughter and Ethan Price have known each other since childhood. They trained at the same hockey rink when they were nine years old, before Ethan's family moved to Massachusetts. They reconnected two years ago when we moved to the same city. Their relationship developed naturally, between two young people of similar age who share intellectual interests and mutual respect."

He opened his briefcase, pulling out documents. "I've submitted Miss Chen's academic records, Your Honor. She's ranked first in her class. She was accepted early action to MIT—before this relationship intensified—based on her own merit. She's a competitive badminton player, a science fair finalist, a young woman with clear goals and strong character. The suggestion that she's some kind of manipulator is not only false, it's insulting to both her and Ethan."

Judge Morrison glanced at the documents. "The hotel incident, Professor Chen. How do you address that?"

"Two teenagers who cared about each other wanted to spend time together away from parental oversight. Poor judgment? Perhaps. Illegal? No. They're both minors, only fifteen months apart in age. There was no coercion, no manipulation. Just two young people making a mistake that any teenagers might make."

"They lied to their parents about their whereabouts," Whitmore interjected. "That demonstrates deception—"

"Teenagers lie to their parents," Michael said flatly. "That's not a legal issue, it's a parenting one. And when Mr. Price discovered the situation, his response was not to talk with his son or address the issue within the family. It was to file a restraining order designed to isolate and control."

Judge Morrison held up a hand. "I'm more interested in hearing from the parties themselves than from counsel. Mr. Whitmore, I understand Ethan Price is unable to attend in person?"

"He's completing his junior year at a boarding school in Massachusetts, Your Honor. However, he's available via video conference if the court wishes to hear from him."

"I do." Judge Morrison nodded to the bailiff. "Let's set up the video call."

Sophia's heart hammered. She was going to see him. After eight weeks of nothing, she was about to see his face on a screen in a courtroom while a judge decided their fate.

The bailiff wheeled in a large monitor, fumbling with cables and connections. It took three minutes that felt like hours, technical difficulties in the middle of everything. Then the screen flickered to life, and there he was.

Ethan.

He looked different. Thinner, his face harder somehow, the softness she remembered from Christmas gone. His hair was shorter, more controlled. He wore a button-down shirt and tie, clearly dressed for court, and sat in what looked like a conference room at his school. But his eyes—God, his eyes were the same. Dark and intense and locked on the camera like he could see through it to her.

She couldn't wave, couldn't smile, couldn't do anything but sit frozen while her heart broke and healed simultaneously.

"Mr. Price," Judge Morrison said. "Thank you for joining us. I understand you've been separated from Miss Chen for approximately eight weeks under the terms of your father's restraining order. How has that been for you?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Difficult, Your Honor."

"Your father filed this order out of concern for your wellbeing. Do you believe that concern is justified?"

"No." The word was firm, clear. "My father doesn't like that I'm making choices he disagrees with. The restraining order isn't about protecting me. It's about controlling who I spend time with and what I care about."

Whitmore shifted forward. "Your Honor, if I may—"

"You may not. I'm speaking with the young man." Judge Morrison's attention didn't waver from the screen. "Mr. Price, you're seventeen years old, is that correct?"

"Yes, Your Honor."

"In a few months you'll be eighteen and legally able to make your own decisions. Your father's concern seems to be that Miss Chen has undue influence over you. What's your response to that?"

Ethan was quiet for a moment, and Sophia watched him gather his thoughts the way he did before answering hard questions. Careful, methodical, honest.

"Sophia didn't influence me, Your Honor. She inspired me. There's a difference."

The courtroom went very still.

"I've been playing hockey since I was five years old," Ethan continued. "It's what my father wanted, what he trained me for, what our whole life has been built around. I'm good at it. I might even get college scholarships for it. But I've never been sure it's what I want."

He leaned forward slightly, and Sophia could see the passion in his face, the thing that had drawn her to him from the beginning: his hunger to be more than what people expected.

"Sophia reminded me that I'm good at other things too. Science. Math. Problem-solving. When I'm with her, I remember that I used to love learning, that there's more to life than hockey and my father's expectations. She didn't manipulate me into choosing MIT. She showed me it was possible to want something different."

Judge Morrison made a note. "And the hotel incident on December 21st? That's what prompted this order. Can you explain what happened?"

Sophia watched him take a breath, saw the teenager warring with the person trying to be adult enough for court.

"We wanted to spend time together. Alone. My father had made it clear he didn't approve of Sophia, and her parents were trying to set boundaries that felt impossible. We made a bad decision. We lied about where we'd be, we got a hotel room, we thought we could have a few hours without everyone watching us." He paused. "We didn't do anything illegal. We just wanted to be together without the world having an opinion about it."

"Do you regret that decision?"

"I regret lying to our parents. I regret that it gave my father ammunition to do this." Ethan's voice hardened. "I don't regret wanting to spend time with someone I care about."

"You care about Miss Chen?"

"I love her."

Three words, said clearly and without hesitation. Sophia felt tears prick her eyes and blinked them back hard. Not here. Not in front of the judge and the lawyers and her parents and the court reporter transcribing everything.

"Your Honor," Whitmore said, standing now. "This is exactly the kind of emotional manipulation—"

"I don't see manipulation, Mr. Whitmore. I see two young people who have strong feelings for each other." Judge Morrison turned back to the screen. "Mr. Price, do you feel that Miss Chen has pressured you in any way? Made you feel obligated to her?"

"No. Sophia's the least manipulative person I know. She's always telling me to make my own choices, to figure out what I want. If anything, she pushes me to think independently." He smiled slightly, sadly. "That's probably why my father doesn't like her. She makes it harder for him to tell me what to do."

"And if this restraining order is modified to allow supervised contact, will you be able to respect those boundaries?"

"Yes, Your Honor. I just want to be able to talk to her. See her. Not be cut off completely for choosing to care about someone."

Judge Morrison nodded. "Thank you, Mr. Price. Please stay on the line. I'd like to hear from Miss Chen now."

The camera angle didn't shift, but Sophia knew Ethan could see the courtroom, could see her at the table between her parents. Their eyes met through the screen—across fifteen hundred miles and eight weeks of silence—and something passed between them that needed no words.

We're still here. We're still us.

"Miss Chen, please take the stand."

Sophia stood on legs that felt borrowed. Her mother squeezed her hand once—you've got this—and then she was walking to the witness stand, sitting in the chair where people swore to tell the truth, facing a judge who would decide if love was allowed.

The court reporter reminded her she was still under oath from the initial filing. Sophia nodded.

Judge Morrison studied her for a long moment. "Miss Chen, you're eighteen years old?"

"Yes, Your Honor. I turned eighteen in September."

"And you're currently a senior in high school?"

"Yes. I'm graduating in June."

"I've reviewed your academic record. It's impressive. MIT early action acceptance, ranked first in your class, competitive badminton player. You seem like a young woman with clear goals and strong discipline. How does your relationship with Ethan Price fit into that picture?"

Sophia chose her words carefully. "Ethan and I have similar goals. We both want to study STEM fields, we both care about academic excellence, we both push each other to be better. Being with him doesn't distract me from my goals. It motivates me to achieve them."

"But you lied to your parents to spend time with him. You made choices that showed poor judgment, as your own father admitted. Doesn't that suggest the relationship is problematic?"

"It suggests we're teenagers who made a mistake," Sophia said. "Not that we're bad for each other."

"Mr. Price's father believes you have undue influence over his son. That you've manipulated him away from hockey, away from his family. How do you respond to that?"

This was the moment. The question she'd been dreading and preparing for in equal measure. Sophia met the judge's eyes and told the truth.

"I didn't manipulate Ethan into anything. I've never asked him to choose between hockey and academics. I've never said a bad word about his father. What I did do is show him that he's allowed to want more than one thing, that being good at hockey doesn't mean he has to sacrifice every other interest." She paused. "Ethan is brilliant. He's curious and thoughtful and capable of so much more than anyone gives him credit for. His father sees him as a hockey player, as someone to mold into what he wants. I see him as a person who gets to decide for himself."

"And what is it you want from this hearing, Miss Chen?"

The question hung in the air. What did she want? She wanted the last eight weeks erased, the pain and silence and separation undone. She wanted Robert Price to stop trying to control his son. She wanted to hold Ethan's hand and walk through The Forks and talk about college and futures without lawyers and restraining orders and judges deciding if they were allowed to exist in each other's lives.

But what she said was: "I want permission to talk to him. To email, to call, to see him when he visits Winnipeg. Supervised if that's what's required. I just don't want to be cut off completely for caring about someone."

Judge Morrison made more notes, her face unreadable. "Thank you, Miss Chen. You may step down."

Sophia returned to her seat, her legs shaking now that the adrenaline was fading. Her father gave her a small nod—well done—but she couldn't tell if it had been enough.

"I'd like to hear from the parents," Judge Morrison said. "Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen, you've been somewhat caught in the middle of this situation. What's your position on the relationship between your daughter and Mr. Price?"

Michael and Grace exchanged a look, some silent communication passing between them. Her mother spoke first.

"We were concerned initially," Grace said. "The age difference, the intensity, the way it seemed to accelerate quickly. We set boundaries that Sophia violated when she went to that hotel. We were angry and scared."

"But?" Judge Morrison prompted.

"But over the past eight weeks, we've watched our daughter handle this with maturity we didn't expect. She hasn't fallen apart. She hasn't let her grades slip or her athletic performance suffer. She's maintained her friendships, her responsibilities, her goals. And when we really looked at the relationship without our fear clouding it, we saw that Ethan treats her with respect. He supports her ambitions. He makes her happy." Grace's voice strengthened. "Robert Price may not approve of our daughter, but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with her or with how she and Ethan feel about each other."

"Professor Chen?"

Michael leaned forward. "Your Honor, I'm a law professor. I teach about contracts and family law and the systems meant to protect people. When Robert Price filed this restraining order, I was furious. Not because of the relationship—because of the misuse of the legal system. This order isn't about protection. It's about a parent weaponizing the courts to control his child. That's not what restraining orders are for."

"Strong words," Judge Morrison said.

"Strong feelings. I've spent eight weeks watching my daughter hurt because a grown man decided to punish her for his son's choices. I've represented her pro bono because someone needs to stand up to that. If the court allows this order to stand as written, it sends a message that parents can isolate their children from anyone they disapprove of, regardless of the merit of that disapproval."

Whitmore stood. "Your Honor, Mr. Price is exercising his legal rights as a parent—"

"I'm aware of parental rights, Mr. Whitmore." Judge Morrison's tone was cool. "I'm also aware that seventeen-year-olds are not property, and that restraining orders are not parenting tools. Sit down."

Whitmore sat, his professional mask slipping for just a moment to show irritation.

Judge Morrison reviewed her notes, the silence stretching. Sophia's heart hammered. On the screen, Ethan sat frozen, waiting. In the gallery, the law student scribbled frantically, probably getting material for some paper on family law and judicial discretion.

Finally, the judge spoke.

"I've heard enough to make a determination. First, let me be clear about what this case is and is not about. This is not about whether two teenagers should be dating. That's a parenting issue, not a legal one. This is about whether a restraining order—a legal tool designed to protect people from harm—is being used appropriately."

She turned to Whitmore. "Mr. Whitmore, I understand your client's concerns. As a father, he's entitled to have opinions about his son's relationships. As a parent, he can set rules and boundaries. But a restraining order requires demonstrating harm or threat of harm. Your filings allege manipulation and inappropriate influence, but the evidence doesn't support that. Both parties are minors only fifteen months apart. Both are academically excellent. Both have goals and plans that don't depend on each other. The hotel incident shows poor judgment, not predatory behavior."

Sophia barely breathed.

"Miss Chen, your academic record speaks for itself. You were accepted to MIT before this relationship intensified, which undermines the claim that Mr. Price has influenced your choices. The reverse claim—that you've manipulated him—similarly falls flat. Mr. Price's own testimony makes clear he's making independent decisions."

Judge Morrison closed the file in front of her. "Therefore, I'm modifying the restraining order as follows: Contact between Sophia Chen and Ethan Price is permitted under these conditions. One, email communication is allowed, with the understanding that Mr. Chen and Mr. Price senior have the right to review such communication. Two, phone calls are permitted on a weekly basis, supervised by parents or designated guardians. Three, in-person contact is permitted when Mr. Price is in Winnipeg, supervised by appropriate adults. Four, all parties will document contact and maintain appropriate boundaries. Five, this arrangement will be reviewed in sixty days to assess compliance."

She looked at the screen. "Mr. Price, you have a spring break coming up in March, I believe?"

"Yes, Your Honor. March 25th through 29th."

"If you wish to visit Winnipeg during that time, you may do so. You'll stay with the Chen family or other appropriate accommodations, not in hotels alone with Miss Chen. Supervised activities are permitted. Do you understand these conditions?"

"Yes, Your Honor."

"Miss Chen, do you understand and agree to these conditions?"

"Yes, Your Honor." Sophia's voice cracked slightly, relief flooding through her so fast it was almost painful.

"Mr. Whitmore, your client has the right to appeal this decision, but I'm putting you on notice: if Mr. Price attempts to use the legal system to further control his son rather than addressing this as a family matter, I will not look favorably on future filings. Parents have rights, but so do their children. Dismissed."

The gavel came down.

For a moment, nobody moved. Then Whitmore was gathering his papers with sharp, angry movements, the law student was closing his notebook, the bailiff was shutting down the video equipment. On the screen, Ethan's image froze for a second before the connection cut out.

And Sophia was standing, her parents beside her, Michael's hand on her shoulder, her mother hugging her hard, the reality crashing over her in waves:

They'd won.

Not everything. Not complete freedom. But something. Permission. Structure. A path forward.

"Come on," Michael said quietly. "Let's go before the media catches us."

They gathered their things quickly and headed for the side exit, avoiding the main doors where cameras waited. The hallway was empty except for a janitor buffing the floors. They took the stairs instead of the elevator, flight after flight, emergency exit signs glowing green in the dimness.

Outside, the cold hit like a wall, but Sophia barely felt it. Her phone—she'd turned it off for court—buzzed to life with notifications. Messages flooding in.

JORDAN: She modified it! You can talk!

MAYA: Checking news sites. Did you win?

And one from an unknown number that could only be him:

Outside. Call me when you can.

Her hands shook as she looked at her parents. "Can I—"

"Yes," her mother said immediately. "Call him."

Sophia's fingers fumbled on the screen, finding the number, pressing call. It rang once.

"Sophia."

His voice. His actual voice after fifty-six days of silence, of phantom texts she couldn't send, of things she'd saved up to tell him that piled up like snow until she thought she'd suffocate under the weight of everything she couldn't say.

She tried to answer and couldn't. Her throat closed completely, eight weeks of holding it together dissolving all at once. She heard herself make a sound—half sob, half laugh—utterly undignified and completely real.

"Sophia? Are you there?"

"I can't—" She pressed her hand over her mouth, fighting for control and losing. "I can't talk. I'm trying. I just—"

"Breathe. Just breathe. I'm here."

And somehow that made it worse, the kindness in his voice after so much silence. She bent forward, phone pressed to her ear, crying so hard her mother's hand found her shoulder, steadying.

"I'm okay," she managed finally, voice wrecked. "I'm so okay. Are you?"

"I heard everything. Watched the whole thing. You were incredible. When you said that thing about me being allowed to want more than one thing—" He broke off, and she could hear that he was crying too. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry my father put you through this."

"It's not your fault."

"It's his, but it hurts you. That makes it mine too."

Her parents had walked a few steps away, giving her space but still within supervision parameters. Michael was on his own phone, probably updating Jordan. Grace watched the parking lot, sentinel against media intrusion.

"Spring break," Sophia said. "March 25th. Thirty-six days."

"I'll be there. I'm buying the ticket tonight."

"You'll stay here. My parents said yes. Supervised, but together."

"Together." He laughed, the sound ragged. "I didn't think I'd hear your voice today. I thought the judge would deny everything and we'd be back to silence."

"She saw through it. Your testimony—Ethan, when you said you loved me—"

"I meant it. I'll say it every day if you need to hear it."

"I need to hear it."

"I love you, Sophia Chen. I love you, and thirty-six days from now I'm going to say it to your face."

She was crying now, couldn't help it. Relief and exhaustion and hope tangling together until she couldn't separate them. "I love you too."

"I have to go. My dean is waiting to debrief me about missing class for court. But I'll email you tonight. For real, legally, no hiding."

"Tonight."

"Thirty-six days."

"Thirty-six days."

He hung up, and Sophia stood in the parking lot of the Winnipeg Law Courts Complex, phone pressed to her chest, crying in the February cold while her parents watched and waited.

They'd won. Not perfectly, not completely, but enough.

Enough to build on.

Enough to hope.

Her father approached, gentle. "Ready to go home?"

Home. Where she could email Ethan without deleting the history afterward. Where they could have supervised calls in the basement. Where in thirty-six days he'd walk through the door and stay for five whole days.

"Yeah," Sophia said. "I'm ready."

They walked to the car together, and overhead, the grey February sky seemed just a little less heavy than it had that morning. Spring was coming. Slowly, grudgingly, through winter's grip.

But it was coming.

And so was he.
