# CHAPTER 3: ACCEPTANCE

## March 15th - The MIT Letter

The envelope was thick. Everyone said that meant yes—thin meant rejection, thick meant acceptance—but Sophia stared at the MIT seal for a full minute before opening it because what if everyone was wrong? What if this was a particularly detailed rejection? What if she'd somehow misread the early action acceptance and this was them saying actually, never mind, you're not good enough after all?

Her hands shook as she slid her finger under the flap.

*Dear Sophia Chen,*

*Congratulations! It is with great pleasure that we offer you admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Class of 2028...*

The words blurred. She read them again. Then again. Then she was screaming, couldn't help it, pure joy erupting from somewhere deep and primal and years in the making.

Her mother crashed into her room. "What? What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong!" Sophia thrust the letter at her. "I got in! MIT! I actually got in!"

Grace read the letter, and her face transformed from panic to pride so fast it was almost funny. "Oh sweetheart. Of course you got in. Of course you did."

"I need to call—" Sophia stopped. She'd been about to say "Ethan" automatically, but calling him meant supervised, meant her parents listening, meant waiting until the Wednesday evening slot. But then—wait. "Can I email him? Right now?"

"Yes. Go. Email your boyfriend. Tell him." Grace hugged her hard. "We're so proud of you. You know that, right? Everything else aside—the restraining order, the court stuff, all of it—you did this. Your work, your brain, your excellence. Nobody gave you this."

Sophia nodded, throat tight, and grabbed her laptop.

**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** I GOT IN

ETHAN.

MIT.

FULL ACCEPTANCE.

CLASS OF 2028.

I'M SCREAMING.

Did you hear back yet???

—S (who is apparently going to MIT!!!)

She hit send and then couldn't sit still. She paced her room, checked email obsessively, refreshed the page, checked her phone, came back to her laptop—

And there it was. Six minutes later but feeling like six hours. Subject line: **Checking mail right now**

She opened it with shaking hands:

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** RE: I GOT IN

Checking mail right now.

Hold on.

Sophia stared at those two words, heart hammering. He was opening his letter. Right now. Finding out if they'd both—if this was real—if they could actually—

Her inbox refreshed.

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** WE GOT IN

SOPHIA.

I'M IN.

CLASS OF 2028.

BOTH OF US.

WE'RE GOING TO MIT.

Call me RIGHT NOW. I don't care about supervision. This is emergency levels of good news.

—E (who is also apparently going to MIT!!!)

She was already running downstairs, phone in one hand, his email still open on her laptop behind her. Her parents were hovering in the kitchen, her father having materialized from his home office.

"He got in," Sophia said, and her voice came out high and breathless. "Ethan got into MIT too. We both got in. Can he call? Right now?"

Michael and Grace exchanged one of their wordless parent looks. Her mother's eyes were wet.

"Call him," her father said. "Go. We'll give you space."

Sophia was already dialing, bolting back upstairs, door left open as required but her parents staying downstairs. He answered before it fully rang.

"WE DID IT!" They said it simultaneously, talking over each other, and then they were both laughing—that kind of relief-laughter that comes after months of pressure, the sound of two people who'd been told they were bad for each other getting dual acceptance to one of the best schools in the world.

"I can't believe—"

"Both of us—"

"Same school—"

"Together—"

Sophia collapsed on her bed, MIT letter still clutched in her hand, and felt something release in her chest. Joy. Pure, uncomplicated joy she hadn't let herself feel fully in months because everything had been so hard, so controlled, so supervised.

"Sophia?" Ethan's voice gentled. "You okay?"

"I'm so okay." She pressed her hand over her mouth, fighting happy tears and losing. "I'm just—you got in. We both got in. And nobody can say—"

"Nobody can say anything," he finished. "You applied early action. November. Before we were really us. Before my dad lost his mind. You chose MIT because it was your dream school, not because of me."

"And you got in on your own merit. Not because I influenced you or distracted you or made you worse." Her voice cracked. "We did this separately. We earned this."

"And now we get to do it together." He was quiet for a moment, and she heard him breathing, heard the emotion he was holding back. "They said we were bad for each other. Distraction and poor decisions and choosing each other over everything important. But we both got into MIT, Sophia. We're both going to one of the best schools in the world. Because being together doesn't make us less. It makes us—"

"Better," she whispered. "It makes us better."

"Yeah. It does."

They were quiet for a moment, just breathing across the connection, the weight of vindication settling over both of them. Her parents had been afraid she'd sacrifice her future for him. His father had said she was destroying his potential. And they'd both just proven everyone wrong.

"I'm crying," Sophia admitted. "Happy crying. Is that ridiculous?"

"I'm crying too. Also happy. Also ridiculous." He laughed, wet and genuine. "We're really doing this. College. Massachusetts. Together."

"If that's what you want."

"It's what I want. You're what I want. Every time, I'm choosing you."

Sophia's throat tightened. "Eleven days until you're here."

"Eleven days until I can say this to your face."

They talked for an hour—about MIT, about course catalogs already being planned, about living situations and whether they'd be in the same dorm or if that was even allowed or advisable. About how to tell people, what to tell Robert, whether this made spring break more urgent or more precious.

When they hung up, Sophia found her parents in the kitchen making celebratory dinner even though it was only four PM. Her father was attempting to cook something complicated, her mother supervising with barely concealed amusement.

"MIT," Michael said, looking up from whatever recipe he was butchering. "My daughter is going to MIT."

"We're going to need a bigger celebration than this," Grace said. "Sophia, call Jordan and Maya. Tell them dinner here, six PM, we're celebrating."

"Ethan got in too," Sophia said. "We both did."

"Of course he did." Michael returned to his cooking. "You don't fall in love with stupid people. Even when they make you worry yourself sick, they're usually brilliant."

Grace swatted him with a dish towel. "What your father means is: we're happy for both of you. And we're sorry."

Sophia blinked. "Sorry for what?"

"For not trusting you sooner. For letting fear make decisions instead of faith." Grace set down the towel, serious now. "You chose MIT in November. You've been working toward this for years. The relationship with Ethan didn't distract you or derail you. If anything, it's made you more focused."

"We handled everything wrong," Michael added, and his voice roughened. "The hotel thing—we should have talked with you, set real boundaries, trusted you to learn from mistakes. Instead we got scared, and that fear let Robert weaponize the legal system. We're sorry it took a court hearing for us to remember who you are."

Sophia felt something crack open in her chest. She'd been strong for months—through restraining orders and court hearings and separation—because breaking down felt like proving Robert right, like demonstrating she couldn't handle this.

But her parents apologizing, admitting they were wrong, trusting her—that broke something loose.

"I'm so angry," she said, and her voice shook. "I'm grateful, and I love you, and I'm also so angry that it took a court hearing for you to trust me. That I had to prove myself legally before you believed I could make good decisions."

Her mother's eyes filled. "I know. You have every right to be angry."

"But I also get it," Sophia continued, words spilling out now. "You were scared. I scared you with the hotel thing. And Robert weaponizing that fear—that's on him, not you. I just wish—" Her throat closed. "I wish we could have gotten here without the lawyers and the judges and all the time we lost being afraid of each other."

"We can't get that time back," Michael said quietly. "But we can do better going forward. That's what we're promising. We were trying to control you," he admitted. "Same thing Robert does to Ethan. Different methods, same impulse. We see that now."

"And watching you handle these past three months with such maturity," Grace added, reaching across to take Sophia's hand, "going to court, respecting the supervision structure, maintaining your grades and training—you showed us we were wrong. So we're apologizing. Truly."

"And we're celebrating," Michael said firmly. "MIT! My brilliant daughter, accepted to one of the best schools in the world, where she will study things I don't understand and probably change the future. That deserves more than my mediocre cooking."

"It deserves takeout," Grace said. "I'll order Thai. You clean up the kitchen disaster you've created."

Sophia laughed, couldn't help it. Her parents bickering in the kitchen, MIT acceptance letter on the counter, Ethan's matching letter fifteen hundred miles away. Everything broken and fixing and growing toward something new.

"Ten days," she said. "Until he's here."

"Ten days," her mother agreed. "And then we'll celebrate together. All of us."

## March 18th - Science Fair Regional Finals (Virtual)

The video call with Mrs. Reimer and the three judges felt surreal. Sophia sat at her desk, laptop angled carefully, wearing the nice shirt she reserved for presentations. On the split screen, Ethan appeared in what looked like his dorm common room, equally formal. Between them, their presentation slides waited to be shared.

"Whenever you're ready," Mrs. Reimer said. She sat in her classroom, playing host to this strange virtual science fair necessitated by geography and restraining orders and teenage determination.

Sophia took a breath. "Good afternoon. We're Sophia Chen and Ethan Price, and we're here to present our research on entropy and information theory."

For the next twenty minutes, they tag-teamed the presentation like they'd practiced a dozen times over video calls. Sophia handled the theoretical mathematics, Ethan explained the practical applications, and together they walked three skeptical judges through research that proved compression algorithms and thermodynamic systems used identical mathematical frameworks.

"Impressive," Judge #2 said, a woman in her sixties with sharp eyes. "And you two did this entire project long-distance?"

"Yes, ma'am," Ethan said. "I'm finishing junior year at a prep school in Massachusetts. Sophia's here in Winnipeg. We collaborated via video conference and shared documents."

"Why?" Judge #1 asked—younger, male, clearly curious about the story. "Why not choose a local partner?"

Sophia and Ethan exchanged a look across the screens, some silent communication passing between them about how much to say.

"We work well together," Sophia said finally. "We've known each other since we were kids. When we realized we'd both be doing science fair projects, collaboration made sense even though it would be harder than working with someone local."

"The constraint actually helped," Ethan added. "It forced us to be more organized, more precise in our communication. Every meeting had to count. Every calculation had to be checked more carefully because we couldn't just turn to each other and verify in person."

"Constraint breeds creativity," Sophia said, and met his eyes through the camera. "Sometimes the limitations make the work better."

Judge #3, an older man with a University of Manitoba lanyard, leaned forward. "The mathematics here is graduate level. Where did you learn this?"

"Independently," Sophia said. "I've been studying advanced mathematics since freshman year. MIT OpenCourseWare, textbooks, online lectures. Ethan's been doing the same with physics and thermodynamics."

"And you're both juniors?"

"Yes, sir."

"Planning to study STEM in college?"

"We've both been accepted to MIT," Ethan said, and Sophia heard the quiet pride in his voice. "Class of 2028."

The judges exchanged looks. Mrs. Reimer was smiling in the background.

They asked fifteen more minutes of questions—about methodology, about verification, about applications and future research directions. Sophia and Ethan answered everything smoothly, their preparation paying off, the partnership visible even through screens and distance.

"Thank you," Judge #1 said finally. "We'll deliberate and announce winners in an hour. Excellent work, both of you."

The call ended. Sophia slumped in her chair, adrenaline fading.

Her phone rang immediately: Ethan.

"I think we got it," he said.

"The way they were looking at us?"

"We definitely got it."

"Don't jinx it."

"I'm not jinxing. I'm confident. There's a difference." He paused. "Eight days."

"Eight days." Sophia spun her chair, looking at the MIT acceptance letter she'd pinned to her bulletin board. "When you're here, we present at state finals together. In person. No screens."

"In person," he agreed. "Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"This project—working on it with you, building something that proved we're good together even when we're apart—it's been the best part of these months. Better than the phone calls or emails, even. Making something. Creating something that wouldn't exist without both of us."

"That's what partnership is," Sophia said. "Making something bigger than either person alone."

"Yeah." His voice softened. "That's exactly what it is."

An hour later, the email came: First Place. They'd won regionals. Next stop: state finals on March 26th. Together. In person. Presenting as partners the way they were always meant to.

## March 20th - The Hockey Game

Sophia watched the prep school championship game from her phone during study hall, Maya running interference with the teacher who didn't technically allow phones during quiet work time. Concordia Prep versus Exeter Academy, regional finals, everything on the line.

Ethan scored in the first period—a beautiful wrister from the slot that beat the goalie clean—and Sophia saw him skate to the bench without celebrating. The team was down 2-1 despite his goal. Something was off in his body language.

By the third period, they'd fallen to 3-2. Ethan assisted on their second goal but missed two open nets himself. The defense was collapsing, the team outmatched, the dream of playoffs dying in real-time.

Final score: 4-2. Season over.

Sophia watched Ethan skate to the bench and pull off his helmet, and even through the grainy livestream she could see something in his face that wasn't devastation.

It was relief.

That night's call—their Wednesday routine—he confirmed what she'd seen in his face on that grainy livestream.

"I should be destroyed," Ethan said, and she could hear him moving around his room, that restless pacing energy he got. "Season over, championship gone, last chance at a prep school title finished. I should care more than this."

"But you don't."

"I don't." He stopped moving, and the silence stretched. "Is that terrible? My team needed me. I played okay but not great. We lost. And instead of being devastated, I feel like—"

"Like what?"

"Like someone unlocked a cage I didn't know I was in." His voice dropped, raw and uncertain. "I watched the clock run out and felt relief, Sophia. Not disappointment. Relief."

Sophia glanced at the basement stairs. Her mother was up there, probably listening, but giving more space these days. Trust earned through weeks of respecting boundaries.

"Tell me what you're thinking," she said quietly.

"I'm thinking I've been playing hockey for him my whole life. Since I was six. Skating drills and practices and games and tournaments—all of it his dream, his plan, his vision of who I should be." Ethan's breathing sounded uneven. "And I was good at it, so I kept doing it. Easier to be good at the thing he valued than to figure out what I actually wanted."

"And now?"

"Now I don't know if I even like it anymore." The admission came out broken. "How messed up is that? Seventeen years of hockey, and I can't tell if I love it or if I just love that it made him proud. Can't tell if losing bothers me or if I'm just performing the emotion I'm supposed to feel."

Sophia's chest ached for him. "What do you like? When you're not performing for anyone?"

Silence. Long enough that she thought he might not answer.

Then: "Science. Math. Building things. Figuring out how systems work and finding the elegant solution." His voice steadied. "Talking to you about thermodynamics at two in the morning. Working on our project. Reading about quantum mechanics just because it's interesting, not because it's on a test."

"You."

"What?"

"I like you," he said simply. "The version of me that exists when I'm with you. The one who's curious instead of competitive. Who wants to understand things instead of win things. Who gets to choose what matters instead of having it chosen for me."

Sophia felt tears prick her eyes. "That's who you actually are."

"Maybe. Or maybe that's who I want to be, and I don't know if there's a difference." He was pacing again, she could hear it. "But I know I can't keep playing hockey just because my dad needs me to. Can't keep following a path I never chose just because changing direction feels like failure."

"You're seventeen. You're allowed to change direction."

"In four months I'm eighteen. Legal adult. Free to make my own decisions without his permission." Something shifted in his tone, became more determined. "I've been thinking about that a lot. About what happens when I'm legally free from his control. About what I can do now to prepare for that freedom."

"Like what?"

"I'll tell you when I'm there. Seven days, Sophia. Seven days and I can say everything in person. Show you what I've been working on."

She wanted to push, wanted to know what he was planning, but she'd learned patience these months. Seven days. She could wait seven days.

"Hey," Ethan said, softer now. "How's badminton training?"

"Brutal. Maya's been running me into the ground. Regionals are next week, two days before you arrive. If I place top three, I qualify for provincials."

"You'll place."

"You don't know that."

"I know you. When you want something, you get it. You wanted MIT—you got it. You want provincials—you'll get there too."

Sophia smiled despite herself. "I want you here."

"That you'll definitely get. Seven days. Then five whole days together."

"Supervised."

"Still together." He paused. "I have a quiz tomorrow. AP Calc. Should probably study."

"I have badminton practice at six AM. Should probably sleep."

"Seven days."

"Seven days."

After they hung up, Sophia sat in the basement quiet and thought about relief. About Ethan feeling free from hockey the way she'd felt free from her parents' fear after the hearing. About how sometimes losing was winning when it meant the right doors closing so better ones could open.

## March 23rd - The Conversation

Her parents asked her to sit down after dinner, which was never a good sign. But instead of looking serious or concerned, they looked...thoughtful.

"We want to talk about spring break," Michael said. "About Ethan visiting."

Sophia's guard went up immediately. "The judge approved it. The conditions are clear—"

"We're not changing anything," Grace interrupted. "We're apologizing."

"Again?"

"Again. Properly this time." Her mother sat across from her at the dining table, hands folded. "We've spent these past few weeks watching you handle separation and structure with such maturity. Respecting the supervision, maintaining your grades, excelling at badminton, winning science fair. You've proven everything we were afraid you couldn't do."

"Which means our fear was about us, not you," Michael added. "We were scared of you getting hurt, of making mistakes we couldn't protect you from, of losing control. So we reacted with rules and restrictions instead of trust."

"You lied about the hotel," Grace said. "That's on you. But everything that followed—the way Robert weaponized that mistake, the restraining order, the court battle—that showed us what real lack of trust looks like. What happens when a parent decides control matters more than relationship."

Michael leaned forward. "Robert Price is destroying his relationship with his son because he can't let go. We don't want to be that. We don't want to lose you because we're too afraid to trust you."

Sophia blinked against sudden tears. "Where's this coming from?"

"From watching you," Grace said simply. "From seeing how you and Ethan handle adversity. From realizing that our job isn't to prevent you from making mistakes. It's to help you learn from them."

"So spring break," Michael said. "The supervision requirement stands—that's court-ordered, we can't change it. But we're going to give you space. Real space. We'll be available, we'll be around, but we're not going to hover. You two have earned privacy within the parameters."

"And after spring break," Grace added, "when you go back to phone calls and emails, we're going to step back even more. You've proven you can be responsible. We need to prove we can trust."

Sophia wiped her eyes, not quite crying but close. "I don't know what to say."

"Say you'll keep being honest with us," Michael said. "That's all we need. Honesty and respect, and we'll give you the same."

"I can do that."

"We know you can. You've been doing it." Grace stood, came around the table to hug her. "Ethan's a good kid going through hell with his father. When he's here, we want him to feel safe. Supported. Part of the family. Can you help us do that?"

"Yeah," Sophia said, voice muffled in her mother's shoulder. "I can."

That night, she emailed Ethan even though they'd talked earlier:

**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** four days

My parents just told me they're backing off on supervision. Still court-required, but with more trust. They want you to feel welcome here. Safe.

I know your dad said not to come home if you come here. I know that's hard. But you have a place here with us. For spring break, but also—if you need it—for more than that.

Four days. Then I get to see your face.

—S

His response came an hour later:

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** RE: four days

Tell your parents thank you. It means more than they know.

I have something to tell you when I'm there. Something I've been working on. It's big, Sophia. It changes everything.

But I think it changes everything in the right way.

Four days. Then you'll understand.

—E

## March 24th - Eve

Sophia couldn't sleep. She'd tried—warm milk, reading, meditation breathing exercises Maya had taught her—but midnight became one AM became two AM and she was still wide awake, staring at her ceiling, thinking about tomorrow.

Tomorrow Ethan would land in Winnipeg. After seventy days of separation, after court hearings and supervised calls and emails in code, after maintaining relationship through structure and patience and sheer stubborn hope—tomorrow they'd be in the same city again.

Five days together. Science fair state finals on day two. Her badminton tournament on day three. Skating and The Forks and walking around the city they both knew but had never explored together. Five days of supervised freedom, of being visible and legal and together in the world.

And whatever he needed to tell her. Something big. Something that changed everything.

Her phone screen glowed: 2:17 AM.

A text arrived: Can't sleep.

She smiled and typed back: Me neither.

His response: Tomorrow.

Tomorrow, she agreed.

Too much to say. Too much built up. Three months of separation compressed into five days.

I know, she sent. We'll figure it out.

Together?

Together.

Her phone rang—actually rang at 2:17 AM—and Sophia answered in the dark, heart already racing because middle-of-the-night calls meant something was wrong or something was so right it couldn't wait.

"Hey," Ethan said, voice rough with exhaustion and something else.

"Are you okay?"

"I'm breaking the rules." He said it quietly, deliberately. "We're supposed to do scheduled supervised calls. This is neither scheduled nor supervised. Your parents are asleep. Mine think I'm asleep. And I don't care anymore, Sophia. I needed to hear your voice without performance, without audience. Just you."

Her throat tightened. The vulnerability in his voice—raw and unguarded in a way supervised calls never allowed.

"I'm glad you called."

"I'm scared," he admitted. "That tomorrow—today now, I guess—when I get there, it won't be what I've been imagining for seventy days. That we've built this up too much in our heads and reality will be awkward or disappointing or prove that distance was actually easier than proximity."

"Nothing about you disappoints me."

"You don't know what I'm going to tell you. This thing I've been working on—it's big, Sophia. It changes everything. And I don't know if you'll think I'm brave or insane or if you'll look at me differently after."

"Probably both. I usually think both things about you simultaneously." She rolled onto her side, phone pressed to her ear, pulling his hoodie tighter around her shoulders. "Brave and a little bit insane. That's kind of your brand."

He laughed, and some of the tension left his voice. "I've missed this. Just talking to you without worrying about who's listening or what we're allowed to say. Without performing for parents or lawyers or judges."

"Me too." Sophia closed her eyes, imagining him in his dorm room fifteen hundred miles away, lying in the dark the same way she was. "What time is your flight?"

"Six AM. I should sleep."

"You should definitely sleep."

"But I want to stay on the phone with you until dawn and just exist in this space where we're breaking rules and it feels like freedom instead of rebellion."

"That sounds perfect," Sophia admitted. "But also you'll be completely miserable on a six AM flight if you don't sleep. And I want you coherent when you get here, not a zombie who slept through his alarm."

"Worth it, though. Losing sleep to talk to you without supervision."

"Not worth it. Sleep. Tomorrow—today—you'll be here, and we'll have five whole days of existing in the same space. Breaking rules in person."

"Supervised."

"Still real. Still us. Still better than phone calls."

"Still real," he agreed, and she heard him shifting, settling. "Okay. Sleeping. But Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for answering. For always answering when I call, even when I'm breaking rules or falling apart or being irrational at two in the morning."

"Always." She meant it. "That's what this is. We answer when the other calls. No matter what."

"No matter what," he echoed. "Okay. Six hours. Then wheels up. Then I'm there."

"Then you're here."

"See you soon."

"So soon."

They hung up, and Sophia lay in the dark with her phone against her chest, his voice still echoing in her ear. The intimacy of that call—unsupervised, unguarded, just them in the middle of the night being honest about fear and hope—felt more precious than any supervised Wednesday conversation.

Tomorrow he'd be here. Real and solid and present.

After seventy days.

After everything.

Tomorrow.

She fell asleep with his hoodie wrapped around her and woke four hours later to her alarm, feeling both exhausted and more awake than she'd been in months.

Today.

Finally, impossibly, today.
