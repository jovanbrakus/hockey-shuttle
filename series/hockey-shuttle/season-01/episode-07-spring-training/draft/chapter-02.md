# CHAPTER 2: WITHIN THE LINES

## Late February - Week 21

The supervised calls happened in the basement.

Sophia sat on the old couch that her parents had relegated to the rec room years ago, phone on speaker on the coffee table, and tried to have an intimate conversation while knowing her mother sat at the top of the stairs pretending to fold laundry. The first Wednesday after the hearing felt surreal: dialing his number legally, hearing him answer, talking without the constant terror of getting caught.

"Hey," Ethan said, his voice crackling through the speaker, exhaustion evident even through the connection. It was eight PM Winnipeg time, nine in Massachusetts, and he'd had hockey practice after classes.

"Hey yourself." Sophia pulled her knees up, wrapped in his Concordia hoodie that she could finally admit to having kept. "How was practice?"

"Coach worked us into the ground. Playoffs start next week—we're playing Exeter in the first round." He paused. "Your parents are listening, aren't they?"

"My mom's upstairs."

"Hi, Mrs. Chen."

From the stairs, Grace's voice drifted down: "Hello, Ethan."

He laughed, and Sophia heard the strangeness in it—trying to be casual while under surveillance. "This is going to take some getting used to."

"Better than nothing."

"Way better than nothing." Something rustled on his end, probably him shifting on his bed. She tried to picture it: the prep school dorm room she'd never seen, the life he lived that didn't include her. "I got the science fair packet from Mrs. Reimer today. She said we're still partners even though I'm remote?"

"Yeah. I told her we'd make it work. We can video conference for the research and present together at the state finals." Sophia opened her laptop, pulling up their shared document. "I've been working on the entropy calculations. Want to hear?"

"Always."

So she walked him through the math, the elegant dance of thermodynamics and information theory, systems tending toward disorder without external energy input. Her mother's footsteps retreated up the stairs—laundry done, supervision maintained at a distance—and for twenty minutes they were just two nerds getting excited about science.

"That's brilliant," Ethan said when she finished explaining her approach to measuring information loss. "You basically proved that entropy and data compression use the same mathematical framework."

"We proved it. This was your idea initially."

"You made it work." She could hear the smile in his voice. "See? We're better together. Even fifteen hundred miles apart."

"Speaking of together—spring break. I've been thinking about what we should do."

"Sophia, as long as I'm in the same city as you, I don't care what we do."

"I care. It's five days. I want them to matter." She'd been making lists, planning the way she planned everything. "Science fair is the 26th, so that's day two. My badminton tournament is the 27th. But we should go skating, walk The Forks, see the city, actually be together in the world."

"All supervised."

"All supervised," she agreed. "But visible. Legal. No hiding."

"No hiding," he repeated. "That'll be weird."

"Good weird."

"The best weird."

A beat of silence, comfortable now. Learning to talk like this again after eight weeks of nothing, navigating supervision and distance and the strange new structure of their relationship.

"I'm struggling with thermodynamics homework," Ethan said, and Sophia's mouth quirked.

"Are you?"

"Yeah. Especially the chapter on closed systems and energy transfer. I just can't seem to understand how..." He paused. "How external forces affect internal states."

Oh. Code. He was speaking in code.

"Well," Sophia said carefully, aware of potential listening, "closed systems can't exchange energy with their environment. But when you open the system—allow interaction—energy flows in. It changes everything."

"So the isolation was making the system decay?"

"Entropy increases in closed systems. Without energy input, everything falls apart."

"But if you open it again?"

"Then you can reverse some of the decay. Not all—you can't undo time—but you can introduce order again. Structure. Growth."

"I miss you," he said, dropping the metaphor. "That's what I'm trying to say. These eight weeks were decay. Talking to you is energy input."

From upstairs, her mother's footsteps creaked across the kitchen. Still there, still listening, but the message had been sent and received.

"Thirty-three days," Sophia said. "Until you're here."

"Thirty-three days. I can do thirty-three days."

"Me too."

They talked for another twenty minutes—homework, college mail starting to arrive, Jordan's hockey team making playoffs—before Ethan had to go study for a history test. When they hung up, Sophia sat in the basement quiet, phone dark on the table, and felt something she hadn't in months.

Peace. Not happiness yet, not certainty. But peace.

Her mother appeared at the bottom of the stairs with tea. "You two are ridiculous with the science metaphors."

"You heard that?"

"Sophia, I teach middle school. You think I don't know code when I hear it?" Grace set the tea on the coffee table, sat on the couch beside her daughter. "But also? That was very sweet."

"Mom—"

"I'm serious. I know this is strange, having us supervise. But hearing you two talk about science, about school, about normal things? It helps. You're not some dramatic forbidden romance. You're two smart kids who care about each other and happen to be good at physics."

Sophia picked up the tea—jasmine, her favorite. "You really don't mind? Him visiting for spring break?"

"I mind that it took a restraining order and a court hearing to get here. I don't mind you having a boyfriend who treats you well." Grace tucked her feet under her, settling in. "Your father and I talked. We handled the hotel thing badly. We were scared, and we reacted out of fear instead of trust. That's on us."

"I lied to you. That's on me."

"You did. And we addressed that. But Robert Price turned a parenting issue into a legal battle, and that's on him." Grace's voice hardened. "What kind of father does that to his own son?"

The question Sophia had been asking herself for eight weeks. What kind of father indeed.

## Early March - Week 22

The emails started cautiously. Both of them aware that parents could read everything, that supervision meant privacy was conditional. But slowly, as days became weeks, they found their rhythm.

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** entropy research notes

Sophia—

Attached are my calculations for the information loss rates in the compression algorithm. I think I found an error in equation 7—should be log base 2, not natural log. Let me know if you see it differently.

Also, I've been thinking about what you said on our call about closed systems. You were right. Complete isolation causes decay. These past few months proved that. Being able to talk to you again—even with parameters—feels like the system opening up. Like order emerging from chaos.

Spring break tickets are booked. March 25th, 10:15 AM arrival. I land on a Tuesday morning and don't leave until Sunday dawn. Five days feels like forever and also not long enough.

Twenty-eight days.

—E

P.S. You were right about the equation. I'll fix it tonight.

**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** RE: entropy research notes

Ethan—

Equation was definitely log base 2. I'm sending my corrections in green. This is going to be a really strong project. Mrs. Reimer thinks we might place at state, which would be scholarship money for college.

Speaking of college: MIT and Caltech both sent acceptance packets this week. Heavy envelopes, thick with information. I opened MIT's first and just stared at it for ten minutes. Getting in early action was one thing. Having the actual acceptance letter in my hands is different. Real.

Did you get yours?

Twenty-eight days. I've been training extra hard at badminton. Maya says I'm playing angry, which apparently means I'm playing well. Regionals are the week before you arrive. If I place top three, I qualify for provincials in April.

Everything is happening at once. It feels like time compressed into these few weeks.

—S

P.S. The system is definitely opening. I can feel it.

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** MIT

Got my acceptance this morning.

My dad called it "settling." Settling. As if MIT is some kind of backup plan instead of one of the best schools in the world. He wanted me to defer, keep training, go straight into NHL drafts.

I said no.

First time I've really said no to him about hockey. He hung up. Haven't heard from him since.

But I'm holding this acceptance letter, and all I can think is: you did this first. You chose MIT in November when we'd barely started figuring out what we were. You weren't influenced by me. You just knew what you wanted. And somehow that gave me permission to want it too.

Spring break. We need to talk about college stuff in person. About what happens next. About MIT and housing and if we're really doing this together.

Twenty-seven days.

## Mid-March - Week 23

Sophia watched the livestream on her phone during lunch period, earbuds in, trying to split her attention between Ethan's prep school hockey game and Maya talking about badminton strategy across the cafeteria table.

"You're not listening," Maya said.

"I am. Crosscourt drops to his backhand, overhead clear when he expects smash."

"While watching hockey."

"I'm excellent at multitasking." On the screen, Concordia Prep was down 3-2 with five minutes left in the third period. Ethan had scored both their goals, but the defense was collapsing. Regional finals, everything on the line, and they were losing.

Jordan slid into the seat beside her, lunch tray balanced precariously. "How's it looking?"

"Not good." Sophia turned the phone so he could see. On screen, Ethan fought for the puck in the corner, got slammed into the boards, came up with possession and sent a pass across ice that his teammate missed completely.

"They're playing sloppy," Jordan said. "Exeter's defense is too strong."

Maya leaned over to look. "Is that Ethan? Number 19?"

"Yeah."

"He looks miserable."

He did. Even through the small screen, even with the grainy livestream quality, Sophia could see it in his body language. Not just losing—something else. Something defeated that had nothing to do with the score.

The game ended 4-2. Concordia eliminated from playoffs. Ethan skated to the bench and didn't look up.

"He'll be devastated," Jordan said quietly.

But when Sophia called him that night—supervised call, Wednesday routine—he didn't sound devastated.

He sounded relieved.

"I know I should care," Ethan said, and she could hear him pacing, that restless energy he got when processing difficult things. "The team needed me, Coach was counting on me, it was regionals. I should be destroyed right now."

"But you're not."

"I'm not." He stopped moving. "Is that terrible? My team lost, season's over, and I feel like someone lifted weight off my shoulders."

Sophia glanced at the stairs. Her mother was up there, listening as required, but she'd given Sophia slightly more space lately. Trust earned slowly.

"What does that mean?" Sophia asked. "About hockey?"

"I don't know yet. Maybe that I've been playing for the wrong reasons. Maybe that I'm tired of my dad living through me. Maybe that losing was permission to admit I'm not sure I want this to be my whole life."

"What do you want it to be?"

"I don't know. But I want to figure it out. On my own terms." His voice steadied. "Twenty-three days until spring break. I've been counting down since the hearing. Now I'm counting down to telling you something I've been working on."

"Telling me what?"

"In person. Face to face. It's too important for phone calls."

Sophia's curiosity sparked—what could be too important for supervised calls but okay for supervised visits?—but she let it go. "Okay. Twenty-three days."

"Are you nervous? About me visiting?"

"Terrified."

"Why?"

"Because what if eight weeks changed things? What if we're different now?"

"Then we figure out who we are now," Ethan said simply. "Together."

From upstairs, Grace cleared her throat—time limit approaching.

"I have to go," Sophia said. "History essay due tomorrow."

"I have calculus. But Sophia?"


"Yeah?"

"We're not different. We're just further along. That's not the same thing."

After they hung up, Sophia sat with those words. Further along. Not apart, not different. Just moving forward through time and separation toward whatever came next.

## Late March - Week 24

The college mail avalanche arrived all at once: Stanford, Caltech, MIT, even a few others they'd applied to as backups. Thick envelopes for both of them. Acceptances everywhere.

Sophia spread them across her bed and took a picture, sent it to Ethan with the caption: decisions decisions.

He sent back a photo of his own collection: identical schools, identical acceptances, parallel lives converging.

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** May 1st

So we have to decide by May 1st. That's six weeks after spring break. Forty-one days from today.

I keep looking at these letters and thinking: what if we choose wrong? What if we pick MIT and hate it? What if we pick different schools and being apart destroys everything we're trying to build?

My dad wants me to defer everywhere and train. Get drafted, play a few years, then go to college if I still want to. He's been leaving voicemails about "keeping options open" and "not limiting myself" which really means "do what I want."

I'm not going to.

But I need to talk to you about this in person. About what we want, what we're willing to risk, what happens if we choose wrong.

Eighteen days until I see you.

—E

**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** RE: May 1st

I've been thinking about this constantly. MIT was my dream before you were part of my present. But now? The idea of going there without you feels incomplete. And the idea of choosing it just because you might be there feels like betraying the version of me who wanted it first.

How do we make decisions when everything is tangled together?

Maya says I'm overthinking. Jordan says we have time. My parents say we should visit campuses and see how we feel. But none of them understand what it's like to have your futures be both independent and connected.

We'll figure it out. We have to.

Seventeen days. Science fair state finals are day two of your visit. We present at 2 PM. Are you nervous?

—S

**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** not nervous

I'm not nervous about science fair. Our research is solid, our presentation is polished, and we work well together. Judges will see that.

I'm nervous about everything else. About seeing you in person after all this time. About whether the supervised thing will be awkward. About telling you what I need to tell you and whether it changes everything.

But also? I'm excited. I've been gray-scale for months, Sophia. Functional but flat. Talking to you weekly, emailing, working on the project—it's helped. But it's not the same as being in the same room, breathing the same air, existing in the same space.

Sixteen days.

—E

P.S. I told my dad I'm visiting Winnipeg for spring break. He said if I go, don't bother coming back. I'm going anyway.

## March 24th - Eve of Spring Break

Sophia couldn't sleep. Tomorrow—no, today now, it was past midnight—Ethan would land in Winnipeg at 10:15 AM. Six hours from now he'd be wheels-up in Boston. Eight hours from now she'd be at the airport with her parents, waiting at arrivals, seeing him in person for the first time since December.

Seventy days since Christmas. Ninety-three days since the hotel disaster. A lifetime compressed into winter.

She rolled over, checked her phone for the hundredth time. Messages from Jordan (bring breath mints lol), from Maya (don't do anything I wouldn't do, which gives you lots of room), from her mother (get some sleep sweetheart).

And one from Ethan, sent an hour ago when it was 1 AM his time:

Can't sleep. Too much in my head. Too much to tell you. Too much that's been building. Tomorrow changes everything. I hope you're ready.

Sophia typed back: I'm ready. Are you?

The response came immediately, like he'd been waiting: Getting there. See you in 8 hours.

Eight hours. Then five days. Then back to separation and phone calls and supervised structure until school ended and they turned eighteen and the world stopped having opinions about who they loved.

Unless something changed. Unless whatever he needed to tell her—whatever had been building—shifted the landscape completely.

Sophia pulled his Concordia hoodie tighter around her and finally fell asleep ninety minutes before dawn, dreaming of airports and spring and order emerging from entropy.

Tomorrow.

After all this time.

Tomorrow.
