## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Episode 7 "Spring Training" delivers strong emotional payoffs and compelling character development, but contains **several critical continuity errors** that need immediate correction before publication. The episode successfully advances the season arc and provides satisfying relationship progression, but timeline inconsistencies, location errors, and character name discrepancies break reader immersion.

**Critical Errors Found**: 5
**Moderate Issues Found**: 7
**Minor Inconsistencies**: 4
**Continuity Strengths**: Multiple areas of excellent tracking

**Overall Assessment**: The episode's emotional core and plot progression are excellent, but factual errors undermine the otherwise strong narrative. These are fixable issues that don't require structural changes, only careful fact-checking against established canon.

## CRITICAL CONTINUITY ERRORS (Must Fix Before Publication)

### 1. ⛔ ETHAN'S BIRTHDAY - MAJOR INTERNAL CONTRADICTION

**Error Location**: Multiple references within Episode 7

**Inconsistency**:
- EPISODE-SUMMARY.md, line 60: "107 days until he turns 18 (August 12th)"
- Chapter 4, line 722: "Seventy more days until I turn eighteen. Less if emancipation goes through." followed by "July 16th"
- These are TWO DIFFERENT DATES within the same episode

**Impact**: Severe. Birthday is a crucial plot point for the countdown to legal freedom.

**Correct Date Required**: Need to verify which is canon and fix all references.

**Calculation Check**:
- If hearing is April 1 and birthday is July 16: 106 days (matches "107 days")
- If hearing is April 1 and birthday is August 12: 133 days (does NOT match)

**Recommendation**: July 16th appears correct based on Episode 7's own math. Change all "August 12th" references to "July 16th" OR recalculate all countdown references.

---

### 2. ⛔ PREP SCHOOL LOCATION - CONTRADICTS EPISODES 5-6

**Error Location**: Throughout Episode 7

**Established Canon (Episodes 5-6)**:
- Episode 5: Ethan sent to prep school in **Michigan**
- Episode 6: Ethan takes "eight-hour bus ride from Michigan" to Minneapolis
- Episode 6: References to "Michigan prep school" throughout

**Episode 7 States**:
- Chapter 1, line 19: "Ethan testifying via video (he's in **Massachusetts**)"
- Chapter 2, line 9: "It was eight PM Winnipeg time, nine in **Massachusetts**"
- Multiple references to "prep school in **Massachusetts**"
- Email address: "ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu"

**Impact**: Severe. This is a major location inconsistency that contradicts two previous episodes.

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Change all Episode 7 references from Massachusetts to Michigan, OR
2. Retroactively establish that he was TRANSFERRED from Michigan to Massachusetts between Episodes 6 and 7 (would require adding explanation)

**Preferred Solution**: Change Episode 7 to Michigan for consistency, as Episodes 5-6 clearly established Michigan.

---

### 3. ⛔ JORDAN'S SURNAME - CHARACTER NAME ERROR

**Error Location**: Chapter 1, line 65

**Established Canon (Episode 1)**:
- "Jordan Nakamura" - used consistently in Episode 1

**Episode 7 States**:
- Chapter 1: "JORDAN: He's logged into the court feed. Watching everything. You've got this. Be the badass I know you are."
- Line 65: "Jordan Chen-Ward, her cousin, Ethan's best friend"

**Additional Context**:
- Episode 4 references "Jordan" (no surname given)
- Episode 6 extensive Jordan role (no surname conflicts noted)

**Impact**: Moderate to Severe. Character names must remain consistent.

**Confusion Factor**: "Chen-Ward" suggests relation to Sophia's family (Chen), but Episode 1 established him as "Nakamura"

**Recommendation**:
1. Change "Jordan Chen-Ward" to "Jordan Nakamura" in Episode 7, OR
2. If intentional name change, explain the relationship (cousin through which parent? Different surname?)
3. Verify Episodes 4-6 for any surname references

---

### 4. ⛔ TIMELINE MATH - "70 DAYS APART" DOESN'T ADD UP

**Error Location**: Chapter 2, line 320; Chapter 4, line 14

**Episode 7 States**:
- Chapter 2: "Seventy days since Christmas. Ninety-three days since the hotel disaster."
- Chapter 4: "Seeing him after 10 weeks (Christmas was 70 days ago)"

**Calendar Math**:
- Christmas: December 25
- Spring Break Arrival: March 25
- Actual days elapsed: **90 days** (not 70)

**Alternative Interpretation**:
- If "last saw him" was January 7-8 (when he left for prep school per Episode 5)
- January 8 to March 25: **76 days** (closer to "70 days")

**Impact**: Moderate. Affects emotional weight of separation.

**Recommendation**:
- If counting from prep school departure (Jan 8): Change to "76 days" or "just over 10 weeks"
- If counting from Christmas: Change to "90 days" or "three months"
- Be consistent about what date the countdown starts from

---

### 5. ⛔ RESTRAINING ORDER TIMELINE CONFUSION

**Error Location**: Chapter 1, lines 7-8

**Episode 6 Ended With**:
- Restraining order hearing scheduled for "Monday 9 AM"
- Valentine's weekend was mid-February
- Immediate crisis requiring Sunday night/Monday morning resolution

**Episode 7 Opens With**:
- "The Hearing" on Monday, February 17, 9 AM
- Chapter 1, lines 7-8: "Eight weeks. Fifty-six days since she'd last seen Ethan in person, since that awful night at the hotel when everything shattered."

**Contradiction**:
- Episode 6 showed them together at Valentine's weekend (mid-February)
- Episode 7 says they haven't seen each other in 8 weeks
- Valentine's Day is February 14; February 17 is 3 days later, not 8 weeks

**Impact**: Severe. Breaks immediate continuity between Episodes 6 and 7.

**Recommendation**:
1. Change "eight weeks" to "six weeks" (from when Ethan left for prep school in early January)
2. Remove reference to "hotel incident" (this may refer to an unwritten event)
3. Clarify LAST TIME they saw each other in person (was it Valentine's weekend in Minneapolis or prep school departure?)

---

## MODERATE CONTINUITY ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 6. 📋 SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT - MISSING SETUP

**Issue**: Episode 7 extensively features science fair collaboration, regional wins, and state championship, but earlier episodes don't establish this project.

**What Episode 7 Shows**:
- Chapter 2: Science fair collaboration emails and video meetings
- Chapter 3: Virtual regional science fair win (March 18)
- Chapter 4: State finals on March 26, winning gold medal
- Deep partnership over entropy/information theory research

**What Earlier Episodes Showed**:
- Episodes 1-4: No mention of science fair
- Episode 5: No mention of science fair
- Episode 6: Science Olympiad mentioned (different competition)

**Impact**: Moderate. Feels like the project appeared out of nowhere.

**Recommendation**:
1. Add brief science fair mention to Episode 6 ("Science fair regional competition coming up")
2. OR add author's note explaining this was an ongoing project
3. Retroactive continuity: Seed science fair partnership in earlier episodes during revision

---

### 7. 📋 MIT ACCEPTANCE TIMING

**Issue**: Clarity needed on early action vs. regular decision acceptance

**Episode 7 States**:
- March 15: MIT acceptance letters arrive for both
- Chapter 3: "She was accepted early action to MIT—before this relationship intensified—based on her own merit"

**Context from Earlier Episodes**:
- Episode 4: College application deadline mentioned (December)
- Episode 1: MIT mentioned as dream school

**Potential Confusion**:
- Early action results typically arrive in December
- Regular decision arrives in March
- Episode 7 suggests Sophia got early action but acceptance letter arrives in March

**Impact**: Minor to Moderate. Could confuse readers familiar with college admissions.

**Recommendation**: Clarify that:
- Sophia received early action ACCEPTANCE in December (mentioned in Episode 4)
- March letter is official ENROLLMENT package/final confirmation
- OR both applied regular decision with March results

---

### 8. 📋 HOTEL INCIDENT REFERENCE - UNSHOWN EVENT

**Issue**: Episode 7 repeatedly references "hotel incident" that wasn't shown in Episodes 1-6

**Episode 7 References**:
- Chapter 1, line 8: "that awful night at the hotel when everything shattered"
- Chapter 4, line 722: "Seventy more days until I turn eighteen"

**What Episodes 1-6 Showed**:
- Episode 5: Motel room in Grand Forks during blizzard (legitimate, storm-stranded)
- No other hotel/motel incident shown

**Possibilities**:
1. "Hotel incident" refers to Grand Forks motel (Episode 5)
2. There was an earlier hotel incident not written yet
3. Placeholder from different plot outline

**Impact**: Moderate. Creates confusion about what event is being referenced.

**Recommendation**:
- If referring to Grand Forks: Change "hotel" to "motel" and add context ("Grand Forks")
- If different incident: Either write that episode or remove references
- Clarify in text what incident is meant

---

### 9. 📋 MICHAEL CHEN'S LEGAL EXPERTISE - SUDDEN SHIFT

**Issue**: Michael Chen goes from background parent to confident litigator with no transition

**Episode 1 Characterization**:
- "Parents (Sophia's): Well-meaning, miss emotional cues, academic-focused"
- No mention of legal background

**Episode 7 Characterization**:
- Law professor at University of Manitoba
- Pro bono representation in court
- "I teach about contracts and family law and the systems meant to protect people"
- Coaching Ethan on emancipation petition

**Impact**: Moderate. Character consistency issue, though not impossible.

**What Works**:
- Parents evolved from Episodes 3-6, showing growth
- Law professor background explains legal knowledge

**What's Missing**:
- No earlier establishment of his legal background
- Sudden expertise feels convenient

**Recommendation**:
1. Add brief mention of Michael's law professor role in earlier episodes during revision
2. OR add line in Episode 7 establishing this was always his profession ("As a law professor, I teach...")
3. Episode 7 actually does this fairly well - may just need earlier seeding

---

### 10. 📋 EMANCIPATION PETITION TIMING

**Issue**: Compressed timeline for emancipation filing and hearing

**Episode 7 Timeline**:
- February 17: Restraining order hearing (conditional contact approved)
- February 20: Ethan files for emancipation (3 days later)
- Original hearing: April 15 (8 weeks to prepare)
- Robert moves it to April 1 (6 weeks to prepare)
- Then moved again to March 31 (only 6 weeks total)

**Legal Reality Check**:
- Emancipation petitions typically require significant preparation
- Filing to hearing in 6-8 weeks is extremely fast
- Moving hearing up multiple times seems unusual

**Impact**: Minor to Moderate. Legal procedure skepticism.

**Recommendation**:
- Add line about judge granting "expedited hearing" due to circumstances
- Michael Chen could mention this is unusual but possible
- Acknowledge the compressed timeline is aggressive

---

### 11. 📋 BADMINTON TOURNAMENT PROGRESSION

**Issue**: Episode 7 has badminton regionals before spring break, but timeline unclear

**Episode 7 States**:
- Chapter 2: "Her badminton regionals training intensifies"
- Late March regionals mentioned

**Earlier Episodes Showed**:
- Episode 3: Provincial badminton championships (October), silver medal
- Episode 6: Badminton invitational in Minneapolis (Valentine's weekend)

**Question**: Are the March "regionals" the same as October "provincials" or different competition?

**Impact**: Minor. Tournament structure clarity.

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify competitive badminton season structure
- If provincials were in October, what is March competition?
- Consistent terminology needed

---

### 12. 📋 ROBERT'S PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION TACTIC

**Issue**: Dramatic escalation feels slightly unmotivated

**Episode 7 Ending**:
- Robert files emergency psychiatric evaluation
- Claims Ethan mentally unfit for emancipation
- Moves hearing up, then delays it

**Earlier Episodes**:
- Robert uses legal threats, MIT bribes, physical control
- But psychiatric claims are new level

**What Works**:
- Escalation is believable for desperate parent
- Fits pattern of using every weapon available

**What's Missing**:
- Slight setup that Robert would go this far
- Could use one more step before psychiatric claims

**Impact**: Minor. More dramatic escalation foreshadowing would help.

**Recommendation**:
- Episode 6 could have included Robert mentioning "mental health concerns"
- OR Episode 7 could add scene where Robert's lawyers suggest this tactic
- Currently works but could be slightly better set up

---

## MINOR INCONSISTENCIES (Optional Fixes)

### 13. ✏️ SUPERVISED CALL FREQUENCY

**Episode 7 States**: Weekly supervised phone calls
**Earlier Episodes**: Burner phones for near-nightly calls

**Resolution**: Timeline between Episodes 6 and 7 involved phone confiscation and legal structure, so shift from burner phones to weekly supervised makes sense. Not an error, just a shift in circumstances.

---

### 14. ✏️ BECCA MARTINEZ ABSENCE

**Note**: Becca (Ethan's ex-girlfriend) appeared in Episodes 1-3 but disappears after breakup. Episode 7 has no mention of her.

**Impact**: None. Natural character exit after breakup.

**Observation**: Could have one line acknowledging her moved on, but absence is acceptable.

---

### 15. ✏️ MAYA'S ROLE CONSISTENCY

**Episode 7**: Maya still coaching Sophia hard, training for regionals
**Earlier Episodes**: Strong mentor/friend role established

**Observation**: Excellent character consistency. Maya's voice and role remain true to earlier characterization.

---

### 16. ✏️ WEATHER PROGRESSION

**Episode 7 Weather Details**:
- February 17: -15°C, grey, winter gripping
- Late February: -10°C to 0°C, ice beginning to crack
- Mid-March: 5°C, snow melting, mud season
- Spring break (March 25): 8-12°C, spring arriving

**Winnipeg Reality**: Accurate for the region. Excellent atmospheric detail.

**Observation**: One of Episode 7's strengths - weather mirrors relationship thaw beautifully.
