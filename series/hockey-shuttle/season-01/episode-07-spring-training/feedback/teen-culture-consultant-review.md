**Overall Authenticity Rating:** 6/10

## Executive Summary

Episode 7 presents an emotionally compelling story with strong legal and interpersonal drama. The relationship progression feels genuine, and the characters' emotional responses are authentic. However, the episode suffers from **significant contemporary teen culture authenticity issues**, primarily around:

1. **Overly formal communication style** - Teens in 2025 don't communicate this formally, even smart ones
2. **Minimal contemporary language** - Almost no current teen slang or speech patterns
3. **Dated digital communication** - Email usage feels old-fashioned; texting style is too proper
4. **Absent social media presence** - Despite the plot revolving around teen lives, social media is nearly invisible
5. **Missing friend group dynamics** - No group chats, minimal digital friend presence
6. **Lack of cultural touchstones** - No music, memes, or pop culture references that ground it in 2025

The characters read more like articulate young adults from 2010-2015 rather than contemporary 2025 teenagers. While the emotional authenticity is strong, the cultural authenticity needs significant work to feel current and relatable to actual Gen Z readers.

## What Works Well

### Emotional Authenticity ✓
- The supervised calls creating awkwardness is spot-on
- Parents "pretending not to listen" while clearly listening is realistic
- The anxiety around court proceedings feels genuine
- The reunion scene captures real emotion
- The exhaustion of maintaining a relationship under surveillance is well-portrayed

### Technology Integration (Partial) ✓
- Video conference for court testimony is realistic post-2020
- Livestreaming hockey games is accurate
- Constant phone checking is authentic
- Using shared documents for school projects is correct

### Academic Pressure ✓
- College acceptance stress is well-captured
- MIT decision anxiety is realistic
- Science fair competition feels authentic
- The weight of "thick envelope = acceptance" still resonates

### Relationship Dynamics ✓
- The progression from supervised to slightly more trusted is believable
- Physical touch after deprivation (hugging, hand-holding) rings true
- The "are we different now?" fear is universal
- Partnership through adversity is compelling

## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

## 1. DIALOGUE AND LANGUAGE AUTHENTICITY

### Issue: Overly Formal Speech for 2025 Teens

The dialogue throughout Episode 7 is too polished and formal. Even highly intelligent teenagers in 2025 speak more casually than these characters. The current dialogue makes them sound like articulate 25-year-olds rather than 17-year-olds.

#### Examples with Specific Fixes:

**CHAPTER 1, Current Text:**
> "Sophia, you look beautiful in anything, and he's not going to care what you're wearing,"

**Problem:** This is fine, actually. Grace's dialogue as a parent works.

**CHAPTER 1, Current Text:**
> "Are you okay?"
> "I'm—" Her voice broke. "I'm so okay. Are you?"

**Problem:** Too complete. Teens fragment more under emotional stress.

**Suggested Replacement:**
> "You okay?"
> "I'm—" Her voice broke. "So okay. You?"

---

**CHAPTER 2, Current Text:**
> "Hey," Ethan said, his voice crackling through the speaker, exhaustion evident even through the connection. It was eight PM Winnipeg time, nine in Massachusetts, and he'd had hockey practice after classes.
> "Hey yourself." Sophia pulled her knees up, wrapped in his Concordia hoodie that she could finally admit to having kept. "How was practice?"

**Problem:** "Hey yourself" is slightly outdated. The dialogue is too complete.

**Suggested Replacement:**
> "Hey," Ethan said, voice crackling through the speaker. He sounded exhausted even through the connection.
> "Hey. How was practice?"

---

**CHAPTER 2, Current Text:**
> "I'm struggling with thermodynamics homework," Ethan said, and Sophia's mouth quirked.
> "Are you?"

**Problem:** This code-speak works but the response is too proper.

**Suggested Replacement:**
> "I'm struggling with thermodynamics homework," Ethan said.
> Sophia caught on immediately. "Oh yeah?"

---

**CHAPTER 3, Current Text:**
> "I know. But it's huge. It's me basically telling my dad that I'm done being his son in any legal sense. He won't forgive that."
> "Do you care?"

**Problem:** The question is too direct without softening.

**Suggested Replacement:**
> "I know. But it's huge. Like, basically telling my dad I'm done being his son in any legal sense. He won't forgive that."
> "Do you care? Honestly?"

---

### Issue: Missing Contemporary Teen Language Patterns

The episode lacks contemporary slang and speech markers that would ground it in 2025. Teenagers use filler words, hedging language, and contemporary slang even in serious conversations.

**Missing Language Patterns:**
- "like" as a filler (used sparingly for authenticity)
- "honestly" / "literally"
- "fr" (for real)
- "ngl" (not gonna lie)
- "lowkey" / "highkey"
- "kinda" / "sorta" instead of "kind of"
- "gonna" instead of "going to"
- Question tags: "right?" "yeah?"

#### Specific Opportunities for Natural Teen Speech:

**CHAPTER 1, Current Text:**
> "That's exactly what this is."

**More Authentic:**
> "That's literally what this is."

---

**CHAPTER 2, Current Text:**
> "I'm serious. I know this is strange, having us supervise. But hearing you two talk about science, about school, about normal things? It helps."

**More Authentic:**
> "I'm serious. I know having us supervise is weird. But hearing you two talk about science and school and like, normal things? It actually helps."

---

**CHAPTER 3, Current Text:**
> "You're ridiculous with the science metaphors."

**More Authentic:**
> "You two are so ridiculous with the science metaphors."

---

**CHAPTER 4, Current Text:**
> "This is weird," Ethan said, not letting go of her hand. "Good weird. But weird."
> "Being supervised?"
> "Being together. Legally. In public. No hiding, no sneaking, just existing in the world like normal people."

**More Authentic:**
> "This is weird," Ethan said, not letting go of her hand. "Good weird, but weird."
> "The supervision thing?"
> "Just being together. Out in public, totally legal. Like, no hiding, no sneaking around. Being normal people for once."

---

## 2. TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### Issue: Email Usage Feels Dated

Teenagers in 2025 primarily use email for formal/academic purposes only. For personal communication, even under supervision, they would push the boundaries toward texting, messaging apps, or more casual platforms. The lengthy, formal emails feel like they're from 2010.

**CHAPTER 2, Current Text:**
```
**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** entropy research notes

Sophia—

Attached are my calculations for the information loss rates in the compression algorithm. I think I found an error in equation 7—should be log base 2, not natural log. Let me know if you see it differently.

Also, I've been thinking about what you said on our call about closed systems. You were right. Complete isolation causes decay. These past few months proved that. Being able to talk to you again—even with parameters—feels like the system opening up. Like order emerging from chaos.

Spring break tickets are booked. March 25th, 10:15 AM arrival. I land on a Tuesday morning and don't leave until Sunday dawn. Five days feels like forever and also not long enough.

Twenty-eight days.

—E

P.S. You were right about the equation. I'll fix it tonight.
```

**Problem:**
- Subject line is too formal
- Signing with "—E" is outdated
- The structure is too formal for personal communication
- PS placement is old-fashioned

**More Authentic Version:**
```
**From:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**To:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**Subject:** equation check + other stuff

hey—

attached my calculations for the info loss rates. pretty sure i found an error in equation 7 (should be log base 2 not natural log?) lmk if you see it different.

also been thinking about what you said about closed systems. you were right. complete isolation = decay. these past few months proved that. being able to talk to you again, even with all the rules, feels like the system opening back up. order from chaos and all that.

spring break tickets booked. march 25, 10:15am. five days is simultaneously forever and not nearly enough.

28 days.

(you were def right about the equation btw. fixing tonight)
```

**CHAPTER 2, Current Text:**
```
**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** RE: MIT

I've been thinking about this constantly. MIT was my dream before you were part of my present. But now? The idea of going there without you feels incomplete. And the idea of choosing it just because you might be there feels like betraying the version of me who wanted it first.

How do we make decisions when everything is tangled together?

Maya says I'm overthinking. Jordan says we have time. My parents say we should visit campuses and see how we feel. But none of them understand what it's like to have your futures be both independent and connected.

We'll figure it out. We have to.

Seventeen days. Science fair state finals are day two of your visit. We present at 2 PM. Are you nervous?

—S
```

**More Authentic Version:**
```
**From:** sophia.chen@winnipegmail.ca
**To:** ethan.price@concordiaprep.edu
**Subject:** RE: MIT

ok so i've been thinking about this nonstop. MIT was MY dream before you were even really part of my life. but now the idea of going without you feels incomplete? but also choosing it BECAUSE you're going feels like betraying past me who wanted it first.

how do we make decisions when everything's this tangled up?

maya says i'm overthinking (shocking). jordan says we have time. my parents say visit campuses first. but like, none of them get what it's like to have futures that are separate AND connected at the same time.

we'll figure it out though. we have to.

17 days. science fair state finals are day 2 of your visit. 2pm. you nervous?
```

---

### Issue: Texting Style Too Proper

The text messages shown are too grammatically correct. Teens in 2025 text with lowercase, minimal punctuation, abbreviations, and fragments.

**CHAPTER 3, Current Text:**
> Can't sleep. Too much in my head. Too much to tell you. Too much that's been building. Tomorrow changes everything. I hope you're ready.

**More Authentic:**
> cant sleep. too much in my head
>
> tomorrow changes everything
>
> hope youre ready

(Note: Teens often send multiple separate messages instead of one long one)

---

**CHAPTER 4, Current Text:**
> Outside. Call me when you can.

**More Authentic:**
> outside. call when u can

---

**CHAPTER 4, Current Text:**
> Whatever happens Monday, know that you gave me the courage to fight. Not for you. For me. But you're why I know it's worth it.

**More Authentic:**
> whatever happens monday just know you gave me the courage for this
>
> not fighting for you. fighting for me
>
> but youre why i know its worth it

---

**CHAPTER 4, Current Text:**
> ETHAN: Hearing in 30 minutes. I'm terrified but ready.

**More Authentic:**
> ETHAN: hearing in 30. terrified but ready

---

## 3. SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE (CRITICAL MISSING ELEMENT)

### Issue: Social Media is Nearly Invisible

This is perhaps the most significant authenticity problem. The episode mentions Instagram once in a legal context, but otherwise social media is completely absent from these teenagers' lives. In 2025, social media is how teens exist, communicate, and process their lives—ESPECIALLY during significant events.

### What's Missing:

**During Separation (Chapter 2):**
- No mention of Sophia checking Ethan's Instagram/social media
- No discussion of whether they're still following each other
- No mention of mutual friends' posts
- No Stories being watched
- No indirect communication through likes/comments
- No discussion of what they post (or don't post) about the situation

**After Court Victory (Chapter 1):**
- Friends would be texting/DMing immediately
- The news would spread via group chats instantly
- Maya and Jordan would be in a group chat with Sophia
- There would be discussion about what to post (or not post)

**During Spring Break (Chapter 4):**
- No photos together being taken or posted
- No discussion of Stories documenting their time
- No mention of other people's reactions to them being together
- No checking social media during downtime

### Specific Additions Needed:

**CHAPTER 1 - After Court Ruling:**

**Current Text:**
> Her phone—she'd turned it off for court—buzzed to life with notifications. Messages flooding in.
>
> JORDAN: She modified it! You can talk!
>
> MAYA: Checking news sites. Did you win?

**More Authentic Addition:**
```
Her phone exploded with notifications—texts, Instagram DMs, group chat messages multiplying too fast to read.

JORDAN: She modified it! You can talk!

MAYA: checking news sites did you win???

GROUP CHAT "sophia support squad" (Maya, Jordan, 3 others):
- MAYA: ????? waiting for news
- JORDAN: just ended checking now
- ASHLEY: literally been refreshing updates
- MAYA: SHE MODIFIED IT
- JORDAN: sophia can you even see these rn

Instagram DMs from people she barely knew at school, probably just being nosy. She ignored those.
```

---

**CHAPTER 2 - During Separation:**

**Addition After Paragraph About Weekly Calls:**
```
The worst part was social media. She'd unfollowed him on everything the day after the hotel disaster—her parents had watched her do it, standing over her shoulder. But that didn't stop her from searching his username late at night, looking at his profile through the browser so it wouldn't show she'd visited.

His Instagram was mostly hockey stuff. Team photos, game scores, that one picture of him and Jordan from winter break. Nothing personal. Nothing about her, obviously. But also nothing about anyone else, which she definitely didn't overthink at 2 AM.

Maya had caught her lurking once. "Girl. Stop torturing yourself."

"I'm not. I'm just... checking that he's okay."

"That's literally what texting is for. Except you can't text. Which is why you need to stop looking."

She was right. Sophia deleted Instagram from her phone that night. Reinstalled it two days later. The cycle continued.
```

---

**CHAPTER 4 - Spring Break:**

**Addition During "The Forks" Scene:**
```
"Want a picture?" Sophia asked, pulling out her phone as they walked along the river.

Ethan hesitated. "Are you going to post it?"

"I don't know. Maybe? Is that weird?"

"It's not weird. It's just... public. Everyone will see."

"Everyone already knows. The hearing was basically public record." She held up her phone. "But we don't have to."

"No, let's do it." He pulled her closer, both of them smiling as she angled the camera. Behind them, the river confluence, the spring sun, the city waking up. "We're allowed to exist now. Might as well document it."

She took three photos, chose the best one, started to add a filter then stopped. No filter. Just them, real and together and legal.

Caption: spring💚

She showed him before posting. He nodded. "Simple. I like it."

The likes and comments started immediately. Maya: FINALLY. Jordan: about time. Classmates she barely talked to: so cute! Her cousin: 🙌🙌🙌

And buried in there, one comment from a username she didn't recognize. But the profile picture looked like Ethan's prep school. Someone from his world, reaching into hers. Watching.

She turned off comments after that.
```

---

## 4. FRIEND GROUP DYNAMICS

### Issue: Friends Exist But Feel Digitally Absent

Jordan and Maya are present in person but almost completely absent digitally. In 2025, friend groups exist in constant digital communication—group chats that run all day, every day.

### What's Missing:

- Group chat presence
- Friends checking in daily via text
- Shared social media content
- Friends commenting on each other's posts
- Digital inside jokes
- Ongoing conversations that span days

### Specific Additions:

**CHAPTER 2 - Add Group Chat Scene:**

**New Scene Addition (After Email Section):**
```
Her phone buzzed with the group chat—Maya, Jordan, and her cousin Ashley from Ontario who'd somehow gotten added and now provided running commentary on everything.

MAYA: update on the supervised call situation?

SOPHIA: it's fine. awkward but fine.

JORDAN: does he know your mom is literally sitting on the stairs pretending to fold the same towel for 45 minutes

SOPHIA: omg does she really

JORDAN: i've been to your house sophia. i know the supervision spots.

MAYA: at least you can talk. that's better than nothing

ASHLEY: wait i'm behind what happened in court

JORDAN: judge said supervised contact ok

ASHLEY: that's good right?

SOPHIA: yeah. spring break he can visit.

MAYA: 👀👀👀

JORDAN: chaperoned spring break. so romantic.

SOPHIA: shut up

MAYA: he's not wrong tho

ASHLEY: you guys are weird but like cute weird

The conversation continued without her—Maya sending badminton memes, Jordan sharing something about Michigan visits, Ashley complaining about her own relationship drama. The constant thread of connection, the knowledge that even when she put her phone down, they were still there.
```

---

**CHAPTER 3 - Add Social Media Reaction to MIT:**

**Addition After MIT Acceptance:**
```
She screenshot the acceptance email and sent it to the group chat before remembering her parents were probably more appropriate first contacts. Too late now.

MAYA: YOOOOOOOO

JORDAN: LETS GOOOOO MIT

ASHLEY: sophia!!! congratulations!!!

MAYA: told you

JORDAN: never doubted

SOPHIA: ethan got in too

MAYA: ofc he did

JORDAN: the nerds are nerding together

SOPHIA: we literally had the same stats

JORDAN: and now you'll have the same dorm probably

MAYA: jordan pls

SOPHIA: we haven't decided anything yet

MAYA: but you're gonna choose mit right

SOPHIA: probably? yeah. we'll see.

JORDAN: translation: yes definitely

She ignored them and called Ethan.
```

---

## 5. CULTURAL REFERENCES AND POP CULTURE

### Issue: Completely Absent

The episode lacks any cultural touchstones that would ground it in 2025. No music, no memes, no shows, no movies, no references to anything happening in the world beyond their immediate situation. This makes the world feel sterile and disconnected from reality.

### Needed Additions:

**Music References:**
- Teens always have music playing
- AirPods are constant
- Shared playlists are common
- Music as emotional processing

**Suggested Addition - Chapter 2:**
```
Sophia put on her studying playlist—mostly instrumental stuff that wouldn't distract her from calculus. But halfway through the problem set, a song came on that Ethan had added months ago, back when they were still allowed to share playlists. She'd forgotten it was there.

She let it play through, then deleted it. Too painful.

Then felt guilty and re-added it.

Then deleted it again.

Maya was right. She needed to stop torturing herself.
```

---

**Meme Culture:**

**Suggested Addition - Chapter 3 (Group Chat):**
```
MAYA: [sends meme about waiting for college decisions]

JORDAN: too real

SOPHIA: my email anxiety is so bad right now

MAYA: [sends another meme: "me checking my email every 30 seconds"]

SOPHIA: literally me

ASHLEY: you'll get in. you're like insanely smart

SOPHIA: intelligence and mit acceptance are not perfectly correlated

JORDAN: nerd.

MAYA: she's not wrong tho

SOPHIA: also what if i get in and he doesn't

MAYA: then you go to mit and he goes somewhere else and you figure it out

JORDAN: or he gets in and you both go and keep being annoyingly perfect together

ASHLEY: i vote for option 2
```

---

## 6. MENTAL HEALTH LANGUAGE

### Issue: Absent from Teen Vocabulary

Teenagers in 2025 are remarkably open about mental health, therapy, anxiety, and depression. This language would naturally appear in their conversations, especially given the stress they're under.

**Needed Additions:**

**CHAPTER 2 - During Phone Call:**

**Current Text:**
> "I don't know yet. Maybe that I've been playing for the wrong reasons. Maybe that I'm tired of my dad living through me."

**More Authentic Addition:**
> "I don't know yet. Maybe that I've been playing for the wrong reasons. Maybe that I'm tired of my dad living through me." He paused. "My school counselor keeps suggesting I should like, talk to someone. A therapist or whatever."
>
> "Are you going to?"
>
> "I don't know. Maybe? It feels like admitting defeat. Like I can't handle this on my own."
>
> "That's literally not what therapy is."
>
> "I know. Logically I know that. But still."

---

**CHAPTER 3 - Sophia's Stress:**

**Suggested Addition:**
```
Maya found her in the badminton gym, hitting shuttlecocks with more force than necessary.

"You okay?"

"Fine."

"Sophia."

"I'm fine. Just stressed about college stuff."

"And Ethan stuff?"

"And Ethan stuff. And parent stuff. And legal stuff. And—" She hit another shuttle, watched it sail over the net. "Everything stuff."

"You know it's okay to not be fine, right? Like, this is a lot. You're allowed to be struggling."

"I can't struggle. I have provincials in three weeks, college decisions in May, science fair next month—"

"Which is exactly why you're allowed to struggle." Maya took the racket from her hands. "You can't optimization-algorithm your way out of human emotions. Trust me, I've tried."

Sophia laughed despite herself. "When did you get wise?"

"I've always been wise. You're just usually too busy being perfect to notice."
```

---

## 7. PHONE ADDICTION AND USAGE PATTERNS

### Issue: Phones Aren't Present Enough

Teenagers in 2025 are on their phones CONSTANTLY. The episode mentions checking phones but doesn't show the actual constant presence and checking that defines teen life.

**Needed Additions:**

**CHAPTER 1 - Courthouse:**

**Current Text:**
> A reporter approached—"Miss Chen, do you have any comment about—"—but Michael stepped between them smoothly.

**More Authentic Addition:**
> A reporter approached, phone already recording—"Miss Chen, do you have any comment about—"—but Michael stepped between them smoothly.
>
> "My client has no statement."
>
> Sophia kept her head down, phone face-down in her pocket where she couldn't check it. Her fingers itched to look. Had Ethan texted? Was Jordan updating their group chat? Were people from school seeing this?
>
> Not now. Court first, phone later.

---

**CHAPTER 4 - Spring Break:**

**Addition During Reunion:**
```
They walked through the airport holding hands, and Sophia caught herself reaching for her phone three times to take pictures before remembering that documenting every second wasn't actually living it. But the fourth time, she gave in.

"Wait. I need a picture of us actually together."

"You're such a millennial," Ethan teased.

"Gen Z, actually. And yes." She held up her phone, both of them smiling, her parents visible in the background looking fond and tired. "For when you leave and I need to remember this was real."

She sent it to the group chat immediately.

JORDAN: finally

MAYA: he looks skinny

SOPHIA: he's been stress-eating hockey practice

JORDAN: is that a thing?

MAYA: apparently
```

## SPECIFIC LINE-BY-LINE SUGGESTIONS

### CHAPTER 1: THE HEARING

**Page 1, Current:**
> "Ready?"

**Suggested:**
> "You ready?"

---

**Page 2, Current:**
> "That's exactly what this is."

**Suggested:**
> "That's literally what this is."

---

**Page 3, Current:**

(Teens text with less punctuation and capitalization)

---

**Page 6, Current:**
> "I've been playing hockey since I was five years old," Ethan continued. "It's what my father wanted, what he trained me for, what our whole life has been built around."

**Suggested:**
> "I've been playing hockey since I was five," Ethan continued. "It's what my dad wanted, what he trained me for, what our whole life has been built around."

(Teens say "dad" not "father" in casual speech)

---

### CHAPTER 2: WITHIN THE LINES

**Page 1, Current:**
> "Hey," Ethan said, his voice crackling through the speaker, exhaustion evident even through the connection. It was eight PM Winnipeg time, nine in Massachusetts, and he'd had hockey practice after classes.
> "Hey yourself."

**Suggested:**
> "Hey," Ethan said, voice crackling through the speaker. He sounded exhausted.
> "Hey. How was practice?"

---

**Page 2, Current:**
> "Hi, Mrs. Chen."

**Suggested:**
> This works, but consider adding Sophia's eye roll or reaction to show how weird this supervised situation is.

---

**Page 5, Current:**
> "You two are ridiculous with the science metaphors."

**Suggested:**
> "You two are so ridiculous with these science metaphors."

---

### CHAPTER 3: ACCEPTANCE

**Page 1, Current:**
> *Dear Sophia Chen,*
> *Congratulations! It is with great pleasure that we offer you admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Class of 2028...*

**Suggested Addition After:**
> She screenshot it immediately, sent it to the group chat, then remembered her parents were probably supposed to be first. Whatever. Too late now.

---

**Page 2, Email Format - ALL EMAILS NEED UPDATING:**

Apply the more casual email style suggested in the earlier examples throughout this chapter.

---

**Page 8, Current:**
> "I told you I'm working on something."
> "Tell me."
> "Tomorrow. Last day. I promise."

**Suggested:**
> "I told you I'm working on something."
> "Tell me."
> "Tomorrow. Last day. Promise."

---

### CHAPTER 4: SPRING BREAK

**Page 1, Current:**
> "Hi," Ethan said.
> "Hi yourself."

**Suggested:**
> "Hi," Ethan said.
> "Hey."

("Hi yourself" is dated phrasing)

---

**Page 3, Current:**
> "This is weird," Ethan said, not letting go of her hand. "Good weird. But weird."
> "Being supervised?"
> "Being together. Legally. In public. No hiding, no sneaking, just existing in the world like normal people."

**Suggested:**
> "This is weird," Ethan said, not letting go of her hand. "Good weird. But weird."
> "The whole supervised thing?"
> "Just being together. Like, legally out in public. No hiding, no sneaking. Being normal people for once."

---

**Page 15, Current:**
> "You did it," he said.
> "I did it."

**Suggested:**
> "You did it."
> "I did it."

(Remove "he said" - action indicates speaker)

---

**Page 20, Current - ALL TEXT MESSAGES:**

All text messages throughout need to be reformatted to lowercase, minimal punctuation, as shown in earlier examples.

---

## PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE FIXES (High Impact, Relatively Easy):

1. **Reformat ALL text messages** to lowercase with minimal punctuation
2. **Rewrite email correspondence** to be more casual while maintaining academic veneer
3. **Add "like," "literally," "honestly"** to dialogue sparingly but consistently
4. **Change "father" to "dad"** in dialogue (keep "father" in narration if preferred)
5. **Add group chat scene** in Chapter 2 or 3
6. **Add social media reference** to Sophia checking Ethan's Instagram during separation

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Significant Impact, More Work):

7. **Add social media moment** during spring break reunion
8. **Include mental health language** in at least one conversation
9. **Add music reference** during study/emotional scene
10. **Increase phone checking behaviors** throughout
11. **Add cultural reference** or meme in group chat
12. **Soften formal speech patterns** throughout - more fragments, more casual

### LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (Polish):

13. **Develop friend group digital presence** more fully
14. **Add layers of social media reality** (followers, comments, Stories)
15. **Include more contemporary slang** naturally throughout
16. **Show phone as extension of self** not just communication tool
17. **Add more realistic teen multitasking** (phone + conversation + homework)

---

## FUTURE-PROOFING NOTES

### What Will Date Quickly:
- Specific social media platform names (consider generic references: "she checked his profile" vs "she checked his Instagram")
- Specific app names (consider "video call" vs "FaceTime")
- Specific slang terms (use sparingly, focus on patterns rather than trending words)

### What Will Age Well:
- Emotional authenticity (keep this!)
- Relationship dynamics (strong as is)
- Family tension (universal)
- Academic pressure (timeless for high achievers)
- Supervised teen romance (the structure is compelling)

### Recommendation:
Focus on **communication patterns** and **behavioral markers** rather than specific platform names or trending slang. The way teens communicate (fragmented, casual, constant) will remain more consistent than what platforms they use.

---

## CONCLUSION

Episode 7 has a strong emotional core and compelling narrative arc. The legal framework is interesting, the relationship progression is believable, and the characters are sympathetic. However, **the episode reads like it's set in 2012-2015 rather than 2025** due to:

- Overly formal communication across all mediums
- Minimal contemporary teen language patterns
- Near-total absence of social media despite it being central to teen life
- Missing friend group digital dynamics
- No cultural touchstones to ground it in time

The good news: **These are fixable issues that don't require restructuring the plot.** The changes needed are primarily surface-level—dialogue adjustments, communication style updates, and strategic additions of digital life elements. The emotional authenticity and relationship dynamics that make the episode work can remain intact while the cultural authenticity is brought up to 2025 standards.

**Recommended approach:** Start with high-priority fixes (text messages, emails, adding one group chat scene) and progress to medium-priority improvements. The goal isn't to make these characters sound like stereotypical teens, but to make them sound like *contemporary* smart teens who happen to be going through extraordinary circumstances.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

These characters are compelling, intelligent, and emotionally authentic. They deserve to exist in a world that feels as contemporary as they are. With the suggested changes, Episode 7 can maintain its emotional power while feeling genuinely grounded in 2025 teen culture.

The key is balance: these teens are under unusual stress and dealing with adult-level legal issues, so some formality is appropriate. But even stressed-out, mature teenagers in 2025 text in lowercase, use "literally" as emphasis, check social media constantly, and exist in group chats. Let them be both mature AND authentically teenage.

The story you're telling is important and resonant. Make sure the cultural details don't distract from that by feeling dated before the book is even published.
