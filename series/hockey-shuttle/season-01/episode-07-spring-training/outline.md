# EPISODE 7: "SPRING TRAINING"

## Episode Overview

**Timeline**: Late February to late March (weeks 21-25 of junior year)
**Word Count**: ~20,000 words
**Structure**: 4 chapters × 20 pages each

### Episode Synopsis

After Episode 6's devastating restraining order, Episode 7 opens with hope: the legal hearing where Michael Chen (Sophia's father) represents them pro bono against Robert Price's high-powered lawyers. The judge rules in their favor—conditional contact allowed: supervised, limited, documented. Spring arrives both literally and metaphorically as they navigate this new reality. Science fair collaboration gives legitimate academic contact reason. College acceptances arrive (MIT, Caltech, Stanford for both). Ethan gets approved for a 5-day spring break visit (March 25-29) under strict conditions. The episode builds toward their reunion and a revelation that changes everything: Ethan has filed for legal emancipation. But Robert moves the hearing up to April 1st—three days away—forcing an immediate crisis.
