## Episode Information

## Episode Synopsis
After Episode 7's devastating cliffhanger (Robert blocking emancipation with psych eval, complete isolation), the battle enters its final phase. The psychiatric evaluation backfires when Dr. Martinez finds Ethan completely sound and recommends emancipation proceed. Robert escalates to his ultimate weapon: threatens to withdraw college funding entirely if Ethan doesn't sign NHL draft commitment. College decision deadline is May 1st. Recruiting letters pour in with NHL scouts wanting first-round commitment. Ethan must choose: NHL money and parental approval, or MIT/freedom/Sophia with no financial support. Meanwhile, Sophia competes at National Badminton Championships. The episode builds toward May 1st deadline where both must commit to universities, and Ethan's choice will determine everything. But when they both choose MIT and sign together, Robert reveals his final move: criminal charges against Sophia for "grooming" his son. She has until May 15th emancipation hearing: drop Ethan or face jail.
