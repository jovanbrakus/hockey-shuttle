# CHAPTER 4: SIGNING DAY

May 1st, 5:47 AM. Sophia woke three minutes before her alarm, heart already racing.

The nightmare had been vivid—courtroom, handcuffs, her MIT acceptance letter burning in someone's hands. She'd woken with the taste of fear in her mouth, sheets tangled around her legs, gray dawn light creeping through her bedroom window.

National College Decision Day.

Also: fourteen days until criminal charges.

She rolled over, grabbed her phone from the nightstand. Instagram showed dozens of overnight notifications—more congratulations on her national championship from Sunday, photos of the gold medal ceremony being shared and reshared. Her championship photo had 847 likes now. Comments: "So proud!" and "National champion!" and "MIT is lucky to have you!"

They didn't know. None of them knew that MIT might revoke her acceptance before she ever set foot in Cambridge. That a criminal record could destroy her engineering career before it started. That supporting Ethan's right to choose his own future might cost her everything.

She turned off Instagram and opened her conversation with Ethan. No new messages since last night's "See you this afternoon." They'd agreed to meet at 3 PM to sign their commitment letters together—romantic gesture that now felt weighted with desperation.

What if they were signing documents that would be meaningless in two weeks?

Sophia tried to go back to sleep. Failed. Her mind kept circling: Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Interference with custody. Criminal harassment. Robert's attorney had listed them like menu items, casual recitation of charges that could mean jail time.

At 6:15, she gave up on sleep entirely. Showered, dressed, went downstairs to the kitchen where her mother was already making breakfast.

"You're up early," Helen said, then saw Sophia's face. "Couldn't sleep?"

"Nightmares."

"About today? Or about May 15th?"

"Both."

Helen poured tea, slid the mug across the counter. "Your father's been researching. The charges Robert's threatening—they're difficult to prove. You'd need clear evidence of intent to harm, pattern of behavior, documented interference. Robert has surveillance and timeline, but that's not the same as criminal intent."

"But it's possible," Sophia said. "He could file charges. The prosecutor could accept them. I could actually be criminally charged for—for what? Supporting my boyfriend? Encouraging him to think for himself?"

"For being eighteen when he's seventeen. That's what Robert's weaponizing. The age difference."

"It's five months. I turned eighteen in February, he turns eighteen in August. Five months."

"I know, sweetheart. It's not fair. It's not right. But Robert's lawyers are good at finding technicalities."

Sophia wrapped her hands around the tea mug, seeking warmth. Her stomach churned too much for food. The kitchen smelled like toast and coffee—normal breakfast smells on the least normal morning of her life.

"What if MIT finds out?" she asked quietly. "What if they revoke my acceptance because I'm facing criminal charges?"

"You're not facing charges yet. And you might never face charges. This could be entirely bluff and intimidation."

"It doesn't feel like a bluff."

Helen was quiet for a moment. Then: "Are you still sure? About MIT? About Ethan? About all of it?"

Sophia looked at her mother—genuinely asking, not pressuring, giving her space to doubt.

"I'm sure about MIT," she said. "I've wanted this since I was fourteen. Engineering degree, research opportunities, everything."

"And Ethan?"

"I'm sure about him too. About supporting him. About us trying to make this work."

"Even if it costs you?"

Sophia thought about that. Really thought about it. Criminal charges. Court dates. Legal fees. Possible jail time. Criminal record. Everything she'd worked for put at risk.

"Yeah," she said finally. "Even then. Because what Robert's doing is wrong. And if I walk away now, I'm saying it's okay for parents to control their kids like this. I'm saying money and threats are enough to destroy someone's autonomy. And I can't—I can't live with that."

Her mother's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "That's very brave."

"That's very stupid."

"Both things can be true."

They sat in the kitchen as dawn brightened to full morning. At 7:30, Sophia's father came downstairs, already in lawyer mode—he'd been researching legal precedents until past midnight.

"Good morning," he said, then looked at Sophia. "Did you sleep?"

"Not really."

"Me neither." He poured coffee, joined them at the table. "I've been reviewing Romeo and Juliet laws—close-in-age exemptions for relationships involving minors. Michigan has one. So does Manitoba. In both jurisdictions, if you're within five years age difference and the younger party is above age of consent, it's legal. You and Ethan are five months apart, both above sixteen. Robert's criminal charges would have to prove more than just age difference."

"What would they have to prove?"

"That you intentionally interfered with his parental authority. That you encouraged illegal behavior—like truancy. That you maintained contact against explicit parental instructions. That's harder to prove, but possible if Robert has documentation."

"He has fourteen months of surveillance."

Michael's expression darkened. "Which is its own kind of disturbing. But surveillance of you and Ethan being together isn't the same as evidence of criminal intent. You'd need a very aggressive prosecutor to move forward with charges this weak."

"But it's possible."

"It's possible."

Sophia's phone buzzed. Ethan's text: "you awake?"

"yeah you?"

"couldn't sleep"

"is today really happening"

"today is really happening"

She put her phone down, looked at her parents. "Ethan and I are meeting at 3 PM to sign our commitment letters. Together. At The Forks. Where we reconnected in September."

"That's romantic," her mother said.

"That's terrifying," Sophia replied.

"Both things—" Helen started.

"—can be true," Sophia finished. "I know."

---

Meanwhile, two hundred miles southwest in Jordan's Winnipeg apartment, Ethan sat at the kitchen table staring at two documents on his laptop screen.

Left tab: MIT acceptance letter. Unsigned commitment form. Deadline: 11:59 PM tonight.

Right tab: Email from NHL Central Scouting. Final reminder about draft-eligible players. Commitment window closing May 5th.

11:59 PM. Fifteen hours and twelve minutes to decide his future.

The coffee in front of him was cold, third cup of a morning spent researching financial aid, emancipation procedures, backup plans. Jordan's apartment was quiet, his brother already at work, giving Ethan space to think.

His phone buzzed. Text from Sophia:

"you awake?"

"yeah you?"

"couldn't sleep"
"is today really happening"

"today is really happening"

"i'm scared"

"me too"

"what if we're making a mistake"

Ethan looked at the MIT letter. Everything he wanted. Everything he'd fought for.

"we're not," he typed. "this is right. we know it's right"

"then why am i terrified"

"because its real now. because theres no going back after today"

Pause. Then: "have you signed yet?"

"no. you?"

"no. keep staring at it"

"same"

"want to sign together? later?"

Ethan's chest tightened with something that felt like hope. "where?"

"the forks? 3pm? where we met when we were nine"

"ill be there"

"bring your decision letter. ill bring mine"

"deal"

The messages ended. Ethan closed his phone, looked back at the MIT acceptance.

National College Decision Day. May 1st. The day thousands of high school seniors across the country committed to their futures.

For most of them, it was exciting. Celebrating their choices, posting acceptance letters on social media, wearing college sweatshirts, planning dorm rooms.

For most of them, social media would be flooded today. Instagram posts with MIT graphics, "I'm going to..." captions, college decision TikToks, Snapchat geofilters at signing events. Friends commenting congratulations, parents posting proud parent moments, the whole performative celebration of college commitment day.

For Ethan, it meant none of that. No Instagram post. No celebration video. No college sweatshirt photos. His father monitored his social media obsessively, would screenshot anything as evidence, twist celebration into proof of defiance. Ethan's Instagram had been deactivated for weeks, one less way for Robert to track his life.

His commitment would be silent, private, shared only with Sophia and the MIT admissions portal.

The absence of performance didn't make it less real. If anything, it made it more his own.

For Ethan, it was choosing between two futures: one safe and funded by surrendering his autonomy, one uncertain and purchased with massive debt and legal battles.

He clicked over to his financial aid summary. If the emancipation hearing on May 15th went in his favor, MIT would cover everything. Full ride, room and board, fees. All of it.

If the hearing failed, he'd need $73,000 in loans just for the first year. Loan applications required co-signers. He had no one to ask.

Adult decisions, adult consequences.

He opened a new tab, started drafting an email to MIT financial aid. Subject: "Emancipation Pending - Aid Timeline Questions."

This was his life now. Navigating bureaucracy, legal proceedings, financial impossibilities. All because he wanted to choose his own path.

All because his father couldn't accept that path was different from his own.

---

Meanwhile, six hundred miles northeast in Winnipeg, Sophia sat at her desk with the same MIT acceptance letter open on her laptop.

Her parents were downstairs making breakfast, voices carrying up the stairs. Her badminton equipment was piled in the corner, gold medal from nationals hung on her wall where she could see it every morning.

National Champion.

MIT-bound.

If she could just sign the letter.

Her hand hovered over the touchpad, cursor on the "Submit Commitment" button.

One click. That's all it took. One click and she was officially committed to MIT, to Boston, to September, to Ethan, to everything they'd fought for.

But her father's words from last week echoed: "Robert's not done. Men like that don't accept losing. He'll escalate."

How much worse could it get?

Knock on her door. Her mother entered with tea, familiar morning ritual.

"You're up early," Helen said.

"Big day."

"MIT decision day."

"Yeah."

Helen sat on the edge of the bed. "You're still sure?"

"I'm sure. I'm just... processing."

"Processing the fight it took to get here?"

"Processing what comes next. Emancipation hearing in two weeks. Robert's threats. The money situation."

"We can help with money if needed."

"It's not your responsibility."

"You're my daughter. Of course it's my responsibility."

Sophia felt emotion tighten her throat. "I don't want this to cost you anything."

"Supporting you isn't a cost. It's a privilege."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment.

"Are you scared?" Helen asked.

"Terrified. Excited. Both."

"That sounds about right for MIT."

Sophia laughed, slightly shaky. "Ethan and I are meeting this afternoon. 3 PM at The Forks. We're going to sign our letters together."

Helen's expression was soft. "That's romantic."

"That's terrifying."

"Both things can be true."

After her mother left, Sophia pulled up the letter again. The "Submit Commitment" button waited, patient and final.

September in Boston. MIT. Ethan. Engineering and badminton and everything she'd dreamed about.

If they could survive the next two weeks.

She closed the laptop, checked the time. Six and a half hours until 3 PM.

Six and a half hours until everything became real.

---

The Forks at 2:50 PM was alive with spring energy—first truly warm day of May, winter finally releasing its grip on Manitoba. Families walked along the Red River, joggers on the paths, food trucks setting up for evening crowds. Trees showed early green, buds opening, everything promising renewal.

The water flowed with late snowmelt, ice long gone, river reflecting gray sky that threatened rain later but held off for now.

Ethan arrived first, Jordan dropping him off with promise to return at 5 PM. He stood on the pedestrian bridge where they'd stood in September, where everything had restarted.

Seven months ago, Sophia had appeared in the community center—unexpected, impossible, someone from his past who'd somehow become his future. Seven months of reconnection, complications, escalation. Seven months of fighting for the right to choose their own paths.

And now: decision day.

He pulled the printed MIT acceptance letter from his backpack. Heavy paper stock, official MIT letterhead, "We are pleased to offer you admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology" in formal typeface. The signature line at the bottom waited, blank, for his commitment.

One signature. That's all it took. His future, determined by his own hand instead of his father's plans.

The bridge had memorial plaques along the railing—Winnipeg history, significant dates, names of people who'd shaped the city. Ethan leaned against the railing, looking at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The Forks. Where two paths met and became something new.

Fitting place for this.

"Hey."

He turned. Sophia approached from the parking area, carrying a manila envelope, her expression nervous and determined simultaneously.

She was wearing her MIT sweatshirt—the one she'd ordered the day after getting accepted, gray with the MIT logo and "Class of 2030" on the back. Ethan had the same sweatshirt in his backpack, unworn, waiting for today to make it official.

"Hey." His voice came out rougher than intended.

They stood facing each other on the bridge, letters in hand, river flowing sixty feet below, Winnipeg spring happening around them while their futures hung in balance.

"This is really happening," Sophia said.

"This is really happening."

She glanced around—families passing by, joggers, normal people having normal Tuesday afternoons. "Should we sit?"

There was a bench nearby, weathered wood with a view of both rivers. The same bench, Ethan realized, where they'd sat at nine years old during hockey tournaments. Back when everything was simple—skating and competition and friendship uncomplicated by control and threats and impossible choices.

They sat there now, seventeen and eighteen, deciding futures that their families had tried to prevent.

Sophia pulled out her acceptance letter—identical to his, same letterhead, same formal language. Her hands trembled slightly as she held it.

"Are you scared?" she asked.

"Terrified. You?"

"Same." She looked at the signature line, blank and waiting. "This morning I had a nightmare that MIT revoked my acceptance. That the criminal charges went through and they sent me a letter: 'We regret to inform you...'"

"That's not going to happen."

"You don't know that."

"No," Ethan admitted. "But I know we're making the right choice. MIT, engineering, our own futures—that's right. Whatever happens with my father, with the emancipation hearing, with the threats—we're choosing what's right for us."

Sophia's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "What if it costs us everything?"

"Then we rebuild. Together."

Two identical letters in their hands. Two identical deadlines: 11:59 PM tonight. Two futures that had been separate for six years, now intertwining again.

"Are you sure?" Sophia asked quietly. "Really sure? Because once we sign, it's binding. No taking it back."

"Are you?"

"I asked first."

Ethan looked at the letter in his hands—heavy paper, official seal, words that represented everything he'd wanted since realizing engineering was possible, since understanding he could have a future beyond hockey.

"I'm sure," he said. "I want this. MIT, engineering, building my own life on my own terms. Research, innovation, maybe grad school, maybe startup companies—I don't know exactly what yet, but I know it starts here. And I want—" He paused, meeting her eyes. "I want to try this. Us. At MIT. See if what we have now can survive distance, can grow into something more. I'm sure."

"Even without your father's support? Even with the emancipation hearing and the financial uncertainty and all of it?"

"Especially without his support. That's the whole point. Choosing my own path instead of following the one he decided for me when I was five years old."

Sophia looked down at her own letter, reading words she'd memorized weeks ago. "My dad warned me Sunday night. After Toronto. He said your father will escalate, that men like that don't accept losing. He said it might get worse before it gets better."

"He already has escalated. Cut me off financially, showed up in Toronto, threatened criminal charges against you, sabotaged the emancipation case. I don't know what worse looks like."

"What if we lose?" Her voice was small. "What if the emancipation fails and you can't get financial aid? What if Robert actually files charges and I end up with a criminal record? What if MIT revokes our acceptances or we can't afford it or—"

"Then we handle it." Ethan took her hand, the one not holding her letter. "Together. We defer for a semester, we regroup, we find another path. But giving up now, letting him win without even trying—I can't live with that. Can you?"

Sophia was quiet, processing. River water flowing below them, spring breeze carrying the smell of thawing earth and new growth. Around them, Winnipeg continued—joggers, families, teenagers on skateboards, all the normal chaos of life happening while they decided their futures on a bridge in the middle of the city.

"No," she said finally. "I can't live with that either. I can't let Robert's threats determine my choices. That's exactly what he wants—for me to be so scared of consequences that I walk away, leaving Ethan isolated and alone. And I won't do it."

She looked at Ethan, determination replacing fear in her expression. "Okay. Together."

They opened their letters simultaneously, though they'd both already memorized every word.

"On three?" Sophia said, pulling a pen from her bag—MIT blue ink, of course, purchased specifically for this moment.

"On three." Ethan had his own pen ready, black ink, ordinary, borrowed from Jordan's kitchen counter this morning.

"One."

Ethan's hand trembled slightly as he positioned his pen above the signature line. His handwriting would commit him to MIT, to engineering, to a future built on massive debt and legal uncertainty and hope that the emancipation hearing would succeed. His signature, his choice, his future.

"Two."

Sophia's eyes met his across the bench, both of them on the edge of something irreversible. Her hand was shaking too, pen hovering, breath held.

Around them, Winnipeg was beautiful—spring afternoon, river flowing, sky clearing, everything promising possibility.

"Three."

They signed.

Ethan Price, his signature taking longer than usual because his hand was shaking, because the weight of the moment made the pen feel heavy, because this was everything.

Sophia Chen, her signature slanting slightly upward the way it always did when she was emotional, her face bright with determination and terror and hope all at once.

For three seconds, they just sat there. Holding their signed letters. Staring at their own handwriting committing them to futures Robert had tried to prevent, to paths they'd chosen despite threats, to MIT together against all odds.

The letters felt different now. Heavier. More real.

Binding.

"Done," Ethan said, voice rough with emotion he was trying to control.

"Done," Sophia echoed, and her voice broke on the word.

Then she was crying—happy tears, overwhelmed tears, relief and fear and joy all mixed together. Ethan pulled her against him, both of them still holding their letters, and she pressed her face into his shoulder while her whole body shook.

"We did it," she said into his jacket. "We actually did it."

"We did it." Ethan's own eyes were burning. He blinked hard, not quite crying, but close.

They pulled up MIT's commitment portal on their phones with fumbling fingers. Uploaded photos of the signed letters. Hovered over "Submit."

"Together?" she asked.

"Together."

They pressed submit simultaneously.

Loading icon spinning. Ethan's heart hammered. This was it. Official. Binding. No taking it back after this.

Then his screen refreshed: "COMMITMENT RECEIVED - Ethan Price, Class of 2030."

And hers: "COMMITMENT RECEIVED - Sophia Chen, Class of 2030."

Sophia made a sound between a laugh and a sob. "We did it."

"We actually did it." Ethan felt something break loose in his chest—relief, disbelief, overwhelming joy threatening to crack him open. "September in Cambridge. Both of us."

She was crying, he realized. Happy tears running down her face, and she was laughing at the same time, overwhelmed and relieved and terrified all at once. Then she was in his arms and he was holding her tight, both of them shaking with the magnitude of what they'd just done.

"We're going to MIT," she said into his shoulder, words muffled but joyful.

"We're going to MIT," he confirmed, and his own voice cracked.

They pulled apart, both grinning despite wet eyes, despite everything. And then they were kissing—brief but meaningful, sealing the commitment with more than just signatures. Seventeen and eighteen years old, choosing their futures on a bridge over the Red River, making promises they intended to keep.

When they broke apart, Ethan kept his forehead pressed to hers, both of them breathing hard, still processing reality.

"I can't believe we did it," Sophia whispered.

"Believe it." He pulled back, showed her his phone screen again. Her name. His name. Class of 2030. Official. Binding. Real. "It's done."

Sophia looked at her own phone, the confirmation screen glowing. Then she glanced at her Instagram notifications—still muted from the morning, but the badge showed 127 unread. She opened it briefly.

Her feed was flooded with college decision posts. Friends from school, teammates from badminton, people she'd competed against over the years. Everyone posting their commitment photos: acceptance letters, college sweatshirts, graphics with university logos and "I'm going to..." captions.

Normal kids making normal posts about normal college decisions.

#DecisionDay trending. #MIT2030 showing dozens of posts from students across the world. Everyone celebrating, everyone excited, everyone's futures looking bright and uncomplicated.

Sophia could post her commitment. Could share her acceptance letter, could add to the #MIT2030 feed, could participate in the collective celebration happening across social media.

But Robert monitored everything. A public post would give him more ammunition, more evidence of "defiance," more fuel for whatever he was planning.

So she saved the confirmation screenshot to her camera roll—private archive, not public celebration—and put her phone away.

"You're not posting?" Ethan asked quietly. He'd seen her scroll through the Decision Day posts.

"Are you?"

He shook his head. "My Instagram's been deactivated for weeks. One less thing for my father to weaponize."

"Same reasoning. I want to post. I want to celebrate like everyone else. But—"

"But we can't. Not without consequences."

"Yeah."

They sat there, commitment letters in hand, official MIT confirmations on their phones, unable to share the moment the way their peers were sharing theirs.

Silent celebration. Private victory.

Another cost of choosing their own paths.

They sat there, hands clasped, commitment letters between them, both overwhelmed by what had just become official.

Against everything. Against his father's threats and financial control and psychiatric evaluations and isolation.

They'd chosen their own future.

Together.

"What now?" she asked.

"Now we survive the next two weeks until emancipation hearing. Then I get official financial independence, apply for full aid, and figure out logistics."

"That simple?"

"That complicated."

"And if the hearing doesn't go your way?"

"Then I file again at eighteen. My birthday's August 29th. Worst case, I defer MIT for a semester and file as a legal adult."

"You've really thought this through."

"I've had to."

They walked along the river, hands linked, discussing plans. Housing in Boston, course selection, move logistics. The conversation felt surreal—planning a future that yesterday had been uncertain, today was committed.

At 4:30, Jordan texted: "Ready for pickup?"

"Not yet. Few more minutes."

They found a café near the river, ordered coffee, sat in a corner booth away from other customers.

"Two weeks," Sophia said. "May 15th."

"I know."

"Are you nervous?"

"Terrified."

"What if he brings more evidence? More pressure?"

"Then I present my case. Dr. Martinez's evaluation. Financial records showing he cut me off. Proof that I can support myself independently."

"Can you? Support yourself independently?"

Ethan paused. "I'm staying with Jordan now. That's not permanent. I need to find summer work, save money, apply for financial aid. It's going to be tight. But possible."

"My dad could help—"

"No." Ethan's voice was firm. "I can't take help from your family. That feeds into my father's manipulation narrative. I need to prove independence, not trade one dependency for another."

"That's not fair."

"It's strategic. If I want the emancipation to hold, I need to demonstrate I'm self-sufficient."

Sophia stirred her coffee, thinking. "After the hearing. After you're officially emancipated. Then we can talk about practical help."

"Maybe."

"Definitely. You're not doing this completely alone."

"I have Jordan."

"You have me too."

Their eyes met across the table. The weight of what they'd chosen settling over them.

"September," Ethan said. "MIT. Fresh start."

"No more Robert controlling everything."

"No more isolation and monitored calls."

"Just us and engineering and Boston."

"And badminton. You'll play for MIT's team."

"And hockey. You'll find a club team."

"Maybe."

"Definitely."

They stayed in the café until 5 PM, planning and dreaming and avoiding thinking about the next two weeks. When Jordan texted again, they reluctantly left.

Outside, Jordan's car idled at the curb. Sophia walked Ethan to it, goodbye hug that lasted a beat too long.

"See you soon," she said.

"Two weeks."

"We can do this."

"We can do this."

Ethan climbed into Jordan's car, watched Sophia wave as they pulled away.

"MIT?" Jordan asked.

"MIT. Both of us. Signed and submitted."

"That's huge. Congratulations."

"Thanks."

"Now you just have to survive the emancipation hearing."

"Now I just have to survive the emancipation hearing."

They drove toward Jordan's apartment, traffic light, sky darkening toward evening. Ethan checked his phone—confirmation email from MIT, welcoming him to the class of 2030, outlining next steps.

Everything he'd wanted. Everything he'd fought for.

Now he just had to hold onto it.

---

7:43 PM. Ethan was at Jordan's apartment making dinner when Jordan's phone rang. Their father's name on the screen.

"Don't answer," Ethan said.

Jordan declined the call. Thirty seconds later, the phone rang again.

"He's persistent," Jordan said.

The call went to voicemail. Jordan put the phone on the counter, and they heard the message play on speaker.

"Jordan, this is your father. I know Ethan is with you. Tell him I need to see him. Tonight. At the house. It's important. Not negotiable."

The message ended.

"Absolutely not," Ethan said.

"Agreed."

"It's a trap. He wants to pressure me about MIT."

"Probably."

But five minutes later, another call. This time, a text: "I'm coming to your apartment. Be there in fifteen minutes. We need to talk."

"He's coming here?" Ethan's chest tightened.

"This is my place. He can't force entry."

"He's your father."

"He's not my landlord."

Thirteen minutes later, knock on the door. Jordan checked the peephole, confirmed it was their father.

"Don't open it," Ethan said.

Jordan cracked the door, chain lock engaged. "Dad."

"I need to speak with Ethan."

"He doesn't want to speak with you."

"It's not optional. This is important."

"Everything's important to you. That doesn't make it mandatory."

Their father's patience frayed. "Jordan, this is serious. Open the door."

"No."

"I'm your father."

"And this is my apartment. You're not invited."

Ethan stepped into view behind Jordan. "What do you want?"

His father's expression was controlled, dangerous calm. "I want you to come home. Both of you. We need to talk. As a family."

"We don't have anything to talk about."

"You signed MIT today. Against my advice, against your best interests. That has consequences."

"I know. You've made that clear."

"You don't know. Not yet. But you will. Come home. Hear me out."

"I'm not coming home. I don't live there anymore."

"You're seventeen. You live where I say you live."

"Actually, I live where Jordan lets me live. You cut me off financially, remember? Made me independent."

His father's jaw tightened. "The emancipation hearing is May 15th. Two weeks. You think you're going to win?"

"Dr. Martinez recommended it proceed."

"One evaluation. I have fourteen months of documentation. Every boundary you've crossed, every lie you've told, every time you've chosen Sophia over family. The court will see a teenager making terrible decisions, influenced by someone who doesn't have his best interests at heart."

"The court will see a young adult making autonomous choices about his future."

"We'll see. May 15th. Courthouse. 10 AM. Be ready."

His father turned to leave, then stopped. "One more thing. Come to the house tomorrow. Noon. There's something you need to see. Something about your case. About her."

"I'm not playing your games."

"It's not a game. It's evidence. Evidence the court will see if you don't see it first."

"What evidence?"

"Tomorrow. Noon. Come alone."

Then he was gone, footsteps receding down the hall.

Jordan closed the door, locked it. "That was ominous."

"He's bluffing."

"Maybe."

"What evidence could he possibly have?"

"I don't know. But he sounded confident."

Ethan pulled out his phone, started texting Sophia. Then stopped. What would he even say? "My dad has mysterious evidence about you?"

Jordan noticed. "You should tell her."

"Tell her what? That my dad is threatening something vague?"

"That something's coming. She should be prepared."

Ethan stared at his phone, cursor blinking in an empty message. Finally he typed: "My dad wants to meet tomorrow. Says he has evidence about the case. I don't know what it is."

Her response came quickly: "Evidence about what?"

"He said about you. About us. I don't know details."

"Should we be worried?"

"I don't know."

"Let me know what happens."

"I will."

But Ethan felt unease settling in his chest. His father didn't make empty threats. If he said there was evidence, there was evidence.

The question was: evidence of what?

---

May 2nd, 11:47 AM. Ethan stood outside his father's house—former home, now enemy territory—debating whether to go inside.

Jordan had offered to come, but Ethan refused. This was between him and his father.

He knocked. His father answered immediately, like he'd been waiting.

"Come in."

The house smelled the same, looked the same, felt completely foreign. Ethan followed his father to the office, the room where so many battles had been fought.

Two men were already there, the same professionals from Toronto. Lawyer and investigator, Ethan guessed.

"Sit," his father said.

Ethan sat. The three men remained standing, dominant position.

On the desk: folders, documents, photographs.

"You signed MIT yesterday," his father said. "Committed to a future based on a relationship I believe is unhealthy and manipulative."

"We've had this argument."

"We have. But you've never seen the full picture. The evidence I've been gathering since last March. Fourteen months of documentation."

He opened the first folder. Photographs spilled out.

Ethan recognized them immediately. Him and Sophia at the science fair. At hockey games. At coffee shops. At the park near school.

"You've been following us."

"I've been documenting concerning behavior."

More photos. Them studying together. Her at his games. Him at her tournaments. Every moment of their relationship, catalogued.

"This is stalking."

"This is parenting. Monitoring a minor child's relationships."

The investigator spoke for the first time. "We've been documenting since March of last year. Phone records, location data, social media, witness statements. Creating a complete picture of the relationship timeline."

"A relationship isn't a crime."

"No," his father said. "But there are concerning patterns."

He opened the second folder. Emails. Printed conversations between Ethan and Sophia about meeting after school, avoiding his father's restrictions, planning around supervision.

"Every time you lied about your location. Every time you met her against my instructions. Every time she facilitated contact that violated boundaries I'd set as your parent."

"Those boundaries were unreasonable."

"They were parental authority. She helped you violate them."

The third folder: text messages. Months of conversations between Ethan and Sophia, including messages about the emancipation, about fighting his father's control, about plans to attend MIT together.

"She encouraged emancipation," his father said. "Encouraged you to defy me, to fight for what she called 'freedom' but what I call manipulation."

"She encouraged me to think for myself."

"She encouraged a minor to rebel against his parent."

The fourth folder: school records. Ethan's attendance, showing days he'd missed, classes he'd skipped. Cross-referenced with location data showing him with Sophia during those times.

"Truancy," the lawyer said. "Facilitated by an adult who knew he should be in school."

"She's seventeen too. Same age as me."

"She turned eighteen in February," his father said. "She's been a legal adult for two and a half months. You're still a minor for three more months."

The words landed like a punch.

Ethan hadn't realized. Sophia's birthday had passed during the worst of the isolation, unnoticed in the chaos of provincial championships and emancipation filing.

She was eighteen. He was seventeen.

"So what?" Ethan said. "Two months difference doesn't change anything."

"It changes the legal framework," the lawyer said. "An adult in a relationship with a minor, encouraging that minor to defy parental authority, facilitating truancy, maintaining contact against parental instruction—that's legally significant."

"We didn't do anything wrong."

"You did many things wrong. The question is whether she broke the law."

The fifth folder. Legal documents. Statutes, case law, precedents.

The lawyer walked Ethan through them:

Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. When an adult encourages illegal behavior (like truancy) in a minor. Up to six months jail time.

Interference with custody. When someone interferes with a parent's legal right to control their minor child's activities and relationships. Can be escalated to felony. Up to two years.

Criminal harassment under Canadian law. Maintaining unwanted contact with a family member of someone who's set boundaries. Fines and possible jail time.

"These are all potential charges," the lawyer said. "Based on the documented evidence."

Ethan's blood went cold. His hands started shaking. He had to set down the folder he was holding before he dropped it.

"You're going to press charges against Sophia." His voice came out hollow, disbelieving.

"I'm going to protect my son," his father said. "From someone who's been manipulating him for fourteen months. Someone who encouraged rebellion, defiance, legal action against his family."

"She didn't manipulate me. She supported my choices."

"Choices that aligned with her goals. MIT together. Emancipation that would free you from my influence. Every decision pushing you toward her future, away from yours."

"MIT is my future. Engineering is my future."

"You wanted both until she came back. Then suddenly hockey was the enemy, I was the enemy, everything that wasn't her was the enemy."

"That's not true."

"The evidence says otherwise."

His father laid out the final folder. A legal document, formal and typed, signatures ready at the bottom.

"Criminal complaint," the lawyer explained. "Detailing the charges against Sophia Chen. Contributing to delinquency, interference with custody, harassment. Based on fourteen months of documented evidence."

Ethan tried to read the complaint, but the words blurred together into nightmare reality. His hands were trembling so badly the pages shook.

Sophia. Criminal charges. Prison time. Criminal record. MIT revoked. Engineering career destroyed.

All because she'd supported him.

"These will be filed with the prosecutor's office on May 14th," his father said. "The day before your emancipation hearing. The prosecutor will review and decide whether to press charges. Given the documentation, I'm confident they will."

Nausea hit him hard and sudden. Ethan stood up too fast, the room tilting.

"You can't do this." His voice cracked.

"I can. And I will. Unless."

There it was. The trap.

"Unless what?"

"Unless Sophia ends all contact with you. Permanently. Documented in writing, legally binding. She stays in Winnipeg, you stay in Michigan. She goes to Toronto for university, you reconsider MIT. No contact, no relationship, no influence."

"I'm going to MIT. We signed yesterday."

"MIT accepts deferrals. Take a gap year, revisit the decision when you're eighteen and legally independent."

"I'm not doing that."

"Then she faces criminal charges. Contributing to delinquency is a misdemeanor, up to six months jail time. Interference with custody can be a felony, up to two years. Harassment is misdemeanor, fines and possible jail time. Even if she's not convicted, a criminal record follows you forever. She wants to be an engineer? Many employers won't hire someone with a criminal record, especially in fields requiring security clearances."

The words kept landing, each one worse than the last.

"This is insane."

"This is protective. I'm protecting you from someone who's been manipulating you for over a year."

"She hasn't manipulated me!"

"The court will decide that at the emancipation hearing. But the criminal charges are separate. Those go to the prosecutor. Based on this evidence, Sophia faces real legal jeopardy."

Ethan looked at the photographs, the emails, the texts. Fourteen months of their relationship, weaponized.

"You're saying drop MIT and her, or she goes to jail."

"I'm saying she ends contact, or she faces the legal consequences of her actions."

"Her actions were supporting me."

"Her actions were interfering with my parental authority over a minor child."

The investigator spoke again. "The deadline is May 15th, 9 AM. One hour before the emancipation hearing. If Sophia provides written statement ending all contact, permanently and irrevocably, the charges won't be filed. If she doesn't, the complaint goes to the prosecutor's office at 10 AM, during your hearing."

"So during the hearing, while I'm fighting for emancipation, she's being charged with crimes."

"Correct."

"And if I withdraw the emancipation petition?"

His father's expression didn't change. "The charges still proceed unless she ends contact. This isn't about the emancipation anymore. This is about protecting you from someone who's been a negative influence for fourteen months."

"This is about control."

"This is about consequences."

Ethan stood, legs unsteady. "I need to tell her."

"Yes," his father said. "You do. Tell her she has thirteen days. May 15th, 9 AM. Written statement ending all contact, or criminal charges. Her choice."

"This is blackmail."

"This is parenting."

"This is abuse."

"This is love. I'm trying to save you from making mistakes that will haunt you for the rest of your life."

Ethan looked at his father—the man who'd raised him, trained him, shaped his entire childhood—and saw a stranger. Someone so convinced of his righteousness that he'd destroy a teenage girl's future to maintain control.

"You're going to lose me," Ethan said quietly. "Whether emancipation happens or not, whether she ends contact or not, you're going to lose me. Because I'll never forgive this."

"You'll understand when you're older."

"I understand now. I understand you'd rather destroy us both than accept that I want something different than what you want for me."

His father didn't respond.

Ethan left the office, walked through the house that used to be home, stepped outside into cold spring air.

Thirteen days.

May 15th, 9 AM.

Sophia had to choose: end things permanently and let him face emancipation alone, or maintain contact and face criminal charges that could destroy her future.

Either way, his father won.

Either way, they lost.

Ethan pulled out his phone, hands shaking so badly he almost dropped it. This news was too big for text, too devastating for typing.

He called Sophia.

She answered on the second ring, voice bright—probably still riding the high of committing to MIT together three hours ago. "Hey! I was just looking at dorm options—"

"We need to talk." His voice came out flat, dead. "In person. As soon as possible."

Silence. Then, carefully: "What happened?"

"Not on the phone. Can you meet me? The Forks. One hour."

"Ethan, you're scaring me."

"I know. I'm sorry. Just—please. One hour."

"I'll be there."

The call ended.

Ethan stood on the sidewalk outside his father's house—former home, now enemy territory—and tried to steady his breathing.

Fourteen months of surveillance. Photographs of them together. Text messages encouraging emancipation. School records showing truancy. Location data. All of it weaponized, all of it twisted into evidence of manipulation instead of support, criminal intent instead of care.

And the legal documents. Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Interference with custody. Harassment. Charges that could mean jail time, criminal record, MIT revoked, engineering career destroyed before it started.

All because Sophia had turned eighteen in February while he was still seventeen until August.

Five months. That's all the difference was. Five months of age gap that Robert's lawyers had found a way to weaponize.

Ethan started walking. Didn't call Jordan for a ride, needed the movement to process the nightmare his father had just unveiled. Michigan streets quiet in late afternoon, spring evening settling in, everything looking normal while his world imploded.

An hour later, he stood on the same bridge where they'd signed their MIT letters that afternoon. The bench where they'd committed to their futures together, celebrating in private because public celebration would cost too much.

Now even private celebration was poisoned.

Sophia appeared at 4:47 PM, out of breath from running. She'd changed out of her MIT sweatshirt into a hoodie, hair pulled back, face showing worry that turned to fear when she saw his expression.

"What happened?" she asked immediately. "What did your father do?"

Ethan handed her the folder. Five sections. Fourteen months of documentation. Legal statutes. Proposed criminal charges.

She read in silence, face going progressively paler, until she had to sit down on the bench. The same bench where they'd signed their futures three hours ago.

"Criminal charges," she said finally, voice hollow. "He's actually going to file criminal charges against me."

"Unless you end all contact. Permanently. Written statement, legally binding. Due May 15th at 9 AM—one hour before the emancipation hearing."

"So during your hearing, I'll be—what? Signing away our relationship? Or being charged with crimes?"

"That's the choice he's giving you."

Sophia stared at the legal documents. Her hands trembled holding them. "Contributing to delinquency. Interference with custody. Harassment. I could go to jail. I could have a criminal record. MIT could revoke my acceptance—"

Her voice broke. She pressed a hand to her mouth, eyes wide with horror.

"We just signed our commitment letters," she whispered. "Four hours ago. We committed to MIT together. And now—"

"Now he's found a way to destroy that." Ethan sat beside her, feeling numb. "Unless you walk away. Unless you sign the statement ending all contact, leaving me to face the emancipation hearing alone."

"And if I don't sign?"

"Criminal charges filed May 15th. Prosecutor reviews. With Robert's documentation, they'll probably accept the case. You'd need a criminal defense attorney, court dates, legal fees. Even if you win, the record follows you. Background checks for jobs, security clearances for engineering positions—all of it affected."

"Because I'm eighteen and you're seventeen."

"Because you're eighteen and I'm seventeen and he has fourteen months of surveillance proving you encouraged me to defy him."

Sophia looked at the documents in her lap. At the bench where they'd signed their futures. At the river flowing below. At Ethan, sitting beside her, both of them seventeen and eighteen years old and facing choices no one their age should face.

"We committed to MIT today," she said. "Together. Class of 2030."

"I know."

"And now he's saying I have to choose between that future and—and you. Between my entire life and supporting you."

"That's what he's saying."

Sophia's eyes were bright with tears she was fighting. "What do we do?"

"I don't know."

"Thirteen days until May 15th."

"Thirteen days."

Her phone buzzed. Instagram notification: someone congratulating her on the national championship, asking if she'd decided on college yet. Normal question, normal conversation, normal life continuing around them while theirs crumbled.

She turned off her phone completely.

They sat on the bench as evening shadows lengthened, commitment letters to MIT signed and submitted, criminal charges looming in thirteen days.

"We did it," Sophia said finally, voice bitter. "We chose our own futures. We committed to MIT. We signed the letters four hours ago."

"Four hours ago," Ethan echoed.

"And now it might all be for nothing."

Ethan took her hand. It was shaking. "We'll figure it out. We have to."

"How? How do we figure out a choice between criminal charges and abandoning you?"

"I don't know yet. But we have thirteen days. Maybe—maybe your dad can help. He's a lawyer, he understands—"

Sophia's phone rang, cutting him off. Michael Chen's name on the screen.

She answered, put it on speaker. Her father's voice was tense, urgent: "Sophia, where are you?"

"At The Forks. With Ethan. Why?"

"Robert's attorney just called me. Courtesy notification that criminal complaints have been drafted and will be filed May 15th unless you sign the termination of contact. He wanted me to know that he's offering one opportunity for you to consult legal counsel before making your decision."

"Dad, what do I do?"

Michael was quiet for a long moment. "Come home. We need to talk. All of us. This is serious, sweetheart. More serious than I feared."

"How serious?"

"Come home. Now. Please."

The call ended.

Sophia and Ethan sat on the bench in deepening twilight, their MIT commitment letters signed and official, their futures together committed, and Robert's criminal charges looming like a countdown timer.

May 15th.

Thirteen days.

The choice impossible, the consequences devastating either way.

And somewhere in Michigan, Robert Price was waiting, confident that Sophia would choose self-preservation over supporting Ethan.

That fear would win over love.

That threats would succeed where control had failed.

The countdown had begun.

And everything they'd fought for hung in the balance.
