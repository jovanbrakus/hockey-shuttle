# CHAPTER 4: SIGNING DAY

May 1st, 8:47 AM. Ethan sat at the kitchen table in Jordan's apartment—his new temporary home since his father's Toronto ultimatum—staring at two documents on his laptop screen.

Left tab: MIT acceptance letter. Unsigned commitment form. Deadline: 11:59 PM tonight.

Right tab: Email from NHL Central Scouting. Final reminder about draft-eligible players. Commitment window closing May 5th.

11:59 PM. Fifteen hours and twelve minutes to decide his future.

The coffee in front of him was cold, third cup of a morning spent researching financial aid, emancipation procedures, backup plans. Jordan's apartment was quiet, his brother already at work, giving Ethan space to think.

His phone buzzed. Text from Sophia:

"you awake?"

"yeah you?"

"couldn't sleep"
"is today really happening"

"today is really happening"

"i'm scared"

"me too"

"what if we're making a mistake"

Ethan looked at the MIT letter. Everything he wanted. Everything he'd fought for.

"we're not," he typed. "this is right. we know it's right"

"then why am i terrified"

"because its real now. because theres no going back after today"

Pause. Then: "have you signed yet?"

"no. you?"

"no. keep staring at it"

"same"

"want to sign together? later?"

Ethan's chest tightened with something that felt like hope. "where?"

"the forks? 3pm? where we met when we were nine"

"ill be there"

"bring your decision letter. ill bring mine"

"deal"

The messages ended. Ethan closed his phone, looked back at the MIT acceptance.

National College Decision Day. May 1st. The day thousands of high school seniors across the country committed to their futures.

For most of them, it was exciting. Celebrating their choices, posting acceptance letters on social media, wearing college sweatshirts, planning dorm rooms.

For most of them, social media would be flooded today. Instagram posts with MIT graphics, "I'm going to..." captions, college decision TikToks, Snapchat geofilters at signing events. Friends commenting congratulations, parents posting proud parent moments, the whole performative celebration of college commitment day.

For Ethan, it meant none of that. No Instagram post. No celebration video. No college sweatshirt photos. His father monitored his social media obsessively, would screenshot anything as evidence, twist celebration into proof of defiance. Ethan's Instagram had been deactivated for weeks, one less way for Robert to track his life.

His commitment would be silent, private, shared only with Sophia and the MIT admissions portal.

The absence of performance didn't make it less real. If anything, it made it more his own.

For Ethan, it was choosing between two futures: one safe and funded by surrendering his autonomy, one uncertain and purchased with massive debt and legal battles.

He clicked over to his financial aid summary. If the emancipation hearing on May 15th went in his favor, MIT would cover everything. Full ride, room and board, fees. All of it.

If the hearing failed, he'd need $73,000 in loans just for the first year. Loan applications required co-signers. He had no one to ask.

Adult decisions, adult consequences.

He opened a new tab, started drafting an email to MIT financial aid. Subject: "Emancipation Pending - Aid Timeline Questions."

This was his life now. Navigating bureaucracy, legal proceedings, financial impossibilities. All because he wanted to choose his own path.

All because his father couldn't accept that path was different from his own.

Meanwhile, six hundred miles northeast in Winnipeg, Sophia sat at her desk with the same MIT acceptance letter open on her laptop.

Her parents were downstairs making breakfast, voices carrying up the stairs. Her badminton equipment was piled in the corner, gold medal from nationals hung on her wall where she could see it every morning.

National Champion.

MIT-bound.

If she could just sign the letter.

Her hand hovered over the touchpad, cursor on the "Submit Commitment" button.

One click. That's all it took. One click and she was officially committed to MIT, to Boston, to September, to Ethan, to everything they'd fought for.

But her father's words from last week echoed: "Robert's not done. Men like that don't accept losing. He'll escalate."

How much worse could it get?

Knock on her door. Her mother entered with tea, familiar morning ritual.

"You're up early," Helen said.

"Big day."

"MIT decision day."

"Yeah."

Helen sat on the edge of the bed. "You're still sure?"

"I'm sure. I'm just... processing."

"Processing the fight it took to get here?"

"Processing what comes next. Emancipation hearing in two weeks. Robert's threats. The money situation."

"We can help with money if needed."

"It's not your responsibility."

"You're my daughter. Of course it's my responsibility."

Sophia felt emotion tighten her throat. "I don't want this to cost you anything."

"Supporting you isn't a cost. It's a privilege."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment.

"Are you scared?" Helen asked.

"Terrified. Excited. Both."

"That sounds about right for MIT."

Sophia laughed, slightly shaky. "Ethan and I are meeting this afternoon. 3 PM at The Forks. We're going to sign our letters together."

Helen's expression was soft. "That's romantic."

"That's terrifying."

"Both things can be true."

After her mother left, Sophia pulled up the letter again. The "Submit Commitment" button waited, patient and final.

September in Boston. MIT. Ethan. Engineering and badminton and everything she'd dreamed about.

If they could survive the next two weeks.

She closed the laptop, checked the time. Six and a half hours until 3 PM.

Six and a half hours until everything became real.

---

The Forks at 2:50 PM was alive with spring energy. Families walking along the river, joggers on the paths, food trucks setting up for evening crowds. The Red River flowed with snowmelt, ice long gone, water reflecting gray sky.

Ethan arrived first, Jordan dropping him off with promise to return at 5 PM. He stood on the bridge where they'd stood in September, where everything had started again.

Seven months ago, Sophia had appeared in the community center, unexpected and impossible. Seven months of reconnection, complications, escalation, battle.

Now they were here. Decision day.

He pulled the printed MIT acceptance letter from his backpack, still unsigned. The paper felt weighted, significant beyond its physical mass.

"Hey."

He turned. Sophia approached from the parking area, carrying her own envelope.

"Hey."

They stood facing each other, letters in hand, river flowing behind them.

"This is really happening," she said.

"This is really happening."

"Should we sit?"

There was a bench nearby, same bench they'd sat on at nine years old, talking about hockey and skating and everything being simple. They sat there now, seventeen and complicated and deciding their futures.

Sophia pulled out her acceptance letter, still unsigned.

Ethan did the same.

Two identical letters, two identical deadlines, two intertwined futures.

"Are you sure?" she asked.

"Are you?"

"I asked first."

Ethan looked at the letter, all the MIT letterhead and formal language and "We are pleased to offer you admission."

"I'm sure," he said. "I want this. I want MIT, I want engineering, I want to build my own life. I want you. All of it. I'm sure."

"Even without your father's support?"

"Especially without his support. That's the whole point."

Sophia was quiet for a moment. "My dad warned me. Last week. He said your father will escalate."

"He already has. Cut me off financially, showed up in Toronto, threatened the emancipation case."

"What if it gets worse?"

"Then we handle it."

"Together?"

"Together."

She nodded, decision made. "Okay. Together."

They opened their letters simultaneously, reading through the acceptance text they'd both already memorized.

"On three?" Sophia said, pen ready.

"On three."

"One."

"Two."

"Three."

They signed. Ethan Price on his letter, Sophia Chen on hers. Signatures that would appear in MIT's system, confirm their enrollment, commit them to September.

"Done," Ethan said.

"Done," Sophia echoed.

They pulled up MIT's commitment portal on their phones, uploaded photos of the signed letters, submitted.

Loading icon spinning.

Then: "COMMITMENT RECEIVED - Ethan Price, Class of 2030."

And: "COMMITMENT RECEIVED - Sophia Chen, Class of 2030."

Official. Binding. Real.

They looked at each other, and Sophia started laughing, relief and disbelief and joy.

"We did it."

"We actually did it."

"September in Cambridge."

"Both of us."

Ethan pulled her into a hug, fierce and celebrating and victorious. Against odds, against pressure, against his father's control, they'd chosen their own path.

"MIT," Sophia said into his shoulder.

"MIT," he confirmed.

They pulled apart, both smiling, both overwhelmed.

"What now?" she asked.

"Now we survive the next two weeks until emancipation hearing. Then I get official financial independence, apply for full aid, and figure out logistics."

"That simple?"

"That complicated."

"And if the hearing doesn't go your way?"

"Then I file again at eighteen. My birthday's August 29th. Worst case, I defer MIT for a semester and file as a legal adult."

"You've really thought this through."

"I've had to."

They walked along the river, hands linked, discussing plans. Housing in Boston, course selection, move logistics. The conversation felt surreal—planning a future that yesterday had been uncertain, today was committed.

At 4:30, Jordan texted: "Ready for pickup?"

"Not yet. Few more minutes."

They found a café near the river, ordered coffee, sat in a corner booth away from other customers.

"Two weeks," Sophia said. "May 15th."

"I know."

"Are you nervous?"

"Terrified."

"What if he brings more evidence? More pressure?"

"Then I present my case. Dr. Martinez's evaluation. Financial records showing he cut me off. Proof that I can support myself independently."

"Can you? Support yourself independently?"

Ethan paused. "I'm staying with Jordan now. That's not permanent. I need to find summer work, save money, apply for financial aid. It's going to be tight. But possible."

"My dad could help—"

"No." Ethan's voice was firm. "I can't take help from your family. That feeds into my father's manipulation narrative. I need to prove independence, not trade one dependency for another."

"That's not fair."

"It's strategic. If I want the emancipation to hold, I need to demonstrate I'm self-sufficient."

Sophia stirred her coffee, thinking. "After the hearing. After you're officially emancipated. Then we can talk about practical help."

"Maybe."

"Definitely. You're not doing this completely alone."

"I have Jordan."

"You have me too."

Their eyes met across the table. The weight of what they'd chosen settling over them.

"September," Ethan said. "MIT. Fresh start."

"No more Robert controlling everything."

"No more isolation and monitored calls."

"Just us and engineering and Boston."

"And badminton. You'll play for MIT's team."

"And hockey. You'll find a club team."

"Maybe."

"Definitely."

They stayed in the café until 5 PM, planning and dreaming and avoiding thinking about the next two weeks. When Jordan texted again, they reluctantly left.

Outside, Jordan's car idled at the curb. Sophia walked Ethan to it, goodbye hug that lasted a beat too long.

"See you soon," she said.

"Two weeks."

"We can do this."

"We can do this."

Ethan climbed into Jordan's car, watched Sophia wave as they pulled away.

"MIT?" Jordan asked.

"MIT. Both of us. Signed and submitted."

"That's huge. Congratulations."

"Thanks."

"Now you just have to survive the emancipation hearing."

"Now I just have to survive the emancipation hearing."

They drove toward Jordan's apartment, traffic light, sky darkening toward evening. Ethan checked his phone—confirmation email from MIT, welcoming him to the class of 2030, outlining next steps.

Everything he'd wanted. Everything he'd fought for.

Now he just had to hold onto it.

---

7:43 PM. Ethan was at Jordan's apartment making dinner when Jordan's phone rang. Their father's name on the screen.

"Don't answer," Ethan said.

Jordan declined the call. Thirty seconds later, the phone rang again.

"He's persistent," Jordan said.

The call went to voicemail. Jordan put the phone on the counter, and they heard the message play on speaker.

"Jordan, this is your father. I know Ethan is with you. Tell him I need to see him. Tonight. At the house. It's important. Not negotiable."

The message ended.

"Absolutely not," Ethan said.

"Agreed."

"It's a trap. He wants to pressure me about MIT."

"Probably."

But five minutes later, another call. This time, a text: "I'm coming to your apartment. Be there in fifteen minutes. We need to talk."

"He's coming here?" Ethan's chest tightened.

"This is my place. He can't force entry."

"He's your father."

"He's not my landlord."

Thirteen minutes later, knock on the door. Jordan checked the peephole, confirmed it was their father.

"Don't open it," Ethan said.

Jordan cracked the door, chain lock engaged. "Dad."

"I need to speak with Ethan."

"He doesn't want to speak with you."

"It's not optional. This is important."

"Everything's important to you. That doesn't make it mandatory."

Their father's patience frayed. "Jordan, this is serious. Open the door."

"No."

"I'm your father."

"And this is my apartment. You're not invited."

Ethan stepped into view behind Jordan. "What do you want?"

His father's expression was controlled, dangerous calm. "I want you to come home. Both of you. We need to talk. As a family."

"We don't have anything to talk about."

"You signed MIT today. Against my advice, against your best interests. That has consequences."

"I know. You've made that clear."

"You don't know. Not yet. But you will. Come home. Hear me out."

"I'm not coming home. I don't live there anymore."

"You're seventeen. You live where I say you live."

"Actually, I live where Jordan lets me live. You cut me off financially, remember? Made me independent."

His father's jaw tightened. "The emancipation hearing is May 15th. Two weeks. You think you're going to win?"

"Dr. Martinez recommended it proceed."

"One evaluation. I have fourteen months of documentation. Every boundary you've crossed, every lie you've told, every time you've chosen Sophia over family. The court will see a teenager making terrible decisions, influenced by someone who doesn't have his best interests at heart."

"The court will see a young adult making autonomous choices about his future."

"We'll see. May 15th. Courthouse. 10 AM. Be ready."

His father turned to leave, then stopped. "One more thing. Come to the house tomorrow. Noon. There's something you need to see. Something about your case. About her."

"I'm not playing your games."

"It's not a game. It's evidence. Evidence the court will see if you don't see it first."

"What evidence?"

"Tomorrow. Noon. Come alone."

Then he was gone, footsteps receding down the hall.

Jordan closed the door, locked it. "That was ominous."

"He's bluffing."

"Maybe."

"What evidence could he possibly have?"

"I don't know. But he sounded confident."

Ethan pulled out his phone, started texting Sophia. Then stopped. What would he even say? "My dad has mysterious evidence about you?"

Jordan noticed. "You should tell her."

"Tell her what? That my dad is threatening something vague?"

"That something's coming. She should be prepared."

Ethan stared at his phone, cursor blinking in an empty message. Finally he typed: "My dad wants to meet tomorrow. Says he has evidence about the case. I don't know what it is."

Her response came quickly: "Evidence about what?"

"He said about you. About us. I don't know details."

"Should we be worried?"

"I don't know."

"Let me know what happens."

"I will."

But Ethan felt unease settling in his chest. His father didn't make empty threats. If he said there was evidence, there was evidence.

The question was: evidence of what?

---

May 2nd, 11:47 AM. Ethan stood outside his father's house—former home, now enemy territory—debating whether to go inside.

Jordan had offered to come, but Ethan refused. This was between him and his father.

He knocked. His father answered immediately, like he'd been waiting.

"Come in."

The house smelled the same, looked the same, felt completely foreign. Ethan followed his father to the office, the room where so many battles had been fought.

Two men were already there, the same professionals from Toronto. Lawyer and investigator, Ethan guessed.

"Sit," his father said.

Ethan sat. The three men remained standing, dominant position.

On the desk: folders, documents, photographs.

"You signed MIT yesterday," his father said. "Committed to a future based on a relationship I believe is unhealthy and manipulative."

"We've had this argument."

"We have. But you've never seen the full picture. The evidence I've been gathering since last March. Fourteen months of documentation."

He opened the first folder. Photographs spilled out.

Ethan recognized them immediately. Him and Sophia at the science fair. At hockey games. At coffee shops. At the park near school.

"You've been following us."

"I've been documenting concerning behavior."

More photos. Them studying together. Her at his games. Him at her tournaments. Every moment of their relationship, catalogued.

"This is stalking."

"This is parenting. Monitoring a minor child's relationships."

The investigator spoke for the first time. "We've been documenting since March of last year. Phone records, location data, social media, witness statements. Creating a complete picture of the relationship timeline."

"A relationship isn't a crime."

"No," his father said. "But there are concerning patterns."

He opened the second folder. Emails. Printed conversations between Ethan and Sophia about meeting after school, avoiding his father's restrictions, planning around supervision.

"Every time you lied about your location. Every time you met her against my instructions. Every time she facilitated contact that violated boundaries I'd set as your parent."

"Those boundaries were unreasonable."

"They were parental authority. She helped you violate them."

The third folder: text messages. Months of conversations between Ethan and Sophia, including messages about the emancipation, about fighting his father's control, about plans to attend MIT together.

"She encouraged emancipation," his father said. "Encouraged you to defy me, to fight for what she called 'freedom' but what I call manipulation."

"She encouraged me to think for myself."

"She encouraged a minor to rebel against his parent."

The fourth folder: school records. Ethan's attendance, showing days he'd missed, classes he'd skipped. Cross-referenced with location data showing him with Sophia during those times.

"Truancy," the lawyer said. "Facilitated by an adult who knew he should be in school."

"She's seventeen too. Same age as me."

"She turned eighteen in February," his father said. "She's been a legal adult for two and a half months. You're still a minor for three more months."

The words landed like a punch.

Ethan hadn't realized. Sophia's birthday had passed during the worst of the isolation, unnoticed in the chaos of provincial championships and emancipation filing.

She was eighteen. He was seventeen.

"So what?" Ethan said. "Two months difference doesn't change anything."

"It changes the legal framework," the lawyer said. "An adult in a relationship with a minor, encouraging that minor to defy parental authority, facilitating truancy, maintaining contact against parental instruction—that's legally significant."

"We didn't do anything wrong."

"You did many things wrong. The question is whether she broke the law."

The fifth folder. Legal documents. Statutes, case law, precedents.

The lawyer walked Ethan through them:

Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. When an adult encourages illegal behavior (like truancy) in a minor.

Interference with custody. When someone interferes with a parent's legal right to control their minor child's activities and relationships.

Criminal harassment under Canadian law. Maintaining unwanted contact with a family member of someone who's set boundaries.

"These are all potential charges," the lawyer said. "Based on the documented evidence."

Ethan's blood went cold. "You're going to press charges against Sophia."

"I'm going to protect my son," his father said. "From someone who's been manipulating him for fourteen months. Someone who encouraged rebellion, defiance, legal action against his family."

"She didn't manipulate me. She supported my choices."

"Choices that aligned with her goals. MIT together. Emancipation that would free you from my influence. Every decision pushing you toward her future, away from yours."

"MIT is my future. Engineering is my future."

"You wanted both until she came back. Then suddenly hockey was the enemy, I was the enemy, everything that wasn't her was the enemy."

"That's not true."

"The evidence says otherwise."

His father laid out the final folder. A legal document, formal and typed, signatures ready at the bottom.

"Criminal complaint," the lawyer explained. "Detailing the charges against Sophia Chen. Contributing to delinquency, interference with custody, harassment. Based on fourteen months of documented evidence."

Ethan read the complaint, words blurring together into nightmare reality.

"These will be filed with the prosecutor's office on May 14th," his father said. "The day before your emancipation hearing. The prosecutor will review and decide whether to press charges. Given the documentation, I'm confident they will."

"You can't do this."

"I can. And I will. Unless."

There it was. The trap.

"Unless what?"

"Unless Sophia ends all contact with you. Permanently. Documented in writing, legally binding. She stays in Winnipeg, you stay in Michigan. She goes to Toronto for university, you reconsider MIT. No contact, no relationship, no influence."

"I'm going to MIT. We signed yesterday."

"MIT accepts deferrals. Take a gap year, revisit the decision when you're eighteen and legally independent."

"I'm not doing that."

"Then she faces criminal charges. Contributing to delinquency is a misdemeanor, up to six months jail time. Interference with custody can be a felony, up to two years. Harassment is misdemeanor, fines and possible jail time. Even if she's not convicted, a criminal record follows you forever. She wants to be an engineer? Many employers won't hire someone with a criminal record, especially in fields requiring security clearances."

The words kept landing, each one worse than the last.

"This is insane."

"This is protective. I'm protecting you from someone who's been manipulating you for over a year."

"She hasn't manipulated me!"

"The court will decide that at the emancipation hearing. But the criminal charges are separate. Those go to the prosecutor. Based on this evidence, Sophia faces real legal jeopardy."

Ethan looked at the photographs, the emails, the texts. Fourteen months of their relationship, weaponized.

"You're saying drop MIT and her, or she goes to jail."

"I'm saying she ends contact, or she faces the legal consequences of her actions."

"Her actions were supporting me."

"Her actions were interfering with my parental authority over a minor child."

The investigator spoke again. "The deadline is May 15th, 9 AM. One hour before the emancipation hearing. If Sophia provides written statement ending all contact, permanently and irrevocably, the charges won't be filed. If she doesn't, the complaint goes to the prosecutor's office at 10 AM, during your hearing."

"So during the hearing, while I'm fighting for emancipation, she's being charged with crimes."

"Correct."

"And if I withdraw the emancipation petition?"

His father's expression didn't change. "The charges still proceed unless she ends contact. This isn't about the emancipation anymore. This is about protecting you from someone who's been a negative influence for fourteen months."

"This is about control."

"This is about consequences."

Ethan stood, legs unsteady. "I need to tell her."

"Yes," his father said. "You do. Tell her she has thirteen days. May 15th, 9 AM. Written statement ending all contact, or criminal charges. Her choice."

"This is blackmail."

"This is parenting."

"This is abuse."

"This is love. I'm trying to save you from making mistakes that will haunt you for the rest of your life."

Ethan looked at his father—the man who'd raised him, trained him, shaped his entire childhood—and saw a stranger. Someone so convinced of his righteousness that he'd destroy a teenage girl's future to maintain control.

"You're going to lose me," Ethan said quietly. "Whether emancipation happens or not, whether she ends contact or not, you're going to lose me. Because I'll never forgive this."

"You'll understand when you're older."

"I understand now. I understand you'd rather destroy us both than accept that I want something different than what you want for me."

His father didn't respond.

Ethan left the office, walked through the house that used to be home, stepped outside into cold spring air.

Thirteen days.

May 15th, 9 AM.

Sophia had to choose: end things permanently and let him face emancipation alone, or maintain contact and face criminal charges that could destroy her future.

Either way, his father won.

Either way, they lost.

Ethan pulled out his phone, hands shaking. This news was too big for text, too devastating for typing. He called Sophia.

She answered on the second ring, voice immediately concerned. He never called unless it was serious. "Hey, what happened?"

"We need to talk," he said. "In person. As soon as possible."

"Not on the phone. Can you meet me? The Forks. One hour."

"Ethan, you're scaring me."

"I know. I'm sorry. One hour. Please."

"I'll be there."

The call ended.

Ethan started walking, didn't call Jordan for a ride, needed the movement to process what he'd just heard.

Criminal charges. Jail time. Criminal record. MIT revoked. Engineering career destroyed.

All because she'd supported him. All because she'd believed in his right to choose his own future.

His father had found the ultimate weapon. Not money, not control, but law itself.

And there was no defense that didn't cost everything.

Sophia would face the impossible choice: sacrifice their relationship and her support for him, or sacrifice her entire future and risk prison.

And Ethan would have to watch, helpless, as his father destroyed the person who'd believed in him.

May 15th.

Thirteen days.

The countdown to losing everything had begun.
