# CHAPTER 1: THE EVALUATION

The waiting room was designed to be calming. Soft gray walls, abstract watercolor prints, a white noise machine humming somewhere behind the reception desk. Natural light filtered through gauzy curtains. Magazines fanned across the glass coffee table—Psychology Today, National Geographic, Time.

Ethan sat on the edge of a cream-colored armchair and felt like he was waiting for execution.

His phone buzzed. Jordan's text: "You got this. She's a professional. Dad can't buy her."

Ethan wanted to believe that. He'd researched Dr. Sarah Martinez online last week during his limited computer time. University of Michigan Med School. Twenty-three years in practice. Published articles on adolescent autonomy and family systems. Her reviews mentioned words like "fair," "insightful," "doesn't take sides."

But his father had chosen her. That had to mean something.

The door to the inner office opened. A woman in her mid-forties appeared, gray blazer over a simple blouse, dark hair pulled back in a professional bun. Her expression was neutral, practiced.

"Ethan?"

He stood, wiping his palms on his jeans. "Yes."

"I'm Dr. Martinez. Come on in."

Her office was similar to the waiting room—designed for comfort, achieving clinical calm. A desk with her laptop and notebook, two armchairs facing each other at an angle, a couch against one wall. More abstract art. A shelf of books with titles about family therapy, adolescent development, custody evaluation.

She gestured to one of the armchairs. "Have a seat wherever you're comfortable."

He chose the armchair, not the couch. The couch felt too vulnerable, like lying down for surgery.

Dr. Martinez sat across from him, notepad in her lap but pen not yet touching paper. "So, Ethan. Do you know why you're here?"

Straight to it, then. "My father ordered a psychiatric evaluation as part of blocking my emancipation petition."

"How do you feel about that?"

"I think he's hoping you'll say I'm being manipulated so the judge won't grant emancipation."

Her expression didn't change. "And are you being manipulated?"

"No."

"Tell me why you're seeking emancipation."

He'd practiced this answer with Michael Chen, with Jordan, with himself. Keep it factual. Don't sound angry or emotional. Adults respond to logic, not feeling.

"My father and I have fundamental disagreements about my future. He wants me to pursue professional hockey. I want to attend MIT and study engineering. He's using financial control and isolation to force his preferred path. Emancipation would allow me to make my own educational and life choices."

Dr. Martinez wrote something in her notepad. "How long have you wanted to study engineering?"

"Since I was nine or ten. I've always been interested in how things work. Physics, math, design."

"And hockey?"

"I started skating when I was four. My father was a professional player. It's been part of my life always."

"Do you enjoy it?"

The question caught him off guard. Nobody asked that. "Sometimes. I'm good at it. But it's not what I want to do with my life."

"What does your father say about MIT?"

"That I'm throwing away a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That I'm letting a girl manipulate me away from my potential. That I'll regret it when I'm older and my hockey window has closed."

Dr. Martinez looked up from her notes. "Tell me about the girl."

Here it was. The real reason for this evaluation.

"Her name is Sophia. We've known each other since we were kids. We reconnected last year when her family moved back to Winnipeg. She's smart, driven, talented. She's going to MIT too, but she made that decision independently. She got in on her own merit."

"Your father believes she's influencing your college choice."

"My father believes anyone who supports my goals instead of his is influencing me."

"That sounds like you're angry with him."

"I'm frustrated. There's a difference."

Dr. Martinez made another note. "Tell me about Sophia. How much time do you spend together?"

"We did. Before the restrictions."

"What restrictions?"

"After I filed for emancipation, my father implemented complete isolation. I can only call her once a week, supervised. I can't see her in person. He withdrew me from my prep school and hired tutors so I couldn't have contact with friends who might help us communicate."

"How does that make you feel?"

"Like I'm in prison."

"That's a strong word."

"It's an accurate word. I haven't left the house except for hockey practice in three weeks."

Dr. Martinez studied him for a moment. "Ethan, I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to be completely honest with me."

"Okay."

"Do you believe Sophia wants what's best for you, or what's best for herself?"

He met her eyes. "Both. The same way I want what's best for her and what's best for me. That's what caring about someone means."

"And if you had to choose between MIT and Sophia? If you could only have one?"

"That's not a fair question. I'm not choosing between them. I'm choosing my own future, which happens to include both academic goals and personal relationships. Those aren't mutually exclusive."

She wrote something that looked like three lines of text. "Your father believes you're making a mistake that will impact the rest of your life."

"My father believes any choice that isn't his choice is a mistake."

"Help me understand your relationship with your father."

Ethan leaned back in the chair, trying to organize thirteen years into coherent summary. "He loves hockey. It's his entire identity. He was drafted at eighteen, played professionally until an injury ended his career at thirty-one. He's spent my whole life training me to have the career he lost. Every decision has been about hockey: where we live, what school I attend, how I spend my time, who I spend it with. When I told him I wanted to study engineering, he said I could do that after hockey. When I said I wanted to go to MIT now, he said I was wasting my potential. When I said I was filing for emancipation, he said I was being manipulated. He can't accept that I might want something different than what he wants for me."

"That must be difficult."

"It's suffocating."

Dr. Martinez was quiet for a moment, pen still. "Ethan, I'm going to see you three times this week. Today, Wednesday, and Friday. After that, I'll compile my evaluation and submit it to the court. During these sessions, I'm not on your side or your father's side. I'm here to assess your decision-making capacity, your emotional state, and whether emancipation serves your best interests. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

"Good. Then let's start from the beginning. Tell me about meeting Sophia when you were nine."

---

The second session was Wednesday afternoon. Same waiting room, same calming aesthetics, same knot of tension in Ethan's chest.

This time, Dr. Martinez started with questions about his academic record. GPA, test scores, course selection, standardized testing. He recited the numbers: 4.0 unweighted, 1580 SAT, six AP courses so far.

"Impressive," she said, writing. "MIT is obviously a realistic goal academically. What do you want to study there?"

"Mechanical engineering, possibly with a focus on robotics or aerospace."

"Have you thought about career paths?"

"I've thought about a lot of paths. Research, design, maybe teaching eventually. The point is having options."

"And hockey doesn't provide options?"

"Hockey provides one option: play until you can't anymore, then figure out what to do with the rest of your life. I want to figure out my life now, while I have time to build it."

Dr. Martinez nodded, making notes. "Tell me about the science fair project I saw in your file. Something about prosthetics?"

He relaxed slightly, familiar territory. "Advanced prosthetic control systems using neural feedback. The idea is to create more intuitive interfaces between prosthetic limbs and users' nervous systems. Current systems rely on muscle contractions or manual controls, but with better sensors and processing, you could potentially restore near-natural movement."

"That sounds complex."

"It is. That's why it's interesting."

"Did Sophia help you with this project?"

Back to that. "We worked on different projects. She did something with materials science—aerodynamics in badminton. We brainstormed together sometimes, but the actual work was independent."

"Your father's lawyer provided emails between you and Sophia about the science fair. A lot of emails."

"We're friends. Friends communicate."

"The emails show a significant amount of emotional support."

"Is that a bad thing?"

"I'm not making judgments, Ethan. I'm trying to understand the nature of your relationship."

He chose his words carefully. "Sophia understands my goals because she has similar goals. We both want to attend top universities. We both care about academics and athletics. We both have parents who support us, though in very different ways. When my father was making things difficult, she listened. When I was stressed about applications, she helped. That's what friends do."

"Just friends?"

The question hung in the air. Ethan knew whatever he said here would end up in the report, would be analyzed for signs of "obsessive attachment" or "inappropriate influence."

"We care about each other," he said finally. "I don't know what label you want me to put on it. But whatever we are, it's mutual and it's healthy."

Dr. Martinez wrote something. "Your father believes the relationship is distracting you from opportunities."

"My father believes anything that isn't hockey is a distraction."

"Do you resent him?"

"I resent being controlled. I don't resent him wanting what's best for me. I just disagree about what 'best' means."

The session continued for another forty minutes. Questions about his daily routine, his relationship with Jordan, his plans for the future. Questions about whether he'd considered his father's perspective, whether he understood the financial implications of turning down NHL money, whether he'd thought about what happens if MIT doesn't work out.

"Yes," Ethan said to that last question. "I've thought about all of it. I'm not being impulsive. This isn't a rebellion. It's a choice."

"A choice to pursue education over professional sports."

"A choice to pursue my own path instead of someone else's."

Dr. Martinez closed her notepad. "Same time Friday. We'll talk more then."

---

Between Wednesday and Friday, Ethan existed in a strange limbo. His father was coldly polite, not mentioning the evaluation or the emancipation hearing. Jordan smuggled in messages from Sophia—brief texts through a Signal chat on Jordan's phone that Ethan could access when his brother was home.

Thursday morning: "hows it going with the doctor?"

Thursday evening: "okay i think. hard to tell. she doesn't give anything away"

Friday morning: "two weeks until nationals. first seed"

Friday afternoon: "youre going to destroy them"

The messages were lifelines. Proof that the world beyond his father's house still existed.

Friday's session started differently.

Dr. Martinez had papers spread across her desk when Ethan entered. "I want to go over something with you," she said, gesturing to the chair. "Your father provided me with documentation of your relationship with Sophia. Meeting dates, phone records, emails. There's a lot here."

Ethan's stomach tightened. "He's been tracking us."

"He's been documenting what he perceives as problematic behavior."

"We haven't done anything wrong."

"That's not what I'm investigating." She held up one paper. "Science fair night. February 15th. You were supposed to be home by ten. You arrived at midnight. Your father says you were with Sophia."

"We were celebrating. Both our projects won."

"Did you tell him where you were?"

"I texted that I'd be late."

"Two hours late?"

"I was seventeen. It was a special night. Nobody was hurt."

Dr. Martinez set down that paper, picked up another. "December 23rd. Your father found messages between you and Sophia planning to meet at a hockey rink. You told him you were doing extra practice."

"I did extra practice. She was there skating."

"So you lied about your plans."

"I omitted details he would have used to prevent me from going."

"That's called deception, Ethan."

He felt anger rising and pushed it down. "That's called survival. If I told him every time I wanted to spend time with someone he disapproves of, I'd never leave the house. Which, by the way, is exactly where I am now."

Dr. Martinez was quiet for a moment. "I understand you feel your father is controlling."

"He is controlling. That's not a feeling, it's a fact."

"Help me understand something. If emancipation is granted, what does your relationship with your father look like?"

The question caught him off guard. "I don't know."

"Do you want a relationship with him?"

"I want a relationship where he respects my choices."

"And if he can't do that?"

"Then I guess we don't have a relationship."

She wrote something that looked important. "That doesn't bother you?"

"Of course it bothers me. But staying under his control bothers me more."

The rest of the session covered logistics—his plans for housing if emancipated, financial aid options, support systems. By the end, Ethan felt wrung out, every answer scrutinized for hidden meanings.

"That's all for today," Dr. Martinez said finally. "I'll compile my report this weekend and submit it to the court Monday. Your hearing is scheduled for May 15th, correct?"

"Yes."

"Then you'll have my evaluation well before then."

"Can you tell me...?" He stopped, unsure how to ask.

"What I'm going to say?"

"If you think emancipation is justified."

Dr. Martinez closed her notebook. "I'm going to tell the court what I observe. That's all I can do."

---

Ethan didn't hear anything over the weekend. Monday morning, his father was silent at breakfast. Monday afternoon, nothing. By Monday evening, he was checking his phone every five minutes despite knowing the report would go to the lawyers first.

Tuesday morning, his father's lawyer called. Ethan wasn't supposed to hear the conversation, but he stood in the hallway outside his father's office, listening.

"I see." His father's voice, tight and controlled. "And her recommendation?"

Pause.

"That's... not what we discussed."

Longer pause.

"No. No, I understand. Yes. Thank you."

The phone call ended. Silence from the office.

Ethan knocked on the door frame. "Dad?"

"Come in."

His father sat behind his desk, Dr. Martinez's report in front of him. Multiple pages, stapled, official letterhead.

"Dr. Martinez completed her evaluation," his father said, voice carefully neutral.

"And?"

"She recommends the emancipation petition proceed. She finds you demonstrate 'exceptional maturity and clear autonomous decision-making.' She believes your relationship with Sophia is 'healthy and age-appropriate.' She sees no evidence of manipulation or undue influence."

The words should have felt like victory. Instead, Ethan saw his father's face and felt only dread.

"Dad—"

"She doesn't understand." His father stood, report still in his hand. "She spent three hours with you. I've spent seventeen years. She sees an articulate teenager who knows what he wants. I see my son throwing away everything we've built."

"I'm not throwing anything away. I'm choosing something different."

"You're choosing a girl and a pipe dream over guaranteed success."

"I'm choosing my own life."

His father set down the report with careful precision. "Dr. Martinez has done her evaluation. Now we deal with reality."

"What does that mean?"

"It means a psychiatric assessment can't change financial facts." His father opened a folder, pulled out papers. MIT letterhead. "MIT costs approximately $80,000 per year. For four years, that's $320,000. I've been saving for your education since you were born. That money was intended for your future."

Ethan's chest tightened. "Was?"

"I'm not paying for MIT."

The words hung in the air, sharp and final.

"You can't—"

"I can. And I will. You want to be an adult? Adults face financial realities. You want to make your own choices? Make them without my money."

"The NHL draft is in June. You're projected first round. Signing bonus alone could be $800,000, plus entry-level contract worth three million over three years. That money is yours. Guaranteed. Real."

He slid another paper across the desk. A commitment letter, NHL prospect registration.

"Sign this, and your college education is covered. Play for three years, then go to MIT if you still want to. You'll have money, experience, and options. Refuse to sign, and you're on your own financially. Your choice."

Ethan stared at the papers. MIT acceptance letter. NHL commitment letter. Two futures, mutually exclusive.

"I need time to think."

"You have until May 1st. College decision day. Sign this, or sign the MIT acceptance without my support. But understand: if you choose MIT now, you're choosing massive student debt, financial struggle, and uncertainty. Is she worth that?"

The question was designed to make this about Sophia. It wasn't.

"This isn't about her."

"Everything has been about her since she came back."

"This is about me having the right to choose my own future."

"Then choose. NHL money and security, or MIT debt and struggle. You want to be emancipated? Fine. Prove you can handle adult consequences."

His father picked up the report, the one that should have been a victory. "Dr. Martinez says you demonstrate clear autonomous decision-making. Let's see if she's right."

Ethan left the office with his head spinning. In the hallway, Jordan was waiting.

"I heard," his brother said quietly.

"He's going to cut me off completely."

"Unless you sign the NHL commitment."

"I can't sign that. That's giving him exactly what he wants."

"So what are you going to do?"

Ethan looked at his phone. Three weeks until May 1st. Three weeks to figure out how to pay for MIT without his father's money. Three weeks to decide if freedom was worth $320,000 of debt.

"I'm going to find another way."

Jordan's expression was skeptical. "How?"

"I don't know yet. But I'm not signing away my future because he's holding money over my head."

"Ethan—"

"There has to be another way."

Jordan's phone buzzed on the desk. He glanced at it, then passed it to Ethan. Sophia's message on Signal: "nationals april 25-27. toronto. qualified first seed"

Sophia. Three weeks until her national championships.

"He'll never let you go," Jordan said, reading over his shoulder.

"I know."

"If you defy him on this, he'll go nuclear. The MIT money will be gone for sure."

"I know that too."

"So?"

Ethan looked at the message. First seed. National championships. Everything she'd worked for.

"I'm going anyway."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure."

Jordan was quiet for a moment. Then: "I'll drive you."

"Jordan—"

"He can't control both of us. I'm in college, I have a car. He can threaten, but I have a scholarship. I'm not afraid of him anymore."

Ethan felt something shift. Not just him against his father. Him and Jordan. Together.

"April 26th," he said. "Toronto. We'll leave early."

"What about the NHL thing? The deadline?"

"I'll deal with that later. First, I'm going to watch her win a national championship."

"And Dad?"

Ethan looked back at his father's office, where the man was probably already planning his next move.

"Dad just played his financial card. He thinks money will control me the way hockey always did. He's about to learn he's wrong."

Jordan nodded slowly. "This is going to get worse before it gets better."

"I know."

"Emancipation hearing is May 15th."

"I know."

"What if you don't win?"

"Then I figure it out for a year and file again at eighteen."

"With no money, no support, and no guarantee MIT will still want you."

"Then I'll find another path. But I'm not giving up. Not now."

Jordan gripped his shoulder. "Okay. Toronto. April 26th. We'll leave at seven AM."

"Thank you."

"That's what brothers are for."

Ethan went back to his room, closed the door, and pulled up the financial aid information for MIT. There had to be a way. Scholarships, loans, work-study. Emancipated students qualified differently for aid, Michael Chen had mentioned. He started researching, clicking through pages, taking notes.

Somewhere in the numbers and application deadlines and eligibility requirements, there had to be an answer.

Because his father was right about one thing: adults face financial realities.

But adults also make their own choices.

And Ethan was choosing MIT, choosing his future, choosing freedom.

No matter what it cost.
