# CHAPTER 2: RECRUITMENT

The MIT financial aid website was designed for clarity, but at 1 AM, the numbers blurred together into one overwhelming truth: even with aid, the cost was staggering.

Ethan sat at his desk, laptop casting blue light across his face, working through the calculator. Expected Family Contribution: $65,000. Student Contribution: $8,000. MIT Grant: $7,000. Total remaining: $73,000 per year. Times four years: $292,000.

Even with the grant, he'd need loans for most of it. Federal loans maxed at $7,500 per year for undergrads. The rest would be private loans, at higher interest rates, requiring a co-signer he wouldn't have.

His savings account: $4,247. Summer job money from the past three years.

The math didn't work.

He opened another tab, searched "financial aid for emancipated students." The results were more promising. Without parental income counted, his Expected Family Contribution dropped to zero. MIT's need-blind admission meant they'd cover demonstrated need. With emancipation, his need would be total.

Full ride possible, Michael Chen had written.

Ethan clicked through to MIT's emancipated student guidelines. Documentation required: court order of emancipation, proof of self-support, verification of no parental financial assistance. Processing time: 4-6 weeks after emancipation granted.

May 15th hearing. June processing. June 30th first payment due.

It was tight, but possible.

If he won the hearing. If the paperwork processed in time. If MIT accepted the updated financial aid application.

A lot of ifs.

His phone buzzed. Jordan's message: "Still up?"

"Yeah."

"Dad's on the phone with someone. Sounds like NHL stuff."

Ethan closed the laptop. The financial aid research would be there tomorrow. Right now, he needed sleep before another day of walking on eggshells in his father's house.

But sleep didn't come easily. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the numbers. $292,000. Three hundred thousand dollars of debt versus three million dollars guaranteed.

His father's voice in his head: "Adults face financial realities."

Ethan turned over, pulled the blanket up, tried to quiet his mind.

Tomorrow. He'd figure it out tomorrow.

---

The next morning, Wednesday, Ethan was making breakfast when his father entered the kitchen already on the phone.

"Yes, he's here now. One moment." His father held out the phone. "Mike Hoffman from the Detroit Red Wings."

Ethan froze, spatula in hand.

"Take it," his father said.

Ethan set down the spatula, accepted the phone. "Hello?"

"Ethan Price?" A warm voice, friendly. "Mike Hoffman, player development for the Red Wings. How are you this morning?"

"I'm... good. Fine."

"Glad to hear it. Listen, I'll keep this brief. We've been watching you all season. Really impressive work. Your skating, your vision on the ice, your leadership. You're exactly the kind of player we build franchises around."

"Thank you."

"The draft is June 28th this year. We're picking twelfth. If you're still on the board, we're taking you. But we'd like to talk commitment before then. Get you signed to an entry-level contract, start planning your development path."

Ethan's father was watching him intently.

"I appreciate the interest," Ethan said carefully. "But I'm still considering my options."

"Of course, of course. But let me paint a picture for you. Entry-level contract, three years, $925,000 per year plus performance bonuses. Signing bonus, $850,000. That's guaranteed money, Ethan. Two point eight million over three years, minimum. And that's just the start. Players with your potential? Second contract could be eight, ten million per year."

The numbers were staggering. More money than most people saw in a lifetime.

"We'd want you to start in Grand Rapids, our AHL affiliate. One season developing, then you're ready for the NHL. By twenty, you could be playing on our first line. By twenty-two, you could be wearing a letter. This is the path to elite hockey, Ethan. The path your father took. The path you were born for."

"I need time to think about it."

"Sure, absolutely. But don't wait too long. Other teams are circling. We'd like to lock this down by May. Your dad has my number. Call anytime."

The call ended. Ethan handed back the phone.

"Detroit," his father said. "First round, guaranteed. That's the fourth call this week."

"You've been giving them my number?"

"I've been facilitating opportunities. That's what parents do."

"Parents who respect their kids ask first."

His father pocketed the phone. "Ethan, I want you to understand something. This isn't just about money. This is about legacy. Your grandfather played semi-pro. I played in the NHL. You have the talent to go further than both of us. That's rare. That's special."

"I don't want to play professional hockey."

"You're seventeen. You don't know what you want yet."

"I'm seventeen and I know exactly what I want. That's why we're having this fight."

His father sighed, the sound heavy with frustration. "MIT will still be there in three years."

"And what if I get injured? What if my first season I take a hit and my career ends before it starts? Then what? I've given up MIT, I've postponed my education, and I have nothing."

"That's why you sign the contract now. Even if you're injured, the money is guaranteed."

"I don't want the money. I want to study engineering."

"You can do both."

"No, I can't. NHL means full-time commitment. Training, games, travel. There's no time for MIT-level coursework."

"Then you take online classes. You do the engineering degree part-time."

"That's not the same thing."

His father's jaw tightened. "You're being stubborn."

"I'm being clear about my goals."

"Your goals are being influenced by someone who doesn't understand hockey."

"This has nothing to do with Sophia."

"Everything has to do with Sophia. Before she came back, you were fine with hockey. You played well, you focused, you understood your path. Then she shows up and suddenly you want MIT, you want emancipation, you want everything except what you've worked for your entire life."

"I've worked for this my entire life because you decided that's what I should work for. I never got a choice."

"You're getting one now. NHL or MIT. Money or debt. Success or struggle. Choose."

Ethan left the kitchen before he said something he'd regret.

In his room, he pulled up his email. Buried in the spam folder, flagged by his father's monitoring software, was a message from Michael Chen. Subject line: "Resources."

The email was brief: "Ethan, I did some research on financial aid for emancipated students. MIT has specific provisions. Emancipated students are considered independent for FAFSA purposes, which dramatically changes aid eligibility. With your academic profile and demonstrated need, full-ride scholarship is very realistic. I've attached some documentation. This stays between us. Good luck with everything. - Michael"

Three PDF attachments: MIT financial aid policy, emancipated student guidelines, FAFSA independent student information.

Ethan read through them carefully. Michael was right. If emancipation was granted, MIT would cover the full cost. Room, board, tuition, fees. Everything. The only requirement was proving he was financially independent from his parents.

Which meant his father's money wasn't just being withheld—it couldn't be accepted. Not if he wanted full aid.

The realization was both freeing and terrifying. He didn't need his father's support. But he also couldn't have it, even if his father changed his mind.

This was all or nothing.

His phone buzzed. Jordan: "Dad's setting up meetings with scouts. Next week. Tuesday and Thursday."

"I'm not meeting with them."

"He's scheduling them anyway."

"Then I won't show up."

"This is going to get ugly."

"It's already ugly."

"Fair point."

Ethan stared at his phone, then typed: "Can you get a message to Sophia?"

"Probably. What message?"

"Tell her I'm coming to nationals. April 26th. No matter what."

Pause. Then: "Confirmed. I'll tell her."

Ethan set down his phone and pulled up his research. Student loans, work-study, emancipated student aid. There was a path here. Narrow, uncertain, but real.

He just had to walk it without falling.

---

The next week was a careful dance of avoidance. His father scheduled meetings with NHL scouts. Ethan claimed illness, fatigue, prior commitments. The scouts called his phone directly. He let the calls go to voicemail.

His father's frustration built like pressure behind a dam.

Thursday evening, the dam broke.

"You missed the Chicago meeting."

"I had tutoring."

"Your tutor said you finished at three. The meeting was at five."

"I needed time to prepare for an exam."

"You're avoiding the scouts."

"I'm focusing on school."

"School is handled. You have a 4.0. You could stop going to classes and still graduate top of your class. The scouts are your future."

"They're your future, Dad. Not mine."

His father's control slipped, voice rising. "Do you understand what you're throwing away? Fourth-round picks make the money you're being offered. You're first round. Elite projection. Teams are fighting to talk to you, and you won't even take the meetings."

"Because I'm not signing with anyone."

"You don't have to sign. Just listen."

"Listening is the first step to pressure. I'm not interested."

"You're being childish."

"I'm being clear about my boundaries."

"Your boundaries are going to cost you millions of dollars."

"I'm okay with that."

His father stared at him, and Ethan saw something shift in his expression. Not anger now. Something colder.

"May 1st," his father said quietly. "College decision day. You have three weeks. NHL commitment or MIT commitment. You can't do both. Choose."

"I already have."

"Then you'd better be ready to live with the consequences."

---

Friday afternoon, Ethan's phone rang from an unknown number. He almost didn't answer, expecting another scout. But something made him pick up.

"Ethan Price?"

"Yes?"

"This is Bill Peters, Tampa Bay Lightning. Got a minute?"

Another scout. "I'm not really doing these calls right now."

"I understand you're considering college. That's smart. But hear me out."

Against his better judgment, Ethan listened.

"Tampa's picking eighth this year. You're on our board. We're prepared to offer you the following: three-year entry-level contract, $925,000 per year, $900,000 signing bonus. That's two point eight million guaranteed. Plus, we'll add an education package. We pay for college. Any school you want, any degree you want, after your hockey career. You want MIT? You play four, five years of hockey, bank eight to ten million, then go to MIT with no debt. Best of both worlds."

The offer was better than Detroit's. Smarter. Targeting exactly his objection.

"How long would I have to play?"

"That's up to you. Minimum three years for the entry contract. But most players your caliber, you're looking at ten to fifteen years in the league. But even if you only play three, that's three million in the bank. Then MIT, debt-free, with financial security."

It was logical. Tempting.

"I need time to think."

"Of course. But don't wait too long. Draft is June 28th. We'd like to have this settled by mid-May. After the draft, the numbers might change."

Mid-May. After the emancipation hearing.

"I'll keep that in mind."

"Your father's a legend, Ethan. We played against each other back in the day. He knows what this career means. Listen to him."

The call ended.

Ethan sat with his phone, staring at nothing.

Three million dollars. MIT paid for. No debt.

All he had to do was delay his education by three years. Play a sport he was good at but didn't love. Live the life his father had designed instead of the one he wanted.

And in three years, would MIT still feel possible? Or would he be twenty-one, established in hockey, the path to engineering feeling more and more distant?

His email pinged. Sophia's carefully routed message: "Two weeks until Toronto. Training hard. Can't wait to compete. Miss you."

Two weeks.

He typed back: "I'm coming. April 26th. Jordan's driving me. Dad doesn't know yet."

Her response came quickly: "Are you sure? He'll be furious."

"I'm sure. I want to watch you win."

"It might cost you the MIT money."

"It'll be worth it."

Pause. Then: "I can't wait to see you."

"Same. Two weeks."

Ethan closed the email and pulled up the calendar. April 26th, semifinals. April 27th, finals. National championships. Everything she'd trained for.

And he was going to be there, no matter what his father threatened.

---

The next week crawled by. More scout calls, more pressure, more careful avoidance. His father didn't mention the meetings anymore, but the tension in the house was thick enough to feel.

Jordan kept him updated on logistics. "I mapped the route. Six hours, straight shot to Toronto. We leave at 7 AM, we're there by 2 PM. Semifinals start at 3."

"He's going to lose his mind when he realizes we're gone."

"Probably. But I'll be with you. He can't physically stop us."

"He can cut off your funding."

Jordan shrugged. "I have a scholarship. He can cut off housing money, but I'll figure it out. This is important."

"Why are you risking this for me?"

"Because you're my brother. Because what he's doing is wrong. Because someone needs to stand with you."

Ethan felt emotion tighten his throat. "Thank you."

"That's what brothers are for."

Tuesday, April 23rd. Ethan's phone rang during dinner. His father glanced at the screen, then at him. "Detroit again."

"I'm not answering."

"They've called four times."

"Then they should take the hint."

His father set down his fork with careful precision. "You're making a mistake."

"I'm making a choice."

"You're throwing away three million dollars."

"I'm choosing a different path to success."

"There is no other path. Not for someone with your talent. You're built for hockey."

"I'm built for a lot of things. Hockey is just one of them."

His father's jaw worked. "The phone call this afternoon. The one you ignored. That was management. Not scouts. Front office. They wanted to make a final offer before moving on to other prospects."

"I don't want their offer."

"You don't even know what it was."

"It doesn't matter."

"Three point two million. Three-year entry-level contract, plus education package, plus signing bonus. That's the highest offer they can legally make. You just turned down generational wealth because you won't even listen."

Ethan met his father's eyes. "I heard you. I understand what I'm turning down. And I'm still choosing MIT."

"Because of her."

"Because of me."

The silence stretched, heavy and hostile.

Finally, his father spoke, voice quiet and cold. "I have a supervised call scheduled with Sophia tonight. Eight PM. You have fifteen minutes."

The call was later, Ethan at the kitchen table, his father at the counter pretending to read the paper but obviously listening.

Sophia's voice, when she answered: "Hey."

"Hey. How's training?"

"Good. Intense. Coach thinks I have a real shot at gold."

"You're going to win. I know it."

"I hope so. What about you? How are things there?"

Careful code. Things meant his father, the pressure, the escalating war.

"Complicated. But manageable. I'm still coming to Toronto."

"Are you sure that's smart?"

"Probably not. But I'm coming anyway."

He could hear her smile. "Semifinals are Saturday at 3. Finals Sunday at 2."

"I'll be there for both."

"Your dad—"

"Doesn't get to decide this. I'm watching you compete. End of story."

His father turned a page of the newspaper, the sound sharp in the quiet kitchen.

Sophia's voice softened. "I miss you."

"Miss you too. Two and a half weeks, then we figure everything out."

"May 1st. College decision day."

"I know what I'm choosing."

"Even without your dad's support?"

"Especially without his support. I'm not playing his game anymore."

"Ethan—"

"I'm sure. MIT, emancipation, freedom. That's the path."

"It's going to be expensive."

"I'll figure it out. Michael sent me information. If emancipation goes through, full ride is possible."

"Really?"

"Really. The numbers work. I just have to win the hearing."

"May 15th."

"May 15th."

His father cleared his throat. "Two more minutes."

Ethan checked the clock. Thirteen minutes down.

"I have to go soon," he told Sophia.

"I know. Good luck with everything. See you Saturday."

"See you Saturday. Go win a national championship."

"I'll do my best."

"Your best is going to be spectacular."

The call ended. Ethan set down the phone.

His father folded the newspaper. "Saturday. Toronto. That's when you're planning to defy me."

Not a question. A statement.

"I'm going to watch her compete."

"If you go to that tournament, the MIT money is gone. Not threatened. Gone. You understand that?"

"I understand."

"And you're going anyway."

"I'm going anyway."

His father studied him for a long moment. "You really think you can do this without my help. Pay for MIT, live independently, support yourself."

"I know I can."

"You're seventeen years old. You have no idea what financial independence means."

"Then I'll learn."

"You'll fail."

"Maybe. But it'll be my failure. Not yours."

His father's expression was unreadable. "You're so certain you're right."

"I'm certain I have the right to choose."

"Even if you choose wrong."

"Even then."

His father stood, picking up his newspaper. "Saturday. Toronto. Go if you want. But understand: when you walk out that door, you're walking away from more than MIT money. You're walking away from this family."

"Jordan's coming with me."

"Jordan is making his own mistakes."

"Or maybe we're both finally making our own choices."

His father left the kitchen without responding.

Ethan sat at the table, heart pounding, hands shaking slightly.

Three days until Toronto. Three days until he defied his father's ultimatum and drove six hours to watch Sophia compete for a national championship.

Three days until everything changed.

He pulled out his phone, sent a message through the carefully routed email: "Saturday. 7 AM. Jordan's driving. See you at 2."

Her response: "Can't wait."

Neither could he.

Because for the first time in his life, he was choosing what mattered to him over what mattered to his father.

And that felt like the first step toward freedom.

Even if it cost him everything.
