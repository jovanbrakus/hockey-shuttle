# CHAPTER 3: CHAMPIONSHIPS

Saturday morning, April 26th, 7:03 AM. Ethan slipped out of the house carrying a backpack with two days of clothes, phone charger, and MIT financial aid documents he'd printed for obsessive review.

Jordan's car idled at the end of the driveway, headlights cutting through the gray dawn.

Ethan climbed into the passenger seat. "He's still asleep."

"Good. Let's get gone before that changes."

Jordan pulled away from the house, accelerating toward the highway. The neighborhood slid past, quiet suburban streets giving way to arterial roads, then the entrance to I-94 East.

"Six hours," Jordan said. "We'll stop once for gas and food. Should be there by two."

Ethan pulled out his phone. No messages yet from his father, but that would change once he woke and realized both sons were gone.

"You ready for the fallout?" Jordan asked.

"No. But I'm going anyway."

"That's the spirit."

They drove in comfortable silence for a while, Michigan farmland rolling past under heavy clouds. Ethan watched the landscape change and thought about the last time he'd driven to see Sophia compete. February, provincials, the beginning of everything escalating. Now it was April, nationals, and the stakes had multiplied exponentially.

His phone buzzed. His father's name on the screen.

"That was fast," Jordan said.

Ethan answered. "I'm with Jordan. We're fine. I'll be back Sunday night."

"Where are you going."

Not a question. His father already knew.

"Toronto. Sophia's national championships."

"Turn around."

"No."

"Ethan, if you go to that tournament—"

"The MIT money is gone. You've said that. I understand. I'm going anyway."

"You're making a mistake."

"I'm watching someone I care about compete at the highest level. That's not a mistake."

His father's voice went cold. "You have two hours to come back. After that, there are consequences beyond money."

"I'm seventeen years old. I can travel with my adult brother. You can't stop me."

"I can make your life very difficult."

"You're already doing that."

The line went silent. Then: "Your emancipation hearing is May 15th. You better hope you win, because you're getting nothing from me after this."

"I know."

"Do you? Do you really understand what you're throwing away? Not just money. Your family. Your father. Everything."

"I understand I'm choosing my own path. If you can't accept that, that's your choice, not mine."

His father hung up.

Ethan lowered the phone, hands unsteady.

"That sounded fun," Jordan said.

"He's furious."

"He'll get over it. Or he won't. Either way, we're going to Toronto."

Ethan leaned back in the seat, watching Ohio countryside replace Michigan farmland. His phone buzzed repeatedly—texts from his father, increasingly angry, increasingly desperate. He put the phone on silent and tucked it in his backpack.

For the next six hours, he was free.

---

They hit Toronto at 1:47 PM, navigating downtown traffic to the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre in Scarborough. The facility was massive, modern glass and steel, tournament banners hanging outside the entrance.

Jordan found parking while Ethan checked his phone. Seventeen messages from his father, three from unknown numbers that were probably scouts or lawyers.

And one from Sophia: "Just finished warm-up. Semifinals at 3. Court 2. Can't believe you're really here."

"We're parking now. See you soon."

Inside, the sports centre hummed with energy. Multiple courts, matches in progress, athletes warming up, parents and coaches clustered in viewing areas. Somewhere overhead, an announcer called a match score.

Ethan found the tournament bracket posted near registration. Women's Singles, Elite Division. Semifinals: Court 1, 3 PM, Amy Chen vs. Jessica Tran. Court 2, 3 PM, Sophia Chen vs. Rachel Kim.

Rachel Kim. Ethan recognized the name. Current national champion, defending her title. Sophia's toughest possible matchup.

"Court 2," Jordan said, checking his phone. "This way."

They made their way through the facility, following signs and crowds. Court 2 was surrounded by bleachers already half-full with spectators. On the court, athletes were finishing a men's doubles match.

Ethan scanned the warm-up area and found her.

Sophia stretched near the court entrance, wearing Team Manitoba blue and white, hair pulled back, face focused. Her coach stood nearby, talking through strategy. She nodded, listening, but her eyes swept the crowd.

Looking for him.

Ethan moved closer to the court barrier. When her gaze passed his direction, he raised a hand.

She saw him. The focus broke into a smile, just for a second, before she controlled it back to competition mode. But he saw the relief, the joy, the you're really here in her expression.

Her coach noticed the distraction, looked over, saw Ethan. Michael Chen's face was complex—concerned, resigned, maybe a little relieved too.

Sophia said something to her coach, then jogged over to the barrier.

"You came."

"I said I would."

"I know, but after everything—" She stopped herself, glancing at Jordan. "Hi, Jordan."

"Hey, Sophia. Go win this thing."

"I'll try."

The previous match ended, players shaking hands, exiting the court. An official called for semifinals players to take positions.

"That's me," Sophia said. "I have to—"

"Go," Ethan said. "We'll be up there." He pointed to the bleachers.

She nodded, started to turn, then stopped. "I'm really glad you're here."

"I wouldn't miss this."

She ran back to her coach, grabbed her racket, stepped onto the court.

Ethan and Jordan climbed into the bleachers, finding seats with clear view of the court. Around them, other spectators settled in, cameras ready, coaching notes open.

The announcement came over the speakers: "Women's Singles Semifinals, Court 2. Sophia Chen, Manitoba, first seed, versus Rachel Kim, British Columbia, defending national champion. Best of three games. First serve to Rachel Kim."

Rachel was taller than Sophia, athletic and powerful, confidence radiating from her stance. She'd won this tournament last year. She expected to win it again.

Sophia took her position, racket ready, expression calm.

The serve came hard and deep. Sophia returned it down the line, testing Rachel's backhand. The rally developed, both players probing for weakness.

Fifteen shots in, Rachel smashed. Sophia dove, got her racket on it, popped it high. Rachel smashed again, unreturnable.

1-0, Rachel.

"She's strong," Jordan murmured.

"Sophia's faster," Ethan said.

The match progressed, tight and competitive. Rachel's power against Sophia's speed and strategy. Every point felt earned, neither player giving anything easy.

At 8-7 Rachel, Sophia adjusted tactics. Instead of trying to match power, she started using angles, drop shots, deceptive clears. Making Rachel move, forcing errors, controlling tempo.

11-8, Sophia.

"There we go," Jordan said.

Rachel called timeout, conferred with her coach. When play resumed, she'd adjusted too, mixing up her shots, varying pace.

The first game stayed tight. 18-17 Sophia. 19-19. 20-19 Rachel. Game point.

Rachel's serve, hard and low. Sophia returned it, Rachel smashed, Sophia defended, Rachel smashed again. The shuttle seemed impossible to reach, but Sophia extended, barely got her racket on it, sent it looping back over the net.

Rachel moved forward for the kill shot, but the shuttle dropped short. She lunged, hit the net.

20-20.

Sophia's serve now. She kept it simple, deep and high. Rachel returned with a clear, Sophia dropped it short, Rachel ran forward, returned cross-court, Sophia was waiting, smashed down the line.

21-20, Sophia.

Game point again. Rachel's face showed frustration now, control slipping.

Long rally, back and forth, both players breathing hard. Then Sophia saw the opening, drop shot perfectly placed, Rachel ran but couldn't reach it.

21-19. Sophia took the first game.

In the bleachers, Ethan released breath he didn't know he'd been holding. Beside him, Jordan was grinning.

"One more game like that," Jordan said.

But the second game was different. Rachel came out aggressive, angry, determined. She'd lost the first game. She wasn't losing the match.

Her smashes found corners. Her serves caught Sophia off-guard. The power game that Sophia had neutralized in game one worked in game two.

10-5, Rachel.

15-9.

Sophia called timeout. Michael Chen met her at the side, water bottle and quiet words. Ethan couldn't hear what was said, but he saw Sophia nod, shake out her arms, refocus.

When play resumed, she was different. More patient. Defending everything, making Rachel work for every point. The power shots kept coming, but Sophia wasn't trying to match them anymore. She was surviving them, waiting for Rachel to make mistakes.

17-14, Rachel.

19-16.

20-17. Game point for Rachel.

But Sophia defended the kill shot, defended the next smash, defended until Rachel went for too much angle and hit it out.

20-18.

Sophia's serve. Rachel attacked it, Sophia defended, Rachel smashed, Sophia lobbed it high, Rachel smashed again, Sophia got under it, returned it, Rachel hit the net.

20-19.

The crowd was loud now, invested in the comeback.

But Rachel closed it out on the next point, smash that Sophia couldn't reach.

21-19. Rachel won the second game.

1-1. Third game to decide who went to finals.

Ethan's heart pounded. Jordan was leaning forward, elbows on knees, watching intently.

On the court, both players looked tired. This was the moment of truth. Whoever had more left, whoever wanted it more, whoever could push through fatigue and pressure.

The third game started cautiously, both players testing. 3-2 Sophia. 5-4 Rachel. 7-7.

Neither could establish dominance. Every point was a battle.

At 10-10, something shifted. Sophia found another gear. Maybe the crowd energy, maybe something internal, but she started moving faster, hitting harder, playing with certainty.

13-10 Sophia.

16-12.

18-14.

Rachel tried to rally, got two points back. 18-16. But Sophia closed the door. Three straight points, perfect execution, no mistakes.

21-16. Sophia won the semifinals.

The crowd erupted. Sophia bent over, hands on knees, breathing hard. Then she straightened, shook Rachel's hand at the net, thanked the officials.

As she left the court, her eyes found Ethan in the bleachers.

He was clapping, standing, overwhelmed with pride.

She'd done it. Beaten the defending champion. She was going to finals.

---

After the match, Ethan waited near the warm-up area. Officials and coaches moved around, preparing for the next matches. Sophia emerged from the athlete area, changed into warm-up clothes, hair damp from a quick shower.

She saw him and smiled, the exhausted but happy smile of someone who'd just won something important.

"That was incredible," Ethan said.

"Thanks. I can't believe you saw it."

"I wouldn't have missed it."

They stood there, aware of people watching, coaches and officials and other athletes. Not the place for the reunion they wanted.

Michael Chen approached, carrying Sophia's equipment bag. He looked at Ethan, expression complicated.

"That was a hell of a drive," he said.

"Six hours. Worth it."

"Your father's going to be furious."

"He already is."

Michael sighed. "You two need to be careful. Finals are tomorrow at 2 PM. Sophia needs to rest, recover, prepare. No distractions."

"I'm not a distraction," Ethan said.

"That's not what I meant." Michael's voice softened. "I'm glad you're here. I'm glad she has support. But tomorrow is the most important match of her life so far. Let her focus."

"I will."

"We're staying at a hotel near the venue. Team accommodations. Sophia needs to stay with the team tonight."

Sophia started to protest, but Michael raised a hand. "Non-negotiable. You have curfew, nutrition plan, strategy session. This is nationals, not a social visit."

"Dad—"

"Tomorrow after the match, you'll have time. Tonight, you're an athlete. Understood?"

She nodded reluctantly.

Jordan appeared with hotel information on his phone. "Ethan and I got a room a few blocks away. We'll be here tomorrow at 1 PM for warm-up."

"Good," Michael said. He looked at both of them. "I hope you know what you're risking. Both of you."

"We know," Ethan said.

Michael nodded, then guided Sophia back toward the team area. She looked back once, small wave, then disappeared into the building.

"Her dad's protective," Jordan observed.

"He's a lawyer. He understands what my father can do legally."

"Can he help?"

"I think he wants to. But it's complicated."

They left the sports centre, found their hotel, checked in. The room was basic but clean, two beds, view of Toronto traffic. Ethan showered, changed, tried to eat dinner, but his mind was elsewhere.

Tomorrow. Finals. National championship.

And somewhere in Michigan, his father was planning his next move.

Ethan's phone had been silent since they'd arrived in Toronto, which meant his father had moved past angry texts to strategic thinking. That was more dangerous.

But tomorrow, none of that mattered.

Tomorrow, Sophia was competing for gold.

And Ethan was going to watch her win.

---

Sunday, April 27th, 1:00 PM. The sports centre was more crowded than yesterday, finals drawing bigger audiences. Ethan and Jordan arrived early, found seats close to the court.

The bracket update showed Sophia's opponent: Amy Chen from Vancouver, no relation, who'd won the other semifinal yesterday in straight games.

At 1:30, athletes began warming up. Sophia appeared in competition gear, Team Manitoba uniform, hair braided back. She looked focused, in the zone, but when she spotted Ethan in the stands, she allowed herself a small smile.

He smiled back.

You've got this.

At 1:50, officials called finalists to the court. The announcement echoed through the facility: "Women's Singles National Championship Final. Sophia Chen, Manitoba, versus Amy Chen, Vancouver. Best of three games."

The stands were packed now, hundreds of spectators, cameras, live streaming setup. This was the highest level of badminton competition in Canada. The winner would be national champion, get funding, international competition opportunities, national team consideration.

Everything Sophia had trained for.

The match began.

Amy came out aggressive, powerful smashes, deep clears, testing Sophia immediately. First game started fast.

3-1 Amy.

5-2.

Sophia adjusted, started playing her game. Speed, angles, strategy. By 8-7, she'd taken the lead.

The first game was tight, both players elite level, neither giving ground easily. 18-17 Amy. 19-19. 20-19 Sophia.

Game point.

Sophia served, Amy returned hard, rally developed. Twelve shots, both players sprinting, diving, fighting. Then Sophia saw her moment, cross-court drop shot, perfectly weighted.

Amy lunged, couldn't reach it.

21-19. Sophia took the first game.

In the stands, Ethan breathed. One game up. One game away from gold.

But Amy wasn't done. The second game, she came out determined. Her smashes found corners, her defense was impenetrable.

8-4 Amy.

12-7.

Sophia called timeout, conferred with her coach. When she returned to the court, she looked calmer, more patient.

But Amy had momentum. She closed out the second game efficiently, clinical.

21-17 Amy.

1-1. Everything would be decided in the third game.

Ethan's heart hammered. Jordan was gripping the seat in front of him. Around them, the crowd was electric.

Third game. National championship on the line.

Both players looked tired, matches over two days taking their toll. But neither showed any sign of quitting.

The game started cautiously. 3-3. 6-5 Sophia. 8-7 Amy.

Neither could break away. Every point was earned, every rally exhausting.

At 11-10 Amy, they switched sides. Brief break, towels, water, both players breathing hard.

Play resumed.

Sophia started finding her rhythm. Her drop shots were landing perfectly, her defense reading Amy's smashes. She started pulling away.

14-11 Sophia.

16-12.

18-14.

Amy tried to rally, got one point back. 18-15. But Sophia was in control now, playing with confidence and precision.

19-15.

20-16.

Championship point.

Sophia served. Amy returned aggressively, trying to prevent the winning shot. Rally developed, long and brutal. Both players sprinting, both exhausted, both refusing to lose.

Twenty shots. Thirty. Sophia defending, defending, waiting for the opening.

Then she saw it. Amy slightly off-balance, recovering from a lunge.

Sophia's drop shot, perfectly placed, cross-court, untouchable.

Amy dove, fully extended, but couldn't reach it.

21-16.

Sophia won.

National Champion.

The crowd exploded. Sophia dropped her racket, bent over, hands on knees, breathing hard, disbelief and joy on her face.

Her coach ran onto the court, embracing her. Her teammates followed. Officials were clapping, Amy was shaking her hand, congratulating her.

And in the stands, Ethan was standing, clapping, overwhelmed with pride and joy.

She'd done it.

National Champion.

All hers, earned through her own talent and work and determination.

The victory ceremony was ten minutes later. Three podiums set up on the court, bronze and silver finalists already in position.

When they called Sophia's name for gold, she stepped onto the top podium. The official placed the gold medal around her neck, the national anthem played, and she stood there at the highest level of her sport.

Her eyes swept the crowd, found Ethan.

Their eye contact held across the distance.

This moment was hers. This achievement was hers. The medal was hers.

But having him there to witness it made it complete.

The ceremony ended. Photographs, interviews, official business. Ethan waited in the lobby area, letting her have her moment with coaches and teammates and family.

Finally, she emerged from the athlete area, gold medal still around her neck, smile radiant.

Ethan met her halfway, and they hugged, fierce and relieved and celebrating.

"You did it," he said.

"I did it."

"National Champion."

"National Champion."

Jordan appeared with congratulations, then Michael and Helen Chen, both beaming with pride. For a few minutes, it was celebration, happiness, victory untainted by outside pressures.

Then Ethan's phone buzzed. Unknown number, Michigan area code.

He ignored it.

The phone buzzed again. Same number.

"You should answer that," Michael said quietly.

Ethan stepped away, answered. "Hello?"

"Ethan Price?" Professional voice, official.

"Yes?"

"This is David Morrison, representing Robert Price in the emancipation proceeding. Is your father with you?"

"No."

"I see. Are you currently in Toronto?"

Ethan's stomach tightened. "Why?"

"Your father is here. At the sports centre. He'd like to speak with you. Outside the main entrance."

The celebration froze.

"He's here?"

"Yes. He arrived an hour ago. If you could join him outside, that would be appreciated."

The call ended.

Ethan lowered the phone. Sophia was watching him, joy draining from her expression.

"What's wrong?"

"My father's here."

The words fell like stones.

"Here? In Toronto?"

"Outside. He wants to talk."

Michael's face went professional, lawyer mode. "Don't go alone."

"I'm not afraid of him."

"It's not about fear. It's about witnesses. I'll come with you."

Jordan nodded. "Me too."

They moved toward the entrance, celebration evaporating into dread. The lobby was still crowded with post-tournament athletes and families, but they cut through to the main doors.

Outside, under gray April sky, Robert Price waited.

He wasn't alone. Two men in business attire stood with him, briefcases, professional demeanor. Lawyers or investigators, Ethan guessed.

His father's expression was controlled, cold, dangerous.

"Ethan."

"Dad."

"You defied me."

"I came to watch Sophia compete."

"You chose her over your family."

"I chose to support someone I care about. That's not mutually exclusive with family."

His father's jaw tightened. "You left Michigan against my direct order. You ignored my calls. You prioritized a relationship over your future."

"I prioritized being a decent human being over your control."

One of the men with his father stepped forward, handed Ethan a document. "This is notification of change to your financial support status. Effective immediately, college funding is terminated. Your access to family accounts is revoked. You're financially independent as of today."

Ethan took the document, scanned it. Legal letterhead, official language, his father's signature.

"You're disowning me."

"I'm giving you what you wanted," his father said. "Independence. Adult responsibility. You think you can manage without my support? Prove it."

Michael stepped forward. "Robert, this is extreme."

"Stay out of this, Michael. This is between me and my son."

"This is between you and your need for control," Michael said. "You're punishing him for having autonomy."

"I'm teaching him consequences."

"You're destroying your relationship with him."

His father's expression didn't change. "If he wants a relationship, he knows what to do. Sign the NHL commitment. Respect the path I've laid for him. Otherwise, he's on his own."

Ethan found his voice. "The emancipation hearing is May 15th."

"I know."

"I'm still filing."

"I know that too." His father's smile was cold. "You better hope you win. Because you're getting nothing from me after this. Not college, not housing, not support of any kind."

He turned to leave, the two professionals following.

"Enjoy the championship," he called back. "It's the last happy moment you'll have."

Then he was gone, disappearing into Toronto traffic.

Ethan stood there, document in hand, world tilting.

Sophia appeared beside him, gold medal still around her neck, victory already feeling distant.

"What did he do?"

"Cut me off financially. Completely."

"Can he do that?"

"He just did."

Michael took the document, read it quickly. "This is legally binding. He's terminated all financial support effective immediately."

"So I'm independent now."

"Involuntarily, yes."

"Does that help with emancipation?"

"It complicates it. You're already unsupported, which removes one of the main reasons for emancipation. But it also proves his control tactics."

Ethan's mind raced. "If I'm financially independent already, do I still qualify for the MIT aid package?"

"You'd need the court to officially recognize your independence. That's the emancipation hearing."

"Which is May 15th."

"Right."

"And MIT's first payment is due June 30th."

"You're cutting it very close."

Jordan put a hand on Ethan's shoulder. "We'll figure it out."

But Ethan saw his father's strategy now. Cut him off, force financial desperation, make emancipation both necessary and difficult to prove. Make him dependent on Sophia's family, which would feed the "manipulation" narrative.

Every move calculated.

Every escape route narrowed.

Sophia took his hand. "We'll figure it out," she echoed Jordan's words.

Ethan looked at her—gold medal, victory, national champion—and felt the weight of what his father had just done.

Last happy moment.

The words echoed.

"Let's get out of here," he said.

They left the sports centre, Toronto afternoon gray and cold despite spring. The championship was won, the celebration destroyed, and Ethan's phone was already filling with automated texts about closed bank accounts and canceled credit cards.

Financial independence, forced at seventeen.

This was what freedom cost.

And the bill was just beginning.
