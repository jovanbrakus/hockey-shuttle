# CHAPTER 3: CHAMPIONSHIPS

Saturday morning, April 26th, 7:03 AM. Ethan slipped out of Jordan's apartment building carrying a backpack with two days of clothes, phone charger, and MIT financial aid documents he'd printed for obsessive review during sleepless hours.

Jordan's car—a ten-year-old Honda Civic with a dent in the passenger door and a "Michigan Engineering" sticker fading on the back window—idled at the curb, exhaust visible in the cool morning air.

Ethan climbed into the passenger seat. The car smelled like old coffee and the pine air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror. "Ready?"

"Let's go before I change my mind," Jordan said, but he was smiling.

They pulled away from the apartment complex, navigating empty morning streets toward the highway. The sunrise was just beginning, painting the eastern sky in shades of rose and gold. Spring in Michigan meant unpredictable weather—yesterday had been warm, today promised rain—but right now, everything felt possible.

"Six hours," Jordan said, merging onto I-94 East. "We'll stop once for gas and food in Michigan. Should be there by two."

Ethan pulled out his phone. No messages yet from his father, but that would change once Robert woke and realized both sons had left. He checked Signal—Sophia had sent a message at 6:30 AM: "team breakfast. so nervous i cant eat. cant believe today is happening"

He typed back: "on the road. youre going to be amazing"

"Six hours is so long"

"itll go fast"

"what if i lose"

"you wont. but even if you do, youre a national semifinalist. thats incredible"

"i want gold though"

"i know. youre going to get it"

Pause. Then: "thank you for coming. means everything"

"wouldnt miss it"

Ethan put his phone in the cup holder and watched Michigan slide past. Farmland, small towns, billboards advertising truck stops and Jesus. The highway was quiet this early on a Saturday, mostly long-haul truckers and a few other travelers with places to be.

"You ready for the fallout?" Jordan asked after they'd been driving for twenty minutes.

"No. But I'm going anyway."

"That's the spirit." Jordan adjusted his grip on the steering wheel. "For the record, this is either the most romantic or the most stupid thing I've ever done."

"Can't it be both?"

"Probably is." Jordan turned up the radio—some indie rock station from Detroit—then turned it down again. "You know Dad's going to cut off my housing money after this."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I'm making this choice. He doesn't get to control both of us forever."

Ethan looked at his brother. "What are you going to do? About the apartment?"

"I've been thinking about it. My scholarship covers tuition. I can pick up more hours at work, maybe find a roommate to split costs. It'll be tight, but doable." Jordan glanced over. "We'll figure it out. That's what we do."

Forty minutes into the drive, Ethan's phone buzzed. His father's name on the screen.

"That was fast," Jordan said.

Ethan answered, putting it on speaker. "I'm with Jordan. We're fine. I'll be back Sunday night."

"Where are you going." Not a question. His father already knew.

"Toronto. Sophia's national championships."

"Turn around." The voice was cold, controlled, dangerous.

"No."

"Ethan, if you go to that tournament—"

"The MIT money is gone. You've said that. I understand. I'm going anyway."

"You're making a mistake that will follow you for the rest of your life."

"I'm watching someone I care about compete at the highest level. That's not a mistake. That's what decent people do."

His father's voice dropped lower, more menacing. "You have two hours to come back. After that, there are consequences beyond money."

"I'm seventeen years old traveling with my twenty-one-year-old brother. That's legal. You can't stop me."

"I can make your life very difficult."

"You're already doing that. How much worse can it get?"

The silence on the other end felt heavy, pregnant with threat. Then: "Your emancipation hearing is May 15th. You better hope you win, because you're getting nothing from me after this. Nothing."

"I know."

"Do you? Do you really understand what you're throwing away? Not just money. Your family. Your father. Your future. Everything."

"I understand I'm choosing my own path. If you can't accept that, if you'd rather destroy me than let me make my own choices, that's your decision. Not mine."

His father hung up.

Ethan lowered the phone, hands shaking. He pressed them flat against his thighs, tried to steady his breathing.

"Well," Jordan said after a moment. "That was about as bad as expected."

"He sounded... cold. Like he's already decided something."

"Probably has. But we're already an hour out. We're not turning back now."

Ethan leaned back in the seat, watching Michigan landscape roll past. His phone buzzed repeatedly over the next hour—texts from his father, increasingly hostile, each one a variation on the same theme: come back, you're making a mistake, there will be consequences.

He turned off his phone completely and tucked it in his backpack.

For the next five hours, he was free.

They crossed into Canada at the Windsor-Detroit border just after 10 AM. The customs agent looked at their IDs, asked about the purpose of their visit.

"Badminton tournament," Jordan said. "Watching a friend compete."

"How long will you be in Canada?"

"One night. Leaving tomorrow evening."

The agent waved them through.

Ontario looked remarkably like Michigan—flat farmland, similar weather, same highway monotony. But as they drove east on Highway 401, Ethan felt something shift. Distance from his father. Distance from the house that had felt like a prison. Every kilometer put more space between him and the life Robert had tried to force him into.

"Feel better?" Jordan asked.

"Yeah. Actually, yeah."

They stopped for lunch at a Tim Hortons somewhere between London and Milton. The place was packed with families, highway travelers, teenagers on road trips. Ethan ordered a sandwich and coffee, sat in a booth by the window watching traffic stream past.

"Five more hours and we'll be there," Jordan said, checking his phone. "Tournament starts at 3 PM. We'll have time."

Ethan pulled out his own phone, powered it back on. Seventeen messages from his father. He deleted them all unread. One Signal message from Sophia: "warmup in 30 min. getting real now"

"youre going to kill it"

"scared"

"you got this. ill be there cheering"

"cant wait to see you"

"same. two more hours"

He put his phone away and finished his sandwich. The coffee was terrible but necessary. He hadn't slept well, anxiety about the drive and the competition and whatever his father was planning keeping him awake until past 2 AM.

Back on the highway, the landscape started to change. More traffic, more urban sprawl. They were entering the Greater Toronto Area, one of the largest metro regions in North America. Office parks, strip malls, residential developments stretched for miles.

"Toronto's huge," Ethan said.

"Fourth largest city in North America," Jordan replied. "Nearly three million people in the city proper, six million in the metro. Makes Detroit look small."

They hit Toronto proper at 1:47 PM, navigating increasingly dense traffic toward Scarborough. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre was on the eastern edge of the city, a massive modern facility built for the 2015 Pan American Games.

Jordan found parking while Ethan checked his phone. Twenty-one messages from his father now, three from unknown numbers that were probably scouts or lawyers.

And one from Sophia: "just finished warmup. semifinals at 3, court 2. cant believe youre actually here"

He typed back: "parking now. see you in 5 min"

They walked toward the entrance, backpacks slung over shoulders. The facility was enormous—glass and steel and concrete, clean lines and modern architecture. Tournament banners hung outside: "Badminton Canada National Championships 2025."

Inside was controlled chaos.

The sports centre hummed with energy that hit Ethan like a physical force. The smell struck him first—a mixture of sweat, sports tape, the rubber of court shoes against polished floors, and something else he couldn't quite identify. Determination, maybe. Competition.

Multiple badminton courts filled the massive space, matches already in progress on several. The distinctive *thwack* of shuttles being hit echoed through the facility, mixed with referee calls, coach instructions, and crowd reactions. Athletes warmed up in designated areas, their movements sharp and focused. Parents and coaches clustered in viewing sections, phones out, recording every moment.

Overhead, the PA system called match updates: "Court 3, women's doubles quarterfinals now beginning. Court 5, men's singles semifinals in ten minutes."

Ethan scanned the space, trying to orient himself. The facility was enormous—he counted at least twelve courts, all with matches or warmups happening simultaneously. Tournament brackets were posted near registration, showing the day's schedule.

"There," Jordan pointed to a digital display showing court assignments. "Court 2. Women's Singles Semifinals at 3 PM."

They navigated through the crowd toward Court 2. The bleachers were already half-full, parents and fans claiming good viewing spots. A livestream camera was being set up courtside—Badminton Canada would be streaming the semifinals and finals on YouTube, archived for coaches and scouts to review later.

Ethan scanned the warm-up area. Athletes in team uniforms stretched, practiced footwork, shadow-swung their rackets. Team Manitoba wore blue and white. British Columbia was red. Ontario gold. Quebec black and white. Every province represented, every athlete at this level representing years of training and sacrifice.

And then he saw her.

Ethan scanned the warm-up area and found her.

Sophia stretched near the court entrance, wearing Team Manitoba blue and white, hair pulled back in a competition braid, face focused. She was checking her phone, probably looking for his text, and hadn't seen him yet.

For a second, Ethan just watched her. Two weeks since he'd seen her in person. Two weeks of isolation had been photographs and monitored phone calls and messages smuggled through Jordan. Now she was right there, twenty feet away, real and solid and—

She looked up. Saw him.

The smile that broke across her face made the six-hour drive, the furious voicemails, all of it worth it.

She crossed the distance between them quickly, and suddenly they were hugging, fierce and relieved, her racket bag hitting his shoulder, her hair smelling like tournament venue and hotel shampoo and something that was just her.

"You came," she said into his shoulder.

"Always." His arms tightened around her. Two weeks of isolation breaking in one hug. He'd forgotten what this felt like—being close to her, being allowed to just be close without supervision or countdown timers or his father listening from another room.

She pulled back just enough to look at him, still in his arms. Her eyes were bright, maybe tears held back, maybe just overwhelming relief. "I can't believe you're actually here."

"I can't believe it either." His heart was still racing. "I know, but after everything—"

She stopped herself, glancing past him. "Hi, Jordan."

"Hey, Sophia. Go win this thing."

"I'll try."

Her hand was still on his arm. She noticed, started to pull away, but he covered her hand with his own, holding it there for a second longer.

"How do you feel? Ready?"

"Terrified. But less terrified now."

The previous match ended, players shaking hands, exiting the court. An official called for semifinals players to take positions.

"That's me," Sophia said. "I have to—"

"Go." He made himself let go, even though every instinct said to hold on. "We'll be up there." He pointed to the bleachers. "Go win."

She grabbed her bag, squeezed his hand once more, then jogged toward the court entrance. Ten feet away, she looked back, grinning.

Then Michael Chen emerged from the team area, and his expression when he saw Ethan was complicated—concern, resignation, maybe a little relief too. He nodded at Ethan, a small gesture that said I'm glad you're here even if this makes everything more complicated.

Sophia ran back to her coach, grabbed her racket, stepped onto the court, but Ethan could still feel the warmth of her hand in his.

Ethan and Jordan climbed into the bleachers, finding seats with clear view of the court. Around them, other spectators settled in, cameras ready, coaching notes open.

The announcement came over the speakers: "Women's Singles Semifinals, Court 2. Sophia Chen, Manitoba, first seed, versus Rachel Kim, British Columbia, defending national champion. Best of three games. First serve to Rachel Kim."

Rachel was taller than Sophia, athletic and powerful, confidence radiating from her stance. She'd won this tournament last year. She expected to win it again.

Sophia took her position, racket ready, expression calm.

The serve came hard and deep. Sophia returned it down the line, testing Rachel's backhand. The rally developed, both players probing for weakness.

Fifteen shots in, Rachel smashed. Sophia dove, got her racket on it, popped it high. Rachel smashed again, unreturnable.

1-0, Rachel.

"She's strong," Jordan murmured.

"Sophia's faster," Ethan said.

The match progressed, tight and competitive. Rachel's power against Sophia's speed and strategy. Every point felt earned, neither player giving anything easy.

At 8-7 Rachel, Sophia adjusted tactics. Instead of trying to match power, she started using angles, drop shots, deceptive clears. Making Rachel move, forcing errors, controlling tempo.

11-8, Sophia.

"There we go," Jordan said.

Rachel called timeout, conferred with her coach. When play resumed, she'd adjusted too, mixing up her shots, varying pace.

The first game stayed tight. 18-17 Sophia. 19-19. 20-19 Rachel. Game point.

Rachel's serve, hard and low. Sophia returned it, Rachel smashed, Sophia defended, Rachel smashed again. The shuttle seemed impossible to reach, but Sophia extended, barely got her racket on it, sent it looping back over the net.

Rachel moved forward for the kill shot, but the shuttle dropped short. She lunged, hit the net.

20-20.

Sophia's serve now. She kept it simple, deep and high. Rachel returned with a clear, Sophia dropped it short, Rachel ran forward, returned cross-court, Sophia was waiting, smashed down the line.

21-20, Sophia.

Game point again. Rachel's face showed frustration now, control slipping.

Long rally, back and forth, both players breathing hard. Then Sophia saw the opening, drop shot perfectly placed, Rachel ran but couldn't reach it.

21-19. Sophia took the first game.

In the bleachers, Ethan released breath he didn't know he'd been holding. Beside him, Jordan was grinning.

"One more game like that," Jordan said.

But the second game was different. Rachel came out aggressive, angry, determined. She'd lost the first game. She wasn't losing the match.

Her smashes found corners. Her serves caught Sophia off-guard. The power game that Sophia had neutralized in game one worked in game two.

10-5, Rachel.

15-9.

Sophia called timeout. Michael Chen met her at the side, water bottle and quiet words. Ethan couldn't hear what was said, but he saw Sophia nod, shake out her arms, refocus.

When play resumed, she was different. More patient. Defending everything, making Rachel work for every point. The power shots kept coming, but Sophia wasn't trying to match them anymore. She was surviving them, waiting for Rachel to make mistakes.

17-14, Rachel.

19-16.

20-17. Game point for Rachel.

But Sophia defended the kill shot, defended the next smash, defended until Rachel went for too much angle and hit it out.

20-18.

Sophia's serve. Rachel attacked it, Sophia defended, Rachel smashed, Sophia lobbed it high, Rachel smashed again, Sophia got under it, returned it, Rachel hit the net.

20-19.

The crowd was loud now, invested in the comeback.

But Rachel closed it out on the next point, smash that Sophia couldn't reach.

21-19. Rachel won the second game.

1-1. Third game to decide who went to finals.

Ethan's heart pounded. Jordan was leaning forward, elbows on knees, watching intently.

On the court, both players looked tired. This was the moment of truth. Whoever had more left, whoever wanted it more, whoever could push through fatigue and pressure.

The third game started cautiously, both players testing. 3-2 Sophia. 5-4 Rachel. 7-7.

Neither could establish dominance. Every point was a battle.

At 10-10, something shifted. Sophia found another gear. Maybe the crowd energy, maybe something internal, but she started moving faster, hitting harder, playing with certainty.

13-10 Sophia.

16-12.

18-14.

Rachel tried to rally, got two points back. 18-16. But Sophia closed the door. Three straight points, perfect execution, no mistakes.

21-16. Sophia won the semifinals.

The crowd erupted. Sophia bent over, hands on knees, breathing hard. Then she straightened, shook Rachel's hand at the net, thanked the officials.

As she left the court, her eyes found Ethan in the bleachers.

He was clapping, standing, overwhelmed with pride.

She'd done it. Beaten the defending champion. She was going to finals.

---

After the match, Ethan waited near the warm-up area. Officials and coaches moved around, preparing for the next matches. Sophia emerged from the athlete area, changed into warm-up clothes, hair damp from a quick shower.

She saw him and smiled, the exhausted but happy smile of someone who'd just won something important.

"That was incredible," Ethan said.

"Thanks. I can't believe you saw it."

"I wouldn't have missed it."

They stood there, aware of people watching, coaches and officials and other athletes. Not the place for the reunion they wanted.

Michael Chen approached, carrying Sophia's equipment bag. He looked at Ethan, expression complicated.

"That was a hell of a drive," he said.

"Six hours. Worth it."

"Your father's going to be furious."

"He already is."

Michael sighed. "You two need to be careful. Finals are tomorrow at 2 PM. Sophia needs to rest, recover, prepare. No distractions."

"I'm not a distraction," Ethan said.

"That's not what I meant." Michael's voice softened. "I'm glad you're here. I'm glad she has support. But tomorrow is the most important match of her life so far. Let her focus."

"I will."

"We're staying at a hotel near the venue. Team accommodations. Sophia needs to stay with the team tonight."

Sophia started to protest, but Michael raised a hand. "Non-negotiable. You have curfew, nutrition plan, strategy session. This is nationals, not a social visit."

"Dad—"

"Tomorrow after the match, you'll have time. Tonight, you're an athlete. Understood?"

She nodded reluctantly.

Jordan appeared with hotel information on his phone. "Ethan and I got a room a few blocks away. We'll be here tomorrow at 1 PM for warm-up."

"Good," Michael said. He looked at both of them. "I hope you know what you're risking. Both of you."

"We know," Ethan said.

Michael nodded, then guided Sophia back toward the team area. She looked back once, small wave, then disappeared into the building.

"Her dad's protective," Jordan observed.

"He's a lawyer. He understands what my father can do legally."

"Can he help?"

"I think he wants to. But it's complicated."

They left the sports centre, found their hotel, checked in. The room was basic but clean, two beds, view of Toronto traffic. Ethan showered, changed, tried to eat dinner, but his mind was elsewhere.

Tomorrow. Finals. National championship.

And somewhere in Michigan, his father was planning his next move.

Ethan's phone had been silent since they'd arrived in Toronto, which meant his father had moved past angry texts to strategic thinking. That was more dangerous.

But tomorrow, none of that mattered.

Tomorrow, Sophia was competing for gold.

And Ethan was going to watch her win.

---

Sunday, April 27th, 1:00 PM. The sports centre was more crowded than yesterday, finals drawing bigger audiences. Ethan and Jordan arrived early, found seats close to the court.

The bracket update showed Sophia's opponent: Amy Chen from Vancouver, no relation, who'd won the other semifinal yesterday in straight games.

At 1:30, athletes began warming up. Sophia appeared in competition gear, Team Manitoba uniform, hair braided back. She looked focused, in the zone, but when she spotted Ethan in the stands, she allowed herself a small smile.

He smiled back.

You've got this.

At 1:50, officials called finalists to the court. The announcement echoed through the facility: "Women's Singles National Championship Final. Sophia Chen, Manitoba, versus Amy Chen, Vancouver. Best of three games."

The stands were packed now, hundreds of spectators, cameras, live streaming setup. This was the highest level of badminton competition in Canada. The winner would be national champion, get funding, international competition opportunities, national team consideration.

The championship would be live-streamed on Badminton Canada's YouTube channel, archived for recruiting coaches and national team scouts to review. The stands were full of parents with phones raised, recording every point for personal archives and social media. Instagram stories and TikToks were already appearing with #NationalsFinals tags.

Ethan had turned off his Instagram account weeks ago, one less thing for his father to monitor. He wouldn't be posting celebration videos or tagging Sophia in victory photos. This moment would exist for them, not for public consumption.

Everything Sophia had trained for.

The match began.

Amy came out aggressive, powerful smashes, deep clears, testing Sophia immediately. First game started fast.

3-1 Amy.

5-2.

Sophia adjusted, started playing her game. Speed, angles, strategy. By 8-7, she'd taken the lead.

The first game was tight, both players elite level, neither giving ground easily. 18-17 Amy. 19-19. 20-19 Sophia.

Game point.

Sophia served, Amy returned hard, rally developed. Twelve shots, both players sprinting, diving, fighting. Then Sophia saw her moment, cross-court drop shot, perfectly weighted.

Amy lunged, couldn't reach it.

21-19. Sophia took the first game.

In the stands, Ethan breathed. One game up. One game away from gold.

But Amy wasn't done. The second game, she came out determined. Her smashes found corners, her defense was impenetrable.

8-4 Amy.

12-7.

Sophia called timeout, conferred with her coach. When she returned to the court, she looked calmer, more patient.

But Amy had momentum. She closed out the second game efficiently, clinical.

21-17 Amy.

1-1. Everything would be decided in the third game.

Ethan's heart hammered. Jordan was gripping the seat in front of him. Around them, the crowd was electric.

Third game. National championship on the line.

Both players looked tired, matches over two days taking their toll. But neither showed any sign of quitting.

The game started cautiously. 3-3. 6-5 Sophia. 8-7 Amy.

Neither could break away. Every point was earned, every rally exhausting.

At 11-10 Amy, they switched sides. Brief break, towels, water, both players breathing hard.

Play resumed.

Sophia started finding her rhythm. Her drop shots were landing perfectly, her defense reading Amy's smashes. She started pulling away.

14-11 Sophia.

16-12.

18-14.

Amy tried to rally, got one point back. 18-15. But Sophia was in control now, playing with confidence and precision.

19-15.

20-16.

Championship point.

Sophia served. Amy returned aggressively, trying to prevent the winning shot. Rally developed, long and brutal. Both players sprinting, both exhausted, both refusing to lose.

Twenty shots. Thirty. Sophia defending, defending, waiting for the opening.

Then she saw it. Amy slightly off-balance, recovering from a lunge.

Sophia's drop shot, perfectly placed, cross-court, untouchable.

Amy dove, fully extended, but couldn't reach it.

21-16.

Sophia won.

National Champion.

The crowd exploded. Sophia dropped her racket, bent over, hands on knees, lungs burning, legs shaking from exhaustion and adrenaline. The arena lights seemed too bright, sounds washing over her in waves—cheering, applause, her name being called.

Disbelief and joy crashed through her simultaneously. She'd done it. She'd actually done it.

Her coach reached her first—Coach Rivera sprinting onto the court, tears streaming down her face, pulling Sophia into a fierce embrace. "National champion! I knew you could do it!"

Then Maya tackled them both, screaming. Then the rest of the team—everyone crying and laughing and shouting. Sophia couldn't breathe but she didn't care, surrounded by teammates who'd supported her through three months of the hardest training of her life.

The weight of the moment hit her: national champion. The gold medal. The recognition. Everything she'd worked for since switching from hockey at age nine.

Officials were clapping, Amy crossing the court to shake her hand, genuine congratulations despite her own disappointment. "That was incredible. You earned it."

"Thank you," Sophia managed, voice hoarse from exertion. "You played amazing."

And in the stands, Ethan was standing, clapping, overwhelmed with pride and joy.

She'd done it.

National Champion.

All hers, earned through her own talent and work and determination.

---

The victory ceremony was ten minutes later, but first came the media gauntlet.

Photographers positioned Sophia with the trophy—heavy gold-plated metal that caught arena lights, Badminton Canada logo engraved on the base. She held it up, grinning so wide her face hurt, cameras clicking from every angle.

"Smile bigger! Hold it higher! Look this way!"

Behind the photographers, teammates held up phones recording TikToks and Instagram stories. Maya was already live-streaming, commentary breathless with excitement: "National champion, you guys! Sophia freaking Chen!"

The trophy was heavier than Sophia expected, substantial weight of accomplishment. Her arms shook slightly from match exhaustion, but she kept holding it up, kept smiling, this moment too important to let fatigue show.

"Team photo!" Coach Rivera called. Team Manitoba clustered around Sophia, trophy in the center, everyone grinning and crying. Multiple phones capturing the same moment from different angles, immortalizing victory for Instagram feeds and family albums and future recruiting portfolios.

Sophia's phone was somewhere in her equipment bag, buzzing constantly. She could imagine the flood: congratulations messages, social media notifications, texts from friends who'd watched the livestream. Later she'd scroll through it all, save the screenshots, reply to the messages.

But right now, she was living it.

She pulled out her phone briefly—one message she needed to see. Ethan's text: "NATIONAL CHAMPION. I knew you would. I'm so proud of you."

She was still smiling, still reading his message, still feeling the weight of the trophy in her hands when her mother's expression changed. When Jordan's hand gripped her shoulder with sudden urgency. When she looked up and saw Robert Price walking toward her across the arena floor.

---

The victory ceremony happened in a daze.

Three podiums set up on the court, bronze and silver finalists already in position. Sophia tried to refocus, tried to be present for this moment she'd worked three years to reach.

When they called her name for gold, she stepped onto the top podium. The official placed the gold medal around her neck—cold metal against her throat, red and white ribbon, maple leaf embossed on the face. The national anthem played, and she stood at the highest level of her sport, hand over heart.

Her eyes swept the crowd, found Ethan in the bleachers.

Their eye contact held across the distance.

This moment was hers. This achievement was hers. The medal was hers.

But Robert's presence in the building tainted everything, victory turning hollow before she'd even stepped off the podium.

The ceremony ended. Photographs, interviews, official business. Sophia moved through it mechanically, smile painted on, mind racing about what Robert's appearance meant.

Ethan waited near the lobby area with Jordan and her parents, their faces reflecting the same worry she felt.

Finally, she emerged from the athlete area, gold medal still around her neck, smile radiant.

Ethan met her halfway, and they hugged, fierce and relieved and celebrating.

"You did it," he said.

"I did it."

"National Champion."

"National Champion."

Jordan appeared with congratulations, then Michael and Helen Chen, both beaming with pride. For a few minutes, it was celebration, happiness, victory untainted by outside pressures.

Then Ethan's phone buzzed. Unknown number, Michigan area code.

He ignored it.

The phone buzzed again. Same number.

"You should answer that," Michael said quietly.

Ethan stepped away, answered. "Hello?"

"Ethan Price?" Professional voice, official.

"Yes?"

"This is David Morrison, representing Robert Price in the emancipation proceeding. Is your father with you?"

"No."

"I see. Are you currently in Toronto?"

Ethan's stomach tightened. "Why?"

"Your father is here. At the sports centre. He'd like to speak with you. Outside the main entrance."

The celebration froze.

"He's here?"

"Yes. He arrived an hour ago. If you could join him outside, that would be appreciated."

The call ended.

Ethan lowered the phone. Sophia was watching him, joy draining from her expression.

"What's wrong?"

"My father's here."

The words fell like stones.

"Here? In Toronto?"

"Outside. He wants to talk."

Michael's face went professional, lawyer mode. "Don't go alone."

"I'm not afraid of him."

"It's not about fear. It's about witnesses. I'll come with you."

Jordan nodded. "Me too."

They moved toward the entrance, celebration evaporating into dread. The lobby was still crowded with post-tournament athletes and families, but they cut through to the main doors.

Outside, under gray April sky threatening rain, Robert Price waited.

He wasn't alone. Two men in business attire stood with him—expensive suits, briefcases, professional demeanor radiating authority. Lawyers or investigators, Ethan guessed. Probably both.

His father's expression was controlled, cold, dangerous calm that was worse than anger.

"Ethan."

"Dad."

"You defied me."

"I came to watch Sophia compete."

"You chose her over your family."

"I chose to support someone I care about. That's not mutually exclusive with family."

His father stepped closer, voice dropping to barely above a whisper. Close enough that Ethan could smell his cologne—expensive, suffocating. The same cologne from every childhood memory, now associated only with threat.

"You left Michigan against my direct order. You ignored seventeen phone calls. You crossed international borders to be with her. You prioritized a relationship over your future, your family, everything I've built for you."

"I prioritized being a decent human being over your control."

Jordan moved to Ethan's side, protective stance. Michael Chen positioned himself between Robert and Sophia.

The unspoken battle lines drawn on a Toronto parking lot outside a badminton tournament.

One of the men with his father stepped forward, handed Ethan a document. "This is notification of change to your financial support status. Effective immediately, college funding is terminated. Your access to family accounts is revoked. You're financially independent as of today."

Ethan took the document, scanned it. Legal letterhead, official language, his father's signature.

"You're disowning me."

"I'm giving you what you wanted," his father said. "Independence. Adult responsibility. You think you can manage without my support? Prove it."

Michael stepped forward. "Robert, this is extreme."

"Stay out of this, Michael. This is between me and my son."

"This is between you and your need for control," Michael said. "You're punishing him for having autonomy."

"I'm teaching him consequences."

"You're destroying your relationship with him."

His father's expression didn't change. "If he wants a relationship, he knows what to do. Sign the NHL commitment. Respect the path I've laid for him. Otherwise, he's on his own."

Ethan found his voice. "The emancipation hearing is May 15th."

"I know."

"I'm still filing."

"I know that too." His father's smile was cold, sharp as broken glass. "You better hope you win. Because you're getting nothing from me after this. Not college, not housing, not support of any kind."

He turned to leave, the two professionals following like shadows. Five steps away, he stopped, looked back.

His eyes found Sophia—still in her Team Manitoba warm-up jacket, gold medal visible around her neck.

"Miss Chen," Robert said, voice pleasant, poisonous. "Congratulations on your championship. Impressive performance."

Sophia's hand found Ethan's, squeezed tight.

Robert's smile widened. "Enjoy it. Because after your eighteenth birthday, supporting a minor in defying his parents has legal implications. Criminal implications. My attorneys have been reviewing the statutes. Contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Interference with custody. Fascinating reading."

Michael Chen went rigid. "Robert, don't—"

"May 15th," Robert continued, ignoring Michael entirely. "The emancipation hearing. I'll see you both in court. And Sophia? I'd recommend consulting a criminal defense attorney. You're going to need one."

Then he was gone, disappearing into Toronto afternoon, leaving his threat hanging in the cold April air.

The parking lot felt silent despite traffic noise, other families loading into cars, normal life continuing around them while theirs imploded.

Ethan stood there, document in hand, world tilting.

Sophia appeared beside him, gold medal still around her neck, victory already feeling distant.

"What did he do?"

"Cut me off financially. Completely."

"Can he do that?"

"He just did."

Michael took the document, read it quickly. "This is legally binding. He's terminated all financial support effective immediately."

"So I'm independent now."

"Involuntarily, yes."

"Does that help with emancipation?"

"It complicates it. You're already unsupported, which removes one of the main reasons for emancipation. But it also proves his control tactics."

Ethan's mind raced. "If I'm financially independent already, do I still qualify for the MIT aid package?"

"You'd need the court to officially recognize your independence. That's the emancipation hearing."

"Which is May 15th."

"Right."

"And MIT's first payment is due June 30th."

"You're cutting it very close."

Jordan put a hand on Ethan's shoulder. "We'll figure it out."

But Ethan saw his father's strategy now. Cut him off, force financial desperation, make emancipation both necessary and difficult to prove. Make him dependent on Sophia's family, which would feed the "manipulation" narrative.

Every move calculated.

Every escape route narrowed.

Sophia took his hand. "We'll figure it out," she echoed Jordan's words.

Ethan looked at her—gold medal glinting in gray afternoon light, Team Manitoba jacket, national champion—and felt the weight of what his father had just done.

What he was threatening to do.

Criminal charges. Prison time. Sophia's MIT acceptance revoked. Engineering career destroyed before it started.

All because she'd supported him. All because she'd believed he deserved to choose his own future.

Last happy moment, his father had said.

The words echoed, prophetic and poisonous.

Sophia's face had gone pale, processing the threat. Her hand trembled in his, the gold medal around her neck suddenly feeling like a target, marking her as someone who'd achieved something beautiful right before Robert tried to destroy her for it.

"Let's get out of here," Ethan said, voice rough.

They left the sports centre, Toronto afternoon gray and cold despite being late April. The championship was won but the celebration was destroyed, victory tainted before Sophia had even left the building.

In the car—Jordan driving, Michael and Helen following in their own vehicle—Sophia stared at her gold medal.

National Champion. The title she'd worked three years to earn. The achievement that should have been pure joy, pure accomplishment.

Instead, it felt hollow. Dangerous. Like holding proof of everything Robert could take away.

Her phone buzzed. Instagram notifications flooding in—congratulations from friends, teammates celebrating, her championship photo being shared and liked and commented on.

Normal people having normal reactions to a normal victory.

While she processed the threat of criminal charges for the crime of supporting someone she cared about.

She turned off her phone and closed her eyes, gold medal cold against her throat.

National Champion.

And possibly, soon, criminal defendant.

The bill for freedom, she was learning, kept getting higher.

And payment was due in two weeks.
