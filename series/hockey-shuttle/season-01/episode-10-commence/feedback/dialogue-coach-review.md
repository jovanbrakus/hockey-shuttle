# Dialogue Coach Review: Episode 10 "Commence"
## The Boy Who Knew Me First Season 1 Finale

### Executive Summary

Episode 10 demonstrates strong character voice distinction and emotional authenticity in many scenes, but suffers from several dialogue issues that undermine the realism expected in YA contemporary fiction. The most significant problems include: overly articulate teenage speech patterns, on-the-nose emotional declarations, repetitive question-answer exchanges, and missed opportunities for subtext. While the episode succeeds in conveying the weight of major decisions, the dialogue often tells rather than shows emotional states.

---

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. OVERLY ARTICULATE TEENAGE SPEECH

**Problem:** Characters frequently speak in perfectly formed, grammatically correct sentences even during emotional moments. This is especially noticeable in Chapters 1 and 2.

**Example from Chapter 1:**
> ETHAN: "I've spent seventeen years being controlled and is just now figuring out what freedom means."

**Realistic Alternative:**
> ETHAN: "I've spent... god, basically my whole life with someone telling me what to do. I don't even know what it's like to just... decide stuff."

**Example from Chapter 2:**
> SOPHIA: "I think you're panicking. I think MIT is overwhelming and scary and the NHL is familiar and safe—"

**Realistic Alternative:**
> SOPHIA: "You're freaking out. MIT's scary as hell and hockey's... it's what you know, right?"

---

### 2. ON-THE-NOSE EMOTIONAL DECLARATIONS

**Problem:** Characters explicitly state their feelings rather than showing them through speech patterns, hesitations, or subtext.

**Example from Chapter 1:**
> ETHAN: "I'm terrified and relieved and completely overwhelmed."

**Better Approach:**
> ETHAN: "I don't know. I'm just—" *runs hands through hair* "It's a lot, you know? Like, everything's different but also the same and I can't—yeah. I'm okay. I think."

**Example from Chapter 6:**
> SOPHIA: "I'm scared."
> ETHAN: "Me too."

**More Nuanced:**
> SOPHIA: "My roommate asked if I was excited about classes tomorrow."
> ETHAN: "What'd you tell her?"
> SOPHIA: "That I needed to organize my notebooks. She laughed."
> ETHAN: "I alphabetized my pens earlier. Jay thinks I've lost it."

---

### 3. REPETITIVE DIALOGUE PATTERNS

**Problem:** Too many exchanges follow a predictable question-answer-question format, creating a tennis match effect rather than natural conversation.

**Example Pattern (appears 20+ times):**
- "What do you think?"
- "I don't know. What do you think?"
- "I asked you first."

**Better Flow:** Overlap, interruption, and indirect responses:
> SOPHIA: "So what are you—"
> ETHAN: "I have no idea."
> SOPHIA: "I was going to ask about dinner."
> ETHAN: "Oh. Still no idea."

---

### 4. MISSING TEENAGE SPEECH MARKERS

**Problem:** Dialogue lacks authentic teen language patterns including:
- Filler words (like, um, I mean, whatever)
- Interrupted thoughts
- Topic jumping
- Pop culture references
- Slang appropriate to 2025

**Example from Chapter 3 - Prom Shopping:**
Current:
> ETHAN: "I have no idea what I'm doing."
> SOPHIA: "You wear clothes every day. This is just... fancier clothes."

More Authentic:
> ETHAN: "I literally have no idea what I'm doing here."
> SOPHIA: "It's clothes? Like, fancy clothes, but still just... clothes."
> ETHAN: "Sophie, I wear the same three hoodies on rotation."
> SOPHIA: "Fair point."

---

### 5. PARENT DIALOGUE TOO PERFECT

**Problem:** Parent characters speak like therapists or life coaches rather than actual parents.

**Example from Chapter 1 - Mr. Liu:**
> "Emancipation means you're responsible for every decision now. Every consequence. There's no safety net."

More Realistic Dad Energy:
> "You know what you just did, right? You're on your own now. Really on your own. No one to blame if things go sideways."

---

## Specific Chapter Analysis

### Chapter 1: The Morning After
**Strengths:**
- Opening bedroom scene has good intimacy
- Caroline's divorce announcement lands well

**Weaknesses:**
- Sophie's parents' breakfast lecture is too composed
- Contract reading lacks realistic interruptions/confusion
- Missing teenage awkwardness about staying over

**Suggested Revision - Kitchen Scene:**
Instead of formal discussion, show discomfort through action and incomplete thoughts:
> DAD: *loudly rustling newspaper* "Coffee's fresh."
> ETHAN: "Thank you, Mr. Liu, I—"
> DAD: "Sophia tells me you're emancipated now."
> ETHAN: "Yes, sir. Yesterday."
> DAD: "Hmm." *more newspaper rustling* "Eggs?"

---

### Chapter 2: Decision Time
**Strengths:**
- Robert confrontation has good tension
- Jim Morrison's dialogue feels authentically professional

**Weaknesses:**
- Ethan's internal monologue comes out too articulated in dialogue
- Sophie's advice-giving is too wisdom-heavy
- Missing realistic reactions (swearing, physical responses to stress)

**Example Improvement:**
Current:
> "I think I'm afraid to choose MIT because people will think I'm crazy. And I'm afraid to choose the NHL because I'll lose myself."

Better:
> "I just... MIT feels like I'm letting everyone down, you know? Like I'm being stupid with the money. But the NHL is... god, it's like signing up to be Robert's dream again, just with different management."

---

### Chapter 3: Celebration Season
**Strengths:**
- Prom preparation excitement feels genuine
- Madison's mature acknowledgment works well

**Weaknesses:**
- Dialogue during slow dance is too polished
- Missing realistic prom awkwardness
- Group conversations lack overlapping voices

**Suggested Group Dynamic - After-Party:**
> JORDAN: "Yo, Mercer, you actually—"
> TEAMMATE 2: "—turned down how much?"
> ETHAN: "Can we not—"
> JORDAN: "Two point five MILLION—"
> TEAMMATE 3: "Bro, that's insane—"
> AMY: "Or genius, depending on—"
> JORDAN: "Nobody asked you, babe."
> AMY: "Nobody had to ask, I have opinions."

---

### Chapter 4: Graduation Day
**Strengths:**
- Valedictorian speech is appropriately formal
- Principal Harrison's voice is distinct

**Weaknesses:**
- Post-ceremony conversations too neat
- Missing the chaos of finding people after graduation
- Dinner conversation lacks natural family awkwardness

---

### Chapter 5: Summer Love
**Strengths:**
- Toronto training exhaustion comes through
- Phone conversations show distance well

**Weaknesses:**
- Coaching interactions with kids need more chaos
- Daily call summaries too perfect
- Missing miscommunications common in long-distance

**Better Phone Call:**
> SOPHIA: "—and then coach made us do suicides for twenty minutes because someone laughed during—"
> ETHAN: "Wait, what? You're breaking up."
> SOPHIA: "I said suicide drills! Can you hear—"
> ETHAN: "Sophie, you're literally just static now."
> SOPHIA: "I'll text you."

---

### Chapter 6: New Beginnings
**Strengths:**
- Maya's introduction is energetic and distinct
- MIT overwhelming feeling comes through

**Major Weaknesses:**
- First day at MIT dialogue too composed for the stress level
- Roommate conversations lack authentic dorm awkwardness
- Crisis conversations still too articulate

**Critical Scene Needing Revision - NHL Second Offer:**
Current:
> "I think hockey will always be there. Maybe not Detroit, maybe not $2.5 million, but I'm good enough to play if I want to. Jim Morrison said so himself."

More Realistic:
> "Hockey's not going anywhere, right? Like, if I'm good enough now, I'll still be good in four years. Maybe not NHL good, but... Jim literally said... he said there'd be other chances. Smaller chances, but still chances. God, why is this so hard?"

---

## Missed Opportunities for Subtext

### The Unspoken "I Love You" Pattern
Throughout the episode, characters say exactly what they mean. Consider this pattern instead:

**Current Approach:**
> "I love you."
> "I love you too."

**Subtext Approach:**
> "Drive safe."
> "I will. You too."
> "I don't drive."
> "Right. Walk safe then."
> "Ethan?"
> "Yeah?"
> "Nothing. Just... see you tomorrow."

---

## Dialogue Tag Issues

**Overuse of "said quietly," "said carefully," "said firmly"**

Better to show through:
- Interrupted speech
- Repeated words
- Silence before speaking
- Action beats replacing tags

---

## Recommendations for Immediate Improvement

### 1. Age-Down the Vocabulary
- Replace complex emotional vocabulary with simpler, fragmented expressions
- Add more "I don't know" and "maybe" and "like"
- Include failed attempts to articulate feelings

### 2. Increase Realistic Interruptions
- Characters cutting each other off
- Thoughts trailing into silence
- Starting sentences multiple times
- Talking over each other in group scenes

### 3. Physical Actions Instead of Dialogue Tags
- Fidgeting with objects during hard conversations
- Looking away instead of maintaining eye contact
- Movement replacing words

### 4. Authentic Teen Dynamics
- Inside jokes we don't fully understand
- References to things that happened off-page
- Texting while talking
- Code-switching between parent and peer conversations

### 5. Embrace Imperfect Communication
- Misunderstandings that don't get immediately resolved
- Things left unsaid
- Conversations that peter out without resolution
- Realistic phone/text miscommunications

## Specific Line Revisions Needed

### Chapter 1, Line 29:
**Current:** "I keep thinking I'll wake up and you'll have disappeared back into Robert's plan."
**Suggested:** "I keep thinking you'll just... be gone. Like this was all some weird dream."

### Chapter 2, Line 471:
**Current:** "Is this the life I want, or the life I was taught to want?"
**Suggested:** "Do I actually want this, or do I just think I'm supposed to want it?"

### Chapter 3, Line 112:
**Current:** "We've never been completely normal."
**Suggested:** "Normal's not really our thing anyway."

### Chapter 6, Line 667:
**Current:** "MIT is hard. Really hard. Some of you will struggle."
**Suggested:** "MIT's going to kick your ass. That's not a bug, it's a feature."

## Group Conversation Dynamics

The episode lacks authentic group conversation flow. Here's an example of improved dinner table dynamics:

**Current Style:** Sequential, organized responses
**Better Style:** Overlapping chaos

> DAD: "Pass the—"
> MOM: "Sophie, did you tell Ethan about—"
> SOPHIA: "Mom, not now—"
> CAROLINE: "Is this salt or sugar?"
> DAD: "—potatoes, please."
> ETHAN: "Tell me what?"
> MOM: "Nothing, just the thing with the—"
> SOPHIA: "It's nothing."
> CAROLINE: "Definitely salt."

---

## Final Assessment

**What's Working:**
- Distinct character motivations come through
- Emotional stakes are clear
- Major decision points have weight

**What Needs Improvement:**
- Dialogue authenticity for teenage characters
- Subtext and implication over explicit statement
- Natural conversation flow and interruption
- Realistic speech patterns under stress
- Group dynamics and overlapping voices

**Priority Revisions:**
1. Chapter 1 morning scene - too formal
2. Chapter 2 decision conversations - too articulate
3. Chapter 6 MIT arrival - needs more panic in the language
4. Throughout - reduce wisdom-speak from teenagers

---

## Success Metrics

After revision, dialogue should:
- Sound like actual 18-year-olds under pressure
- Include realistic hesitations and false starts
- Show emotional state through speech patterns, not declarations
- Create distinct voices without relying on catchphrases
- Build tension through what's NOT said

---

## Conclusion

Episode 10 has strong bones and clear character arcs, but the dialogue needs significant work to feel authentic to the YA audience. The primary focus should be on making characters sound like real teenagers facing impossible decisions, not young philosophers articulating their feelings with perfect clarity. Remember: confusion, fragments, and failed communication attempts are more realistic than eloquent emotional speeches.

The episode would benefit from a complete dialogue pass focusing on:
1. Reducing articulation in emotional moments
2. Adding authentic teen speech patterns
3. Increasing subtext and implication
4. Improving group conversation dynamics
5. Showing emotional state through speech disruption

With these revisions, the dialogue will match the high emotional stakes of the story and create the authenticity YA readers expect and deserve.
