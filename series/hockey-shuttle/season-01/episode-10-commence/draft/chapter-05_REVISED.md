# Chapter 5: Summer Love

The first week of summer felt like a gift we hadn't known we'd been waiting for.

No school. No crisis. No impossible decisions hanging over us. Just June in Winnipeg, warm and bright and completely normal.

Ethan started coaching at the youth hockey camp on July 2nd—teaching kids ages 6-10 basic skating and puck control. I showed up the first day to watch, curious about this version of him I'd never fully seen.

"Coach Ethan!" A tiny kid in oversized gear skated up to him, wobbling dramatically. "I can't stop!"

"That's because you're not using your edges." Ethan crouched down to the kid's level, demonstrated the proper technique. "See? Inside edge to stop. Outside edge to turn. Try it."

The kid tried. Failed. Tried again. Succeeded.

"I DID IT! COACH ETHAN, I DID IT!"

"You did! Now practice twenty more times."

I watched him work for an hour—patient, encouraging, completely different from the controlled, pressured version of Ethan that Robert had created. This Ethan loved hockey because it was fun. Because teaching small humans to skate was joyful. Because excellence could exist without pressure.

When one kid fell hard and started crying, Ethan sat on the ice with him. "You know what? I fell like that when I was your age. Except I also knocked out a tooth."

"Really?"

"Really. My mom still has the picture. I'm smiling with this huge gap in my mouth." He helped the kid up. "Falling is how you learn. Try again."

The kid tried again.

"You're good at this," I said afterward as he put away equipment.

"At hockey?"

"At teaching. At being patient. At making something you love accessible to kids who are just learning."

He smiled. "It's different when it's my choice. When I'm doing it because I want to, not because someone's forcing me."

"You look happy."

"I am happy." He locked the equipment shed, turned to face me fully. "For the first time in years, hockey is fun again. Just pure fun."

I started my own job that week—coaching badminton at the community center and tutoring math for summer school students. The badminton kids were enthusiastic but undisciplined, the math students were struggling but determined.

Ethan showed up one afternoon to watch me teach.

"Adjust your grip fifteen degrees clockwise," I told a twelve-year-old who couldn't get her serve right. "Your thumb should be here, not here."

"Why?"

"Because physics. The angle of contact determines the trajectory. If your angle is wrong, your trajectory will be wrong."

"You teach like an engineer," Ethan said after class.

"I am going to be an engineer."

"You know what I mean. Everything's systems and optimization. 'Adjust your grip angle fifteen degrees.'"

"That's how you improve. Precision and repetition."

"You're going to love MIT."

"We're both going to love MIT."

We fell into a rhythm—working during the day, meeting for lunch when schedules aligned, spending evenings together doing nothing in particular. Movies, walks, ice cream, the park. Normal teenage summer activities that felt extraordinary because we'd earned them.

On July 10th, we drove out to the lake with Jordan Chen and a group of Ethan's hockey friends. Someone's family had a cabin, and we'd been invited for a beach day.

I'd never done this before—the casual group hangout, the friends-of-boyfriend social scene. I was nervous.

"They're going to love you," Ethan assured me on the drive.

"They're your friends. They have to be nice to me."

"They're nice humans. They'll be nice because you're interesting and funny and excellent at everything."

Jordan's family cabin was right on the water—private beach, dock, perfect summer setup. By the time we arrived, there were already a dozen people there.

"MERCER!" Jordan shouted from the dock. "GET IN THE WATER!"

Ethan grinned. "Apparently we're swimming."

The afternoon dissolved into the kind of carefree chaos I'd only seen in movies. Swimming, volleyball, sunburn, laughter. Jordan's girlfriend—Amy, a theater major heading to Northwestern—immediately adopted me into the girls' group.

"You're the one from the valedictorian speech," she said. "The 'choosing yourself' thing. I loved that."

"Thanks. It was terrifying to deliver."

"Public speaking always is. But you nailed it." She passed me a volleyball. "Want to destroy the boys at beach volleyball?"

We did. Absolutely destroyed them. Amy and I on one team, two of Jordan's friends on the other. Ethan watched from the shore, grinning as I spiked the winning point.

"You're competitive," he said afterward.

"I'm a national badminton champion. Did you expect anything else?"

"Fair point."

As the sun set, someone built a fire on the beach. We roasted marshmallows and told stories and existed in that perfect teenage summer space where nothing mattered except the moment.

"What's MIT like?" Amy asked. "Jordan's twin is going there too. Computer science."

"We literally know nothing except that it's going to be hard," Ethan admitted.

"Rumor is the first semester is designed to break you," Jordan added. "Weed out the weak."

"Encouraging," I said.

"But you guys are smart. You'll be fine."

"Are we though?" Ethan asked. "Smart enough for MIT?"

"You got in, didn't you?"

"Lots of people get in. Not all of them survive."

Jordan threw a marshmallow at him. "Stop catastrophizing. You're going to be fine. Both of you."

Later, after the fire died down and people started drifting inside, Ethan and I walked along the beach.

"I'm going to miss this," he said.

"The lake?"

"Summer. Winnipeg. Normal." He picked up a smooth stone, skipped it across the water. "In seven weeks we'll be at MIT, and all of this will be memory."

"Good memory though."

"The best memory." He found my hand in the dark. "I've never had a normal summer before. Robert always had me in elite training camps or specialized programs. But this—hanging out with friends, working a job I chose, being with you—this is the summer I didn't know I was missing."

"We still have a month left."

"Minus your three weeks in Toronto."

Right. National training program. July 20th through August 10th. Twenty-one days apart.

"We'll survive three weeks," I said with more confidence than I felt.

"I know. But I'm going to miss you."

"Miss you too."

We stayed at the lake until midnight, then drove home under stars that seemed impossibly bright. Jordan and Amy fell asleep in the back seat, leaving Ethan and me alone in the front of his car.

The highway was empty at this hour. Dark. Just headlights and centerline and the low hum of the radio.

I watched Ethan drive—one hand on the wheel, profile illuminated by dashboard light, completely relaxed in a way I'd never seen during the school year. He caught me looking and smiled without taking his eyes off the road.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... you look different."

"Different how?"

"Happy. Light. Like you're not carrying anything heavy anymore."

He reached over, found my hand, threaded his fingers through mine. "That's because I'm not. For the first time in years, I get to just be myself."

The touch was casual—we'd held hands a hundred times. But something about the darkness, the privacy, the warmth of his palm against mine made my whole body suddenly, acutely aware of him. The space between us in the small car. The way his thumb traced absent circles on my wrist. How easy it would be to lean across the console and—

I looked away, feeling my face heat.

"You okay?" Ethan asked.

"Yeah. Just... tired." Liar. I wasn't tired. I was intensely, overwhelmingly aware of wanting to be closer to him. Of wanting more than hand-holding in a car with sleeping friends in the back seat.

The moment stretched. Ethan's fingers tightened slightly around mine. His thumb stopped its absent circling and pressed, deliberately, against the inside of my wrist where my pulse was racing.

He knew. Of course he knew.

Neither of us said anything. But something had shifted in the air—a tension that was new and terrifying and thrilling all at once.

By the time we pulled into my driveway, my heart was hammering and I didn't trust myself to speak.

"I'll text you tomorrow," Ethan said, voice lower than usual.

"Okay."

He walked me to my door. Kissed me goodnight—lingering longer than necessary, his hand at the small of my back pulling me closer. When we broke apart, we were both breathing harder.

"Sophie—"

"I know," I interrupted. "But not yet."

"Not yet," he agreed.

I watched him drive away, then went inside and sat on my bedroom floor, trying to process the ache of wanting more time, more privacy, more of everything.

Three weeks apart suddenly felt unbearable.

---

On July 15th, we started packing for our respective adventures.

Ethan helped me organize what I'd need for Toronto—badminton gear, clothes, training equipment. The national program had sent a detailed packing list that was both helpful and overwhelming.

"Three pairs of court shoes?" Ethan read from the list. "Why do you need three pairs?"

"Because when you're training eight hours a day, shoes wear out fast."

"Eight hours a day for three weeks straight. That's intense."

"That's national level." I folded another training shirt into my bag. "You think MIT's going to be less intense?"

"Fair point."

He was packing too—for a week-long hockey coaching certification course that started July 22nd. Not elite training, just professional development. His choice, his timeline, his career path.

"What if Toronto changes you?" he asked suddenly.

I stopped packing. "What?"

"Three weeks with the best badminton players in the country. Elite coaching. National team environment." He sat on my bed, looking uncertain. "What if you come back and you're different? What if you realize you want to go pro, defer MIT, commit to badminton full-time?"

"Is that what you're actually worried about?"

"I don't know. Maybe?" He ran his hands through his hair. "I chose MIT over the NHL. But you're better at badminton than I ever was at hockey. You could go pro. You could be great."

I sat down next to him, took his hand. "Ethan. Look at me."

He did.

"I'm going to Toronto to train. To get better. To see what elite level looks like." I squeezed his hand. "I'm not going to decide my entire future in three weeks. Neither are you. We're going to MIT in August. Together. That's the plan."

"But what if—"

"What if I love it? What if I'm amazing? What if the national team wants me?" I interrupted. "Then I'll have choices to make. But those are future choices, not right now choices."

"You're not going to defer MIT."

"I'm not going to defer MIT. I'm going to train for three weeks, learn everything I can, then come home and pack for Boston." I leaned against him. "Besides, you're the one who made me go. Remember? 'You have to do this, Sophie. Don't give up opportunities because of us.'"

He laughed. "I did say that."

"You did. So don't panic now."

"I'm not panicking."

"You're definitely panicking."

"Okay, I'm a little bit panicking." He wrapped an arm around me. "I just got you. I don't want to lose you."

"You're not going to lose me in three weeks."

"Promise?"

"Promise. Now help me pack before I forget something essential."

On July 19th—the night before I left for Toronto—both our families had dinner together at my house.

My parents, Caroline, Ethan, and me. The weird blended family we'd created through crisis and survival.

"To summer adventures," Dad toasted. "May they be challenging but not overwhelming."

"To growth," Caroline added. "And to coming home changed but not lost."

"To us," Ethan said, looking at me. "And to three weeks that will feel like forever but will pass anyway."

"To communication," I added. "Daily phone calls mandatory."

We ate and talked and laughed. Caroline told stories about her new job—she was apparently thriving, designing her first small project for the firm. My parents shared updates about their own work, their own lives beyond just being our support system.

"We're going to visit MIT in August," Mom announced. "Before you move in. Want to do a family tour?"

"Both families?" I asked.

"Both families," Caroline confirmed. "If that's okay with everyone?"

It was more than okay. It was perfect.

After dinner, Ethan and I escaped to the backyard while our parents cleaned up inside.

"Last night before you leave," he said.

"For three weeks. Not forever."

"I know. But still."

We sat on the porch steps, watching the July sky fade from blue to purple to dark. The air was warm, thick with summer evening—cut grass and distant barbecues and the faint sound of kids playing down the street.

"Are you nervous?" Ethan asked. "About Toronto?"

"Terrified. Everyone there will be better than me."

"You're a national champion."

"In the under-18 division. These are players who've been on national teams, who've competed internationally, who are legitimately elite." I picked at the paint on the porch railing. "I might be completely out of my depth."

"Or you might be exactly where you're supposed to be."

"How do you stay so confident?"

"I'm not confident. I'm just good at pretending." He bumped his shoulder against mine. "We're both going to be out of our depth a lot over the next few years. MIT, elite athletics, adult life. Might as well get used to it now."

"Encouraging."

"Honest."

We sat in silence as the first stars appeared. I wanted to memorize this—the feeling of sitting next to him, shoulders touching, nothing urgent or terrible demanding our attention. Just summer evening and quiet and being together.

"Call me when you land?" Ethan said finally.

"Obviously."

"And every day after?"

"Every single day. You're going to get sick of hearing from me."

"Impossible."

The porch light flickered on—Mom's subtle signal that it was getting late.

"I should go," Ethan said, but didn't move.

"Yeah."

"Sophie—" He turned to face me, and there was something intense in his expression. "I'm going to miss you so much."

"Three weeks. We've survived worse."

"I know. But this is different. Before, we were fighting something together. Now we're just... apart. Growing separately. And I'm terrified that when you come back, something will have changed."

"Something probably will change. We'll both learn things. Get better at stuff. That's the point." I took his hand. "But the important stuff? That's not changing."

He pulled me closer, wrapped both arms around me. I buried my face against his shoulder, breathing him in—soap and summer and something that was just Ethan.

"I'm going to call you so much you'll regret giving me your number," he murmured against my hair.

"Good. I want you annoying me every day."

We stayed like that until Caroline came to collect him. At my front door, Ethan kissed me goodnight—long and sweet and a little bit desperate, his hands cradling my face like I was something precious he was afraid to let go.

"I love you," he said.

He'd never said it quite like that before. Direct, simple, true.

My chest felt too full. "Love you too."

"Be amazing in Toronto."

"Be amazing in coaching class."

"Miss me."

"Every day."

He left. I watched his car disappear down the street, then went upstairs and sat on my bed surrounded by half-packed bags.

Tomorrow, summer would pause. We'd go our separate directions for the first time since getting together. Three weeks apart to grow individually before coming back together for MIT.

I was terrified.

I was excited.

Both were true, and both were valid.

**TORONTO: WEEK ONE**

The National Badminton Development Program was housed at a massive sports complex in downtown Toronto. Twenty athletes from across Canada, all between 16-18, all exceptional, all competing for limited spots on national teams.

I arrived at the residence hall on July 20th at 2 PM, dragging two suitcases of equipment and feeling completely out of place.

My roommate was already there—a girl named Priya from Vancouver, 17, ranked third in Canada in her age group.

"Sophia Liu!" She jumped up from her bed. "National champion! I watched your finals match online. That comeback in the third game was insane."

"You watched my match?"

"Everyone watches everyone here. We're all obsessed." She helped me with my bags. "Fair warning: this program is brutal. Like, actually brutal. Eight hours a day, six days a week. They're trying to break us."

"Encouraging."

"But also amazing. The coaching is incredible. If you survive, you'll be twice the player you are now."

The first training session was at 6 PM. All twenty athletes gathered in the main gymnasium, facing the head coach—a former Olympian named Coach Kim who had a reputation for being brilliant and unforgiving.

"Welcome," Coach Kim said without preamble. "You're here because you're good. But good isn't good enough for international competition. Over the next three weeks, we're going to make you great. Or we're going to break you trying. Some of you won't make it. That's fine. Better to discover your limits now than at the Olympics."

Encouraging start.

We trained until 9 PM. Footwork drills, serve practice, rally simulations, conditioning. I was good—had been the best player in Winnipeg by a significant margin.

Here, I was middle of the pack. Maybe.

The girl next to me—Emma, from Montreal—had footwork so fast she looked like she was gliding. The guy across the court—David, from Calgary—served with power I'd never seen up close. Every single person here was extraordinary.

And I was just... good.

After training, I collapsed in my dorm room. Every muscle ached. My brain was overwhelmed with technical feedback. My hands were shaking from exhaustion.

I called Ethan.

"How was day one?" he asked.

"I'm going to die."

"That good?"

"I'm average here, Ethan. Maybe below average. Everyone is so good. Like, scary good." My voice cracked embarrassingly. "I thought I was actually elite. Turns out I'm just a big fish who ended up in the ocean."

"You're a national champion."

"I was a national champion in a small division. This is different." I pressed my palm against my eyes, fighting stupid tears. "What if I don't belong here? What if they sent me the invitation by mistake?"

"Sophie. Listen to me." His voice was steady, grounding. "You belong there because you earned it. You won a national championship. You got invited based on performance, not luck. You're just intimidated because you're new."

"I'm so tired I can't think straight."

"Then stop thinking. Just sleep. Day two will be better."

"Promise?"

"Promise. Now go to bed before you fall asleep on the phone."

"Love you."

"Love you too. You've got this."

Day two was not better.

We started at 7 AM with conditioning—thirty minutes of ladder drills followed by suicide sprints. Then footwork training for ninety minutes. Then technical serve analysis. Then match simulations. Then video review. Then more conditioning.

By lunch, I was so exhausted I could barely hold my fork.

"This is normal," Priya said, shoveling food like she hadn't eaten in days. "First week is designed to break you. If you survive, your body adapts."

"What if I don't survive?"

"Then you go home with really good stories about that one time you trained with the national team."

I didn't want stories. I wanted to belong here.

Day three, my alarm went off at 6 AM and I genuinely couldn't move. My legs were lead. My arms were jelly. My brain was mush.

I called my mom instead of Ethan.

"I can't do this," I said when she answered. "I'm not good enough. Everyone here is better than me and I'm so tired I want to cry."

"Are you injured?" Mom asked calmly.

"No."

"Are you being treated badly?"

"No. The coaches are intense but fair."

"Then what you're experiencing is called being challenged. You've never been the worst player in the room before. It's uncomfortable."

"It's more than uncomfortable. It's humiliating."

"Sophia. You are seventeen years old, training with the best athletes in Canada, working toward a goal that requires excellence. You are supposed to be uncomfortable. That's how you grow."

I was crying now—stupid, frustrated, exhausted tears. "What if I fail?"

"Then you fail. You go to MIT, play club badminton, and remember that you tried." She paused. "Or you could trust that you're exactly where you're supposed to be, and give yourself more than three days before deciding you're not good enough."

After we hung up, I forced myself out of bed. Showered. Ate breakfast. Went to training.

Coach Kim pulled me aside after warm-up.

"Sophia. You look miserable."

"I'm just tired."

"You're comparing yourself to everyone else and losing." She crossed her arms. "Stop it. Your only competition here is yesterday's version of yourself. Are you better today than you were yesterday?"

I thought about it. "My footwork is faster."

"Then you're succeeding. Focus on that. Improvement, not comparison."

That conversation shifted something. I stopped watching Emma's perfect footwork and started working on my own. Stopped worrying about David's powerful serve and focused on improving my accuracy.

By day five, I could keep up with conditioning. By day six, I won a practice match against a girl from Toronto. By day seven, Coach Kim nodded at me after serve practice—silent approval that felt like a trophy.

That night, I video called Ethan. He looked happy and sunburned.

"How's coaching?" I asked.

"Amazing. Today I taught a six-year-old to do crossovers and she literally screamed with joy. It was the best thing ever."

"You love it."

"I really do. It's hockey without pressure. Just pure teaching and fun." He leaned back in his chair. "How's Toronto? Still miserable?"

"Actually... no. I'm adapting. My body figured out how to handle eight hours a day. My brain stopped panicking about being average and started focusing on improvement."

"See? Told you day two would be better."

"You said day two. This is day seven."

"I was off by five days. Close enough." He grinned. "Seriously though, I'm proud of you. Most people would have quit."

"I almost did. Called my mom crying on day three."

"But you didn't quit. That's what matters."

We talked until midnight—about his coaching certification program, my training details, nothing and everything. Just hearing his voice made the exhaustion bearable.

"Fourteen more days," I said before hanging up.

"Then you're home."

"Then we pack for MIT."

"Then everything changes again."

"I'm ready for everything to change."

"Me too. Love you, Sophie."

"Love you too."

---

**TORONTO: WEEK TWO**

By the start of week two, my body had adapted to the insane training schedule. I could wake up at 6 AM without wanting to die. My muscles recovered faster. My brain could process technical feedback even when exhausted.

But adaptation wasn't the same as thriving.

I was good. Competent. Improving. But I wasn't great. Not yet.

On day eight, we did match simulations—playing against different opponents in rotating rounds. I won some. Lost more. Every match revealed gaps in my game that needed fixing.

After my fourth loss of the day, I sat in the locker room fighting frustration.

Priya found me there. "You're overthinking."

"I'm getting my ass kicked."

"Because you're playing their game instead of yours." She sat down next to me. "You move different than everyone here. More calculated, less reactive. Stop trying to match their speed and use your brain instead."

"What do you mean?"

"You read the game like chess. They read it like instinct. Neither is better, but you're trying to be them instead of using what makes you different."

Day nine, I tried what Priya suggested. Instead of reacting faster, I started anticipating smarter. Watching opponent patterns, setting traps, using strategy instead of speed.

I won four matches in a row.

Coach Kim pulled me aside. "What changed?"

"I stopped competing with them and started playing my own game."

"That's the difference between good and great." She made a note on her clipboard. "Keep that up."

On day ten, everything fell apart.

We had a particularly brutal training day—three hours of match play in the morning, two hours of conditioning, then another three hours of technical drills. By dinner, I was so exhausted I felt nauseous.

I skipped dinner. Went back to my room. Tried to sleep.

Couldn't.

My brain was spinning with anxiety. About badminton, about MIT, about being good enough for any of it. The exhaustion made everything catastrophic—I was going to fail here, fail at MIT, fail at everything I'd ever tried.

At 9 PM, I called Ethan. He answered on the first ring.

"Hey—Sophie? You okay?"

"No." My voice cracked. "I can't... I just... everything is too much and I'm so tired and I don't know if I can do this."

"Do what? Toronto?"

"Any of it. This. MIT. All of it." I was crying now—full ugly sobbing. "What if I'm not actually smart enough or good enough for the life I'm trying to build? What if I'm just fooling myself?"

"Sophie, you're exhausted. You're not thinking straight."

"Maybe being exhausted is when I think most clearly. Maybe this whole thing—national training, MIT, trying to be excellent at everything—maybe it's all just me being delusional."

Silence on the other end.

"Ethan?"

"I'm here. Just... give me a second." He took a breath. "Okay. Listen. You are seventeen years old, training eight hours a day with the best athletes in Canada, preparing to attend the most competitive university in the country. You are allowed to be overwhelmed. You're allowed to be tired. You're allowed to question everything."

"But what if—"

"But," he continued firmly, "you are not allowed to make life-altering decisions at 9 PM on day ten when you're so exhausted you skipped dinner. You're not thinking clearly right now. You're catastrophizing because your brain is fried."

"I really miss you," I whispered.

"I miss you too. So much." His voice softened. "Do you want to quit Toronto? Actually quit, not just panic-quit?"

I thought about it. Really thought. "No. I want to finish."

"Then finish. Eleven more days. You can do eleven more days."

"What if I can't?"

"Then you call me crying and I'll talk you through it. Every single night if you need to."

I laughed wetly. "You're going to get sick of me."

"Impossible. Now promise me you'll eat something before bed."

"I promise."

"And Sophie? I love you. You're not delusional. You're just really fucking tired."

After we hung up, I forced myself to go to the common room and eat leftover pizza. Priya found me there.

"Rough day?"

"The worst."

"Day ten is when everyone breaks. You're right on schedule." She grabbed her own slice. "Tomorrow's easier. Day ten is the worst, then it gets better."

She was right. Day eleven, I woke up feeling more stable. Day twelve, I beat Emma in a practice match. Day thirteen, Coach Kim complimented my serve mechanics.

On day fourteen—exactly two weeks in—I felt like a different player than the one who'd arrived terrified and out of place.

That night, I called Ethan from the roof of the residence hall where some of us went to get cell service and see the city lights.

"You sound better," he said.

"I am better. I had a complete breakdown on day ten, but I survived."

"You called me crying."

"I called you catastrophizing. You talked me off the ledge."

"That's what I'm here for. Professional catastrophe management." He paused. "How much better are you? At badminton?"

I thought about it. "A lot better. Like, measurably better. My serve speed increased fifteen percent. My footwork is faster. My match strategy is smarter. If I played the version of me from two weeks ago, I'd destroy her."

"That's huge."

"It's kind of amazing actually. I didn't know I could improve this much in two weeks."

"You're going to be terrifying at MIT club badminton."

"How's coaching certification?"

"I passed everything. They offered me a job teaching at a hockey camp in August, but I turned it down because that's when we move to Boston."

"You turned down a job?"

"I turned down a job that conflicted with our timeline. Big difference." He laughed. "Old Ethan would have said yes and figured out the conflict later. New Ethan has priorities."

"I like New Ethan."

"New Ethan is obsessed with you and counting down days until you're home."

"Seven more days."

"166 hours. But who's counting?"

---

**TORONTO: WEEK THREE**

The final week had a different energy. We all knew this was ending. Three weeks of living and breathing badminton, then back to real life.

For some athletes, this was life—they'd go home and train full-time, pursue national team spots, commit to professional development.

For others, like me, this was a moment. Important, formative, but not forever.

On day sixteen, I had my best training day yet. Won every match simulation. Executed serves with precision I'd never achieved before. Felt completely in control of my game.

"Sophia, you've improved more in sixteen days than most athletes improve in six months," Coach Kim said after training. "What changed?"

"I stopped being intimidated and started being curious."

"Explain."

"The first week I was scared of failing. This week I started asking questions—why do they move that way, how do they read shots, what am I missing?" I grabbed water, caught my breath. "I stopped competing with them and started learning from them."

"That's the difference between good and great." She pulled me aside. "I want to talk to you about something. The national team selectors have been watching all of you. Several athletes are being invited to additional programming."

My heart rate picked up. "Okay."

"We'd like to invite you to winter training camp. December 26th through January 15th. Here in Toronto. Elite development with potential national team call-up after."

Three weeks spanning MIT's winter break. Doable, maybe.

"Can I think about it?"

"Of course. Let us know by September 1st."

I called Ethan immediately.

"They want me for winter training," I said without preamble.

"That's amazing! When?"

"December 26th through January 15th. Three weeks during winter break."

"So you'd miss New Year's with me."

"Yeah."

Silence.

"You should do it," Ethan said finally.

"You sure?"

"No. But you should do it anyway." He sighed. "We're both going to have opportunities that complicate things. This is yours. Take it."

"What if MIT winter break is when we need time together?"

"Then we'll figure it out. We always do."

But later that night, alone in my dorm room, I felt the weight of it. Another separation. More time apart. The constant balancing act of being excellent at multiple things while also trying to maintain a relationship.

I texted Ethan: *What if we can't actually do this?*

His response came immediately: *Do what?*

*Be good at everything. Be together. Not lose ourselves trying to balance it all.*

Three dots. Then: *We probably can't. Not perfectly. But we can try imperfectly and forgive ourselves when it's hard.*

*Is that enough?*

*It's all anyone can do. Call me?*

I called. We talked until 2 AM—about fears and futures and whether we were delusional to think we could maintain a relationship while both pursuing excellence at demanding things.

"Maybe we're idiots," I said.

"Definitely idiots. But we're committed idiots."

"What if being committed idiots isn't enough?"

"Then we'll fail spectacularly and at least have a good story." He paused. "But I don't think we're going to fail. I think we're going to struggle and fight and figure it out. Messily. That's different than failing."

Day seventeen, Priya asked me about winter training.

"Are you going to do it?"

"I don't know. It conflicts with time with Ethan."

"Do you want my opinion or just sympathy?"

"Opinion."

"You're seventeen. You're not married. This is the time to say yes to opportunities that make you better, even if they complicate your relationship." She shrugged. "If you guys can't survive you being excellent, then the relationship wasn't going to work anyway."

"Harsh."

"True though."

Day eighteen, we had an inter-program tournament—all twenty athletes competing in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. I made it to the semifinals in singles, finals in women's doubles with Priya as my partner.

Lost the finals match in three games, but it was close. Competitive. Proof I belonged here.

"You're going to be dangerous next year," Priya said afterward. "If you come back for winter training."

"Still deciding."

"Decide yes. You're too good not to push further."

On day nineteen, something happened that shifted everything.

I was scrolling Instagram between training sessions when I saw it—a photo Jordan had posted from another lake day. The whole friend group from July, except this time there was a girl I didn't recognize sitting in the spot I'd been in last time.

Right next to Ethan.

She was pretty. Blonde. Laughing at something he'd said. His arm was stretched along the back of the bench behind her—not around her, but close enough to make my stomach clench.

The caption: *Summer crew minus Sophie who's being an elite athlete in Toronto. @ethanmercer making new friends.*

I stared at the photo until my vision blurred.

This was stupid. It was just a group hangout. Jordan had tagged a dozen people. The girl was probably someone's girlfriend or cousin or random friend. Ethan and I were solid. I trusted him.

But also—he'd gone to another lake day without me. Made new friends. Sat next to a pretty blonde while I was eight hundred kilometers away training.

I called him.

"Hey! How was training?"

"Fine. Good. Whatever." I tried to sound casual. "Saw Jordan's Instagram. Looked fun."

"Oh yeah, we went back to the cabin for the afternoon. Super low-key." He paused. "You okay? You sound weird."

"Who's the blonde girl?"

Silence.

"What?"

"In the photo. Sitting next to you. Who is she?"

"Oh. That's Melissa. She's dating Jordan's friend Tyler. Why?"

"Just curious."

"Sophie." His voice changed. "Are you... are you jealous right now?"

"No. Maybe. I don't know." God, I sounded ridiculous. "It's stupid. Forget I said anything."

"It's not stupid. You're in Toronto training crazy hours, I'm here hanging out at lakes. That would make me feel weird too."

"I trust you."

"I know. But you're also human and tired and we've been apart for almost three weeks. You're allowed to feel insecure." He paused. "For the record, I sat next to Melissa because Tyler was on my other side and Jordan was across. I was literally boxed in. I spent the whole afternoon wishing you were there instead."

"Really?"

"Really. Also, she spent an hour talking about her boyfriend's gym routine. It was monumentally boring."

I laughed despite myself. "Okay."

"Okay." He softened. "Three more days. Then you're home and I'm not letting you out of my sight for at least a week."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

After we hung up, I felt stupid for being jealous. But also—Priya knocked on my door and found me staring at the photo.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Just being an idiot about my boyfriend hanging out with other girls while I'm gone."

She looked at the photo. "She's pretty."

"Not helping."

"But she's also clearly into the guy next to her, not your boyfriend. See how her body is angled?" She pointed. "Orientation toward Tyler, not Ethan. You're fine."

"When did you become a body language expert?"

"I have a brother your boyfriend's age who brings home attractive friends. I've learned to analyze threats."

"Is your brother single?"

"I'm not playing matchmaker while you spiral about Instagram photos."

Day twenty, Coach Kim gave a farewell speech at our final team dinner.

"You came here good. You're leaving great. Some of you will go on to represent Canada internationally. Some will play in college. Some will stop competing and just remember this as the summer you were excellent. All of those paths are valid. I'm proud of all of you."

After dinner, Priya and I walked around the Toronto waterfront.

"What are you going to do?" she asked. "National team track or MIT?"

"Both, somehow. I'll figure it out."

"You're crazy."

"Probably. But I'm not giving up either thing without trying."

"That's very you."

"Is that a compliment?"

"Absolutely."

Day twenty-one—final training session. We did a full simulation tournament, playing our hearts out one last time.

I won my bracket. Lost the overall finals to Emma, but it was competitive. Close.

Coach Kim pulled me aside after. "Winter training invitation still stands. You've proven you can compete at this level."

"I'll let you know by September."

"Good. You should come back. You've got something special."

I flew home on August 11th—exhausted, improved, changed.

Ethan met me at the airport with flowers and a smile that made everything worth it. When I saw him waiting at arrivals, something in my chest cracked open.

Three weeks. It had only been three weeks. But it felt like forever.

I dropped my bags and just hugged him—buried my face against his shoulder and breathed him in and felt the tension of separation finally release.

"You look different," he said when we finally broke apart.

"I am different. Stronger. Faster. Better at badminton."

"Still the same Sophie?"

"Still the same Sophie. Just evolved." I looked at him. "You look different too."

"Different how?"

"I don't know. More sure of yourself or something."

"Three weeks of doing what I love instead of what I'm forced to do. It changes you."

We drove home talking nonstop—three weeks condensed into ninety minutes of conversation. His coaching certification, my training evolution, the stupid Instagram photo jealousy that seemed absurd now that I could see him in person.

"You were jealous of Melissa?" He laughed. "She's literally engaged. She was showing everyone her ring."

"I couldn't see a ring in the photo!"

"Because it was on her other hand. Tyler proposed at the lake. That's why we were all there—celebrating their engagement."

"Oh my god, I'm an idiot."

"You're human. And tired. And I love you." He reached over, squeezed my hand. "For what it's worth, I spent the whole three weeks missing you and counting down days. There was never a competition."

At my house, my parents had a "Welcome Home" banner and my favorite dinner ready.

"We missed you," Mom said.

"Missed you too."

Caroline joined us for dinner—bringing updates about her architecture projects and the apartment she'd fully settled into. Robert was conspicuously absent from all conversations. The divorce was progressing. He'd apparently stopped trying to contact Ethan entirely.

"He's moved on to controlling something else," Caroline said. "Probably his golf game. I don't care anymore."

After dinner, Ethan and I escaped to the backyard.

"Four days until we leave for MIT," he said.

"Four days to pack everything we own."

"Four days to say goodbye to Winnipeg."

"Are you ready?"

He thought about it. "No. But I'm going anyway. You?"

"Same. Terrified and excited in equal measure."

"That seems to be our default state."

We sat in comfortable silence as summer evening settled around us. Three weeks apart had made this feel precious—the simple act of being together, shoulders touching, nothing demanding our attention.

"Thank you," I said.

"For what?"

"For making me go to Toronto. For supporting me even when it meant being apart. For not asking me to choose between you and opportunities."

"Back at you." He took my hand. "We both chose ourselves this summer. And we're still choosing each other. That's huge."

"It really is."

The next four days blurred together in a chaos of packing and goodbyes.

Packing for MIT meant figuring out what to bring to a new life—clothes for Boston weather, badminton gear, school supplies, photos of people who mattered, pieces of home to make a dorm room feel safe.

My parents helped. Caroline helped. Ethan and I helped each other, comparing lists and making sure we didn't forget essentials.

"Do we need winter coats?" Ethan asked.

"We're from Winnipeg moving to Boston. Yes, we need winter coats."

"But how cold does Boston actually get?"

"Cold enough. Pack the coat."

On August 14th—our last full day in Winnipeg—we did one final drive around the city.

Past the school we'd graduated from. Past the park where we'd had breakthrough conversations. Past the rink where everything had started, back when we were just kids who used to skate together.

"This city gave us everything," Ethan said.

"This city tried to kill us several times."

"True. But we survived. That counts for something."

We ended at The Forks—our spot, where the rivers meet and the city feels both huge and intimate.

"Last night in Winnipeg," I said.

"First night of everything else."

"Are we really doing this?"

"Flying to Boston tomorrow to start college at MIT? Yeah, we're really doing this."

I leaned against him, watching the sun set over the city that had challenged us and changed us.

"I'm scared," I admitted.

"Me too."

"But excited."

"Me too."

"Together though."

"Always together."

Tomorrow, we'd fly to Boston. Tomorrow, MIT would begin. Tomorrow, everything would change.

But tonight, we were still Winnipeg kids—survivors of impossible circumstances, graduates of hard lessons, ready for whatever came next.

Together.

Always together.
