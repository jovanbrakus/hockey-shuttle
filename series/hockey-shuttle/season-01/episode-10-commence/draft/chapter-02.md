# Chapter 2: Decision Time

The next two weeks moved in strange rhythms—simultaneously too fast and impossibly slow.

Ethan had sixteen days to make a decision that would define the next decade of his life. Every morning he woke up counting down. Every night he went to sleep no closer to certainty.

May 17th started with Robert.

Ethan's lawyer had advised him to meet in a public place, on his terms, with clear boundaries. So Ethan chose the upscale steakhouse downtown—expensive enough that Robert wouldn't make a scene, public enough that he couldn't try to physically control anything, neutral enough that neither of them had home advantage.

I offered to come with him. He said no.

"This is between me and him," Ethan said that morning over coffee at the shop near campus. Final exams were next week, but neither of us could focus on studying. "I need to face him alone. Prove I can."

"You don't have to prove anything."

"I do, though. To myself." He stirred his coffee absently. "If I can't stand up to him in a restaurant with witnesses, how am I supposed to make impossible decisions about my entire future?"

"Fair point."

"Besides, Caroline's coming with me. She'll be at a different table, but close enough." He smiled slightly. "Moral support from a distance."

"Your mom's brave."

"She filed for divorce from a man who's controlled her for seventeen years and moved into a hotel with two suitcases and a checking account he doesn't know about." Ethan's smile widened. "She's the bravest person I know."

The dinner was scheduled for seven o'clock. Ethan texted me at 6:58: *Going in. Wish me luck.*

I responded: *You don't need luck. You need boundaries. Hold them.*

At 7:47, my phone rang.

"How bad?" I asked without preamble.

"Bad." Ethan sounded exhausted. "He's... he brought a contract analyst. And a financial advisor. Turned dinner into a business presentation."

"About the NHL contract?"

"About everything I'm 'throwing away' by even considering MIT." I heard car sounds in the background—he was driving. "The analyst broke down exactly how much money I'd make over a ten-year NHL career versus a four-year degree. It's not even close, Sophie."

"Money isn't everything."

"It's $15-20 million dollars versus student debt and uncertainty." He sighed. "The numbers are real."

"So is living a life you actually chose."

"That's what I told him. He said I was being naive. That 'authentic self-actualization' doesn't pay for Caroline's divorce lawyer or buy houses or fund retirement."

I winced. "He's trying to make you responsible for your mom's financial security."

"He's good at finding pressure points." Ethan pulled into my driveway—I heard the engine cut off. "Can I come in? I don't want to be alone with my thoughts right now."

"Of course."

He looked drained when I opened the door. Still in the button-down shirt and slacks he'd worn to dinner, tie loosened, hair disheveled from running his hands through it.

"My father is extremely good at making terrible arguments sound reasonable," he said, collapsing onto the couch.

"What did he say?"

"That he understands I'm angry. That emancipation was an 'emotional decision' he respects even if he disagrees with it. That he wants what's best for me." Ethan stared at the ceiling. "Then he spent forty-five minutes explaining why what's best for me is signing with Detroit, deferring MIT for one year, and 'gaining maturity' before starting college."

"You can't defer MIT and play for Detroit. The contract explicitly prohibits it."

"I pointed that out. He said I could renegotiate that clause. That Detroit would be flexible for the right player." Ethan looked at me. "He made it sound so reasonable. So possible. Like I could have both if I just tried hard enough."

"But?"

"But I asked the Detroit scout about it yesterday. Jim Morrison was very clear—they're investing in a full-time player, not a part-time student. No deferrals. No compromises. Hockey only."

"So your father is lying to you."

"He's telling me what he wishes were true and hoping I won't fact-check him." Ethan sat up, rubbed his face. "The worst part? It almost worked. For like ten minutes, I was sitting there thinking maybe I could do both, maybe there was a middle path."

"What changed your mind?"

"Caroline." He smiled slightly. "She was at the next table over, supposedly reading a book but clearly listening. When Robert's analyst started talking about deferral options, she texted me: 'Call Jim. Verify. Don't trust him.'"

"She's good at this whole supportive mom thing."

"She's learning fast." His phone buzzed. He glanced at it and grimaced. "Robert. Again. Sixth call since I left the restaurant."

"You don't have to answer."

"I know." But he stared at the phone anyway, years of conditioning warring with newly won freedom.

I took the phone from his hand, set it face-down on the coffee table. "You met with him. You listened. You don't owe him more than that."

"He says we're not done talking."

"You say you are."

"It's not that simple."

"Yes, it is. You're emancipated. Conversations happen when you both agree to them, not when he demands them." I shifted to face him fully. "Ethan, what did you tell him? At the end of dinner? What did you say?"

"I thanked him for his time and input. I said I'd consider everything he'd presented." He met my eyes. "I did not say I'd sign the Detroit contract. I did not agree to defer MIT. I gave him nothing."

"How did he react?"

"Badly. He said if I don't sign by June 1st, I'm making the biggest mistake of my life and I shouldn't expect him to fix it when I fail." Ethan's voice went flat. "Then he said MIT would 'crush me' because I'm not as smart as I think I am, just adequately intelligent with good grades because he made sure I had the best tutors."

My hands clenched into fists. "He's trying to undermine your confidence."

"He's very good at it." Ethan pulled his phone back, scrolled through messages. "Look at this. He sent me articles about NHL players who went to college first and 'never reached their full potential.' Case studies of athletes who chose education over professional opportunity and 'regretted it for the rest of their lives.' Financial projections showing how much money I'd lose by waiting four years."

"He's campaigning."

"He's waging psychological warfare." Ethan set the phone down again. "And the terrifying thing is, some of his points are valid. The money is real. The opportunity is huge. Starting at eighteen versus twenty-two does make a difference in professional sports."

"But?"

"But I keep coming back to what you said on Saturday. Is this the life I want, or the life I was taught to want?" He leaned back, stared at the ceiling again. "I've spent two days thinking about that question. And I still don't know the answer."

Over the next week, Ethan worked methodically through his decision-making process like he was solving a complex engineering problem.

He made lists. Actual, detailed pro-and-con lists that covered both sides of my dining room table.

**MIT PROS:**
- Education with long-term value
- Multiple skill development
- Intellectual community
- Start college with Sophia
- Time to mature as person
- Keep playing hockey (club level)
- Flexibility to change directions
- Prove I'm more than an athlete
- Learn who I am without Robert
- Build life where I make decisions

**MIT CONS:**
- Walk away from $2.5M signing bonus
- Delay NHL dream 4+ years
- Might never get another offer
- Disappoint scouts who believed in me
- Robert's "I told you so" if I struggle
- Risk of not being smart enough
- Student debt (unless I get scholarships)
- Starting career at 22 instead of 18

**NHL PROS:**
- Financial security immediately
- Fulfill childhood dream
- Professional athlete at 18
- Prove I can make it at highest level
- Set up Caroline financially
- No student debt
- Start earning peak salary early
- Status and recognition
- Make scouts who invested in me proud

**NHL CONS:**
- Miss MIT opportunity (maybe forever)
- Leave Sophia for training camp/season
- All eggs in one basket (injury risk)
- Pressure to succeed immediately
- Prove Robert right
- Hockey 24/7 with no other development
- Short average career (5.5 years)
- No plan B if I get hurt
- Trade one form of control for another

On May 20th, I found him in the school library during study period, staring at these lists like they might spontaneously produce answers.

"Notice anything interesting?" I asked, sitting down across from him.

"My MIT cons are all about other people. My NHL cons are about me."

"Exactly what I was thinking."

He traced a finger down the NHL cons column. "Miss MIT opportunity. Leave Sophia. Injury risk. Pressure. Trade control. No plan B. All of these are about what I'd lose or what could go wrong for me personally."

"And your MIT cons?"

"Disappoint scouts. Robert's 'I told you so.' Walking away from money. Might not be smart enough." He looked up. "All about what other people will think or how I'll be perceived."

"So what does that tell you?"

"That I'm afraid of choosing MIT because other people will judge me for it. But I'm afraid of choosing the NHL because of what it would do to me." He sat back. "Those aren't equivalent fears."

"No, they're not."

He was quiet for a moment, thinking. "You asked me once which choice I was making because I wanted to and which I was making because I was afraid."

"I remember."

"I think I'm afraid to choose MIT because people will think I'm crazy. And I'm afraid to choose the NHL because I'll lose myself."

"Which fear matters more?"

"Mine. Always mine." He folded up the lists, set them aside. "Other people's opinions end. But I have to live with myself for the rest of my life."

Later that afternoon, Ethan got a call from Jim Morrison.

"Just checking in," the scout said. "You've got twelve days left. How are you feeling?"

"Honestly? Completely torn."

"That's fair. Can I ask what you're weighing?"

Ethan put him on speaker so I could hear. "Money and security versus education and growth. Immediate success versus long-term development. The known path versus the uncertain one."

"Those are all real considerations." Jim paused. "Can I be more honest with you than I probably should be?"

"Please."

"You're a smart kid, Ethan. Really smart. I read your academic record when we were scouting you. 4.2 GPA, MIT acceptance, math competition winner. You're not just a hockey player who happens to be decent at school. You're genuinely brilliant."

"Thank you, but—"

"Let me finish. I've been a scout for twelve years. I've seen hundreds of kids with your talent. Most of them signed early, played hard, burned out by their mid-twenties." Jim's voice got quieter. "You know what they all have in common? They wish they'd gone to college first."

Ethan's hand tightened around his phone. "All of them?"

"The smart ones. The ones who are thirty years old with two knee surgeries and no degree and no idea what to do next. They tell me, 'I wish I'd waited. I wish I'd gotten an education. I wish I'd had something to fall back on.'"

"How many of them got second chances? To go back to school?"

"Some. But it's harder at thirty with a family and medical bills and no recent academic experience." Jim sighed. "Look, I'm telling you this because I like you. And because Detroit will survive without you. We'll find another player. But you? If you pass up MIT, you might not get another shot at that particular opportunity."

"But I might not get another shot at the NHL either."

"True. But you're eighteen years old and talented as hell. If you want to play professional hockey at twenty-two, you'll have options. Different team, different contract, different numbers—but options." He paused. "MIT doesn't work that way. They don't just take anybody who reapplies four years later."

After the call ended, Ethan sat very still.

"He basically told you to turn them down," I said.

"He told me to choose honestly. To think long-term. To value education." Ethan looked at me. "He's trying to help me."

"He's trying to give you permission to choose yourself."

"Why would a scout do that? His job is to sign players."

"Maybe because he's been where you are. Made choices he regrets. And he doesn't want you to repeat his mistakes."

On May 22nd, Ethan met with Coach Williams—his high school hockey coach who'd been teaching him since he was fourteen.

He came to my house afterward with new information and fresh confusion.

"Coach played in the minors," Ethan said. "Did you know that?"

I didn't. "How long?"

"Three years. Got drafted by Vancouver, signed a contract, moved away from his girlfriend and his college acceptance." Ethan pulled out his phone, showed me photos Coach had shared. "He was twenty. Played hard. Got injured in his third season—torn ACL, complications, never fully recovered."

"What happened then?"

"He was twenty-three, washed up, no degree, no prospects. Spent five years figuring out what to do next. Eventually went to college, got a teaching degree, became a coach." Ethan scrolled through more photos. "He told me it was the hardest five years of his life. Watching his friends graduate and start careers while he was starting over."

"Did he regret going pro?"

"He said he regretted not having a backup plan. That hockey was his entire identity, and when it ended, he didn't know who he was." Ethan pocketed his phone. "He told me to go to MIT. To keep playing hockey but build a life that's bigger than one thing."

"What did you say?"

"I asked him if he'd choose differently if he could go back. He said yes without hesitation. He'd choose college first, hockey second, relationship always."

"The girlfriend he left?"

"They broke up after six months. Long distance plus pressure plus him being twenty and stupid, his words." Ethan smiled sadly. "He married someone else eventually, but he said he always wondered what would have happened if he'd chosen her the first time."

The conversations kept coming. Teachers. Former players. Caroline's new coworkers who'd made similar choices in their own fields. Everyone had stories. Everyone had regrets.

And almost everyone told Ethan the same thing: choose education. Choose growth. Choose the option that makes you more than one thing.

On May 24th, my badminton coach pulled me aside after practice.

"Sophia, you've been invited to the national training program."

I stopped mid-stretch. "What?"

"Summer intensive in Toronto. Elite coaching, national team players, Olympic preparation track." Coach handed me a folder. "It's selective. Only twenty athletes in the country. You're one of them."

I opened the folder with shaking hands. **National Badminton Development Program. Elite Summer Training. July 20th - August 10th.**

Three weeks. Right before MIT.

Right before moving to Boston with Ethan.

"This is incredible," I said carefully.

"It's career-defining. Athletes who go through this program have a direct path to national team selection." Coach watched my face. "But you'd have to commit. Three weeks, full-time. Miss any days and you're out."

"Can I think about it?"

"Of course. But I need an answer by June 1st."

The same deadline as Ethan's NHL decision. The universe had a twisted sense of timing.

I told Ethan that evening. We were at The Forks, walking the river trail, supposedly studying for finals but mostly just existing together.

"You have to do it," he said immediately.

"It's three weeks away from you. Right when we'd be packing for MIT."

"Sophie, you just won nationals. This is the logical next step."

"So is MIT. So is moving to Boston with you. So is—"

"So is all of it." He stopped walking, turned to face me. "You can't stop developing because we're together. That's not how this works."

"But the timing—"

"The timing sucks. But when does timing ever not suck?" He took my hands. "You're going to Toronto. You're training with the national team. You're taking this opportunity."

"We'd be apart all summer. Right after graduating. Right when we finally—"

"Right when we finally proved we can handle hard things," he interrupted. "Three weeks apart after everything we've survived? We'll be fine."

"You're sure?"

"I'm terrified. But yeah, I'm sure." He smiled. "Besides, if I choose MIT and you don't do the national program, you'll resent me for being the reason you didn't go. I know you well enough to know that."

He was right. I would.

"So we both choose what we actually want," I said. "And we trust that we're strong enough to handle it."

"Exactly. That's the whole point." He kissed my forehead. "We both choose ourselves first. And then we choose each other anyway."

"When did you get so wise?"

"I've been hanging out with this really smart badminton player. She's rubbing off on me."

On May 27th, Caroline invited Ethan to dinner at her new apartment.

She'd found a small one-bedroom in a quiet building near downtown. Modest, affordable, hers. Ethan helped her move in over the weekend—watching his mother build a life separate from Robert for the first time in seventeen years.

That Wednesday, she cooked dinner. Pasta and salad, nothing fancy, but made with care.

"I need to tell you something," Caroline said as they ate.

Ethan set down his fork. "That sounds ominous."

"It's not. It's just... honest." She took a breath. "I gave up architecture for your father. Did you know that?"

"You've mentioned you had a degree in architecture."

"I had more than a degree. I had a job offer. A really good one, with a firm in Vancouver. Designing sustainable buildings, working on projects I cared about." She smiled sadly. "But Robert wanted to stay in Winnipeg for his hockey management career. And he wanted a wife who was available, not one who worked sixty-hour weeks."

"He made you choose."

"He suggested it would be better for our family. Better for you, when you came along. Better for his career if I could support him fully." She pushed food around her plate. "I told myself it was my choice. That I was choosing family over career. But really? I was afraid."

"Of what?"

"Of finding out I wasn't good enough. If I never tried, I never had to fail." Caroline met his eyes. "I spent seventeen years wondering what would have happened if I'd been braver."

"Are you telling me not to make the same mistake?"

"I'm telling you that not choosing is still a choice. And living with regret is harder than living with the consequences of honest decisions."

They ate in silence for a moment.

"What would you have done?" Ethan asked. "If you could go back?"

"Architecture. Definitely." No hesitation. "The money would have been less steady, the hours would have been brutal, but it was mine. That matters more than I knew at twenty-five."

"Do you regret having me?"

"Never. Not for one second." She reached across and squeezed his hand. "But I regret not showing you that people can be multiple things. That you can be a parent and have a career. That you can love hockey and also love learning. That you don't have to sacrifice yourself to be excellent."

"You're showing me now."

"I'm trying. I got a job interview, did I tell you?"

Ethan's eyes widened. "Where?"

"Small architectural firm. They need someone with business management experience to help run the office side while the partners focus on design." She smiled. "It's not designing buildings. But it's in the field. It's a start."

"Mom, that's incredible."

"It's terrifying. I haven't worked in seventeen years. I don't know if I remember how."

"You'll remember. You're brilliant."

"I'm rusty and scared and completely out of my depth." She laughed. "But I'm doing it anyway. Because you showed me that scared doesn't mean impossible."

On May 31st—decision eve—Ethan showed up at my house at sunset.

"Tomorrow I have to call Detroit," he said.

"I know."

"I've made a decision."

My heart stopped. "Tell me."

"Can we walk first? I want to explain my reasoning."

We walked to the park, the same swings where we'd had this conversation two weeks earlier. The May evening was perfect—warm but not hot, light breeze, birds settling into trees for the night.

Ethan didn't sit on the swings. He paced.

"I've spent two weeks researching. Asking questions. Making lists. Talking to everyone who would listen." He kicked at the mulch. "And I keep coming back to the same conclusion."

"Which is?"

"I've been playing hockey since I was four years old. Seventeen years of skating, shooting, training, competing. I've been doing what other people tell me to do for just as long—coaches, trainers, Robert, always someone directing me."

"And?"

"And I'm good at it. Really good. The NHL offer proves that." He stopped pacing, faced me. "But here's what I realized at 3 AM last night: the NHL will always be there. Maybe not Detroit, maybe not $2.5 million, but I'm talented enough to play professionally if I want to. Jim Morrison said so. Coach Williams said so. Even Robert said so, back when he wasn't trying to control my decision."

"But?"

"But I might not always be smart enough for MIT. I got in now, at seventeen, with perfect timing and the right application and some luck. If I defer and reapply in four years? No guarantee. The opportunity is now."

My chest tightened. "You're choosing MIT."

"I'm choosing MIT." He said it firmly, certainly. "I'm choosing education first. I'm choosing to be more than just an athlete. I'm choosing to give myself time to figure out who I am when nobody's telling me what to be."

"Are you sure?"

"No. I'm absolutely terrified I'm making a massive mistake." He smiled slightly. "But I'm sure I made this choice for the right reasons. Not because of you, not because of Robert, not because I'm afraid of the NHL. But because when I imagine myself at twenty, twenty-five, thirty—I see someone who chose growth over money. Someone who built a life instead of just a career."

"Your dad is going to lose his mind."

"My dad already lost his mind. This is me finding mine."

I pulled him into a hug that lasted a long time. When we separated, he was crying—quiet tears that he didn't bother hiding.

"I'm walking away from $2.5 million dollars," he said.

"You're walking toward something better."

"How do you know?"

"Because you chose it. Really chose it. Not because someone told you to or because you were afraid not to. You chose it because it's what you actually want."

"I hope you're right."

"Me too."

We sat on the swings as the sun set, talking through his plan. Tomorrow morning, 9 AM, he'd call Jim Morrison. Thank him for the opportunity. Decline the contract. Then he'd call MIT admissions, confirm his enrollment, make it official.

"What about Robert?" I asked.

"What about him?"

"Are you going to tell him?"

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "I'll send him an email. Let him know I've made my decision. But I'm not asking for permission or approval. I'm informing him as a courtesy."

"He's going to call. Text. Show up places."

"Probably. But he can't control me anymore." Ethan looked at me. "That's the whole point of emancipation. I get to choose, and he gets to deal with it."

"Even if he's disappointed?"

"Especially if he's disappointed. His disappointment isn't my responsibility anymore."

We stayed at the park until dark, then walked back to my house. Tomorrow would be decision day. Tonight was just us, existing in the space between who he'd been and who he was choosing to become.

At my front door, he kissed me like he was sealing a promise.

"Thank you," he said.

"For what?"

"For showing me there's more than one way to be excellent. For not trying to make my decision for me. For being here while I figured it out."

"That's what partners do."

"Partners," he repeated, testing the word. "I like that."

"Better than 'the girl who made me choose MIT'?"

He laughed. "So much better. You didn't make me choose anything. You just asked the right questions until I could choose honestly."

"So what did I ask that helped?"

"Is this the life I want, or the life I was taught to want?" He said it like a prayer, like a truth he'd discovered and would carry forever. "That question changed everything."

June 1st dawned clear and bright.

I woke early, texted Ethan: *Today's the day. You got this.*

He responded immediately: *Terrified. But ready.*

At 9:00 AM, he called Jim Morrison from Caroline's apartment. She sat next to him, holding his free hand.

"Jim, it's Ethan Mercer."

"Ethan. Good morning. I assume you're calling with your decision?"

"Yes, sir." Ethan took a breath. "Thank you for the incredible opportunity. Thank you for your honesty and guidance over the past few weeks. But I'm going to have to decline Detroit's offer. I'm going to MIT."

Silence on the other end. Then: "Good for you, kid."

"You're not disappointed?"

"I'm a scout. I'm always disappointed when I don't sign a player I believe in." Jim laughed. "But I'm also a human being who's seen too many talented kids burn out. Go to MIT. Get your education. Keep playing hockey because you love it. And if you decide you want to go pro at twenty-two? Call me. I'll help you."

"Really?"

"Really. You're good enough to play whenever you're ready. Take your time getting ready."

"Thank you, sir. For everything."

"Good luck, Ethan. You're going to need it. MIT's brutal."

"So I've heard."

After he hung up, Caroline pulled him into a hug. "I'm so proud of you."

"I just turned down $2.5 million dollars."

"You just chose yourself. That's worth more."

At 9:15, Ethan called MIT admissions. Confirmed his enrollment. Made it official and irreversible.

At 9:20, he texted me: *It's done. I'm going to MIT.*

I was in the middle of my own call—accepting the national badminton training program, committing to Toronto in July.

I texted back: *Me too. MIT confirmed. We're doing this.*

At 9:30, Ethan sent an email to Robert:

*Dad,*

*I wanted to let you know that I've made my decision regarding the NHL contract. After careful consideration and consultation with advisors I trust, I've decided to decline Detroit's offer and attend MIT as planned.*

*I understand this isn't the choice you would make for me. But it's the choice I'm making for myself. I hope you can respect that, even if you don't agree with it.*

*I'm not asking for your approval or permission. I'm informing you as a courtesy because you're my father and you deserve to know.*

*I hope someday we can have a relationship that isn't based on you controlling my choices. But until then, I need space to figure out who I am without your input.*

*Ethan*

He showed me the email later, over lunch at our favorite coffee shop.

"Think he'll respond?" I asked.

"Oh, he'll respond. Probably with a novel about my terrible life choices and wasted potential."

Right on cue, Ethan's phone buzzed. Email from Robert. Subject line: "Disappointment."

Ethan looked at it, then put his phone away without reading it. "Not today. Today I'm celebrating."

"Celebrating what?"

"Everything. Choosing MIT. Choosing myself. Choosing a future I actually want." He raised his coffee cup. "To making decisions for the right reasons."

I clinked my cup against his. "To making decisions and dealing with the consequences later."

"To being terrified and doing it anyway."

"To freedom," I added. "Terrifying, overwhelming, beautiful freedom."

"To freedom," he echoed.

His phone kept buzzing. Email after email. Then calls. Then texts.

Robert was not taking the news well.

Ethan's phone finally rang with Caroline's number. He answered.

"Your father is at my apartment building," she said without preamble. "The front desk called. He's demanding to see you."

"Tell them not to let him up."

"Already did. But he's persistent."

"So am I." Ethan's jaw set. "I'm not seeing him today. He doesn't get to ruin this."

"What should I tell him?"

"Nothing. You don't owe him explanations either."

Caroline was quiet for a moment. "You're right. I'll call my lawyer. She can deal with him."

After she hung up, Ethan stared at his phone. "He showed up at her apartment."

"Trying to intimidate you."

"Trying to control me. Still. Even after emancipation, even after I made my choice." He set the phone down. "But it's done. I chose MIT. I sent the email. I'm not changing my mind because he's throwing a tantrum."

"Good."

"Is it though? What if he's right? What if I just made the biggest mistake of my life?"

"Then you made it honestly. And you'll learn from it." I reached across the table, took his hand. "But I don't think you did. I think you made the bravest choice of your life."

"Walking away from money is brave?"

"Walking toward uncertainty is brave. Choosing growth over guarantee is brave. Deciding that you're worth more than one thing is brave." I squeezed his hand. "You could have taken the easy path. The one everybody expected. The one that came with a check and a plan and no questions. But you chose the hard path. The one that makes you more than just Robert's hockey player."

His phone buzzed again. Text from Robert: *We need to talk.*

Ethan deleted it without responding.

"Ready for prom?" I asked, changing the subject deliberately.

He blinked at the non-sequitur. "What?"

"Prom. One week from tomorrow. June 7th. You asked me in April, remember?"

"Before everything exploded."

"Everything's always exploding. But we still have prom." I smiled. "Normal high school stuff. Dinner, dancing, pictures. You, me, and a completely normal date where nobody's making life-altering decisions."

"That sounds amazing."

"It will be. We earned it."

His phone buzzed again. This time, unknown number.

He answered cautiously. "Hello?"

"Ethan, this is Principal Harrison from Eastwood High."

Ethan's eyes widened. "Principal Harrison. Hi. Is everything okay?"

"Everything's fine. I'm actually calling with good news. We finalize graduation honors this week, and I wanted to inform you that you'll be graduating magna cum laude."

"I—thank you, sir."

"You earned it. 4.2 GPA, exceptional extracurriculars, MIT acceptance. You should be very proud." Principal paused. "I also heard through the grapevine that you chose MIT over a professional contract. Is that true?"

"Yes, sir. I made my decision this morning."

"That took courage. I hope you're proud of that too."

"I'm trying to be."

"Well, I am. And I think you're making a wise choice. Education lasts forever. Athletic careers are temporary." Principal Harrison chuckled. "Though between you and me, I'm disappointed you won't be making millions and donating to our athletics program."

Ethan laughed despite himself. "Maybe someday, sir."

"I'll hold you to that. Congratulations, Ethan. On all of it."

After he hung up, Ethan looked shell-shocked. "The principal called to congratulate me. On choosing MIT."

"See? Not everyone thinks you're crazy."

"Just my father."

"Your father thinks everyone's crazy if they don't do exactly what he wants. That's his problem, not yours."

We spent the rest of the afternoon at the park, studying for finals but mostly just existing in the relief of having made impossible choices and survived.

At 4:30, Sophia's phone rang. National team coordinator.

"Ms. Liu, I'm calling to confirm we received your acceptance for the summer training program."

"Yes, ma'am. I submitted it this morning."

"Wonderful. We're thrilled to have you. You'll receive information packets next week with details about housing, schedule, and what to bring." The coordinator paused. "I should mention—this program has launched several Olympic careers. If you're serious about competitive badminton, this is your path."

After she hung up, I looked at Ethan. "Olympic path. That's what she said."

"Are you serious about competitive badminton?"

"I'm serious about being excellent at what I choose to do. Whether that leads to Olympics or just personal satisfaction, I haven't decided yet."

"Fair enough."

"But I'm also serious about MIT. And about us. And about figuring out how to be multiple things at once."

"We're quite a pair," Ethan said. "Both choosing complicated over simple."

"Both choosing honest over easy."

"Both choosing ourselves over other people's expectations."

I leaned against him, watched clouds move across the afternoon sky. "Do you think we'll regret it?"

"I think we might. Sometimes. When it's hard and we're exhausted and the people who took the money or the guaranteed path seem happier." He wrapped an arm around my shoulders. "But I think we'd regret not trying more than we'd regret trying and failing."

"When did you get so philosophical?"

"When I spent two weeks making an impossible decision and realized there's no such thing as a perfect choice. Just honest ones and dishonest ones."

His phone buzzed one more time. Text from Robert: *You just threw away your future.*

Ethan looked at it for a long moment, then did something I'd never seen him do before: he deleted his father's contact entirely. No number, no email, no connection.

"What did you just do?" I asked.

"Cut the cord. Completely." He set his phone down. "He doesn't get space in my head anymore. He doesn't get to live rent-free in my anxiety. He's done."

"You can do that? Just... delete him?"

"I'm emancipated. I chose MIT. I chose myself." Ethan looked at me. "He can be disappointed all he wants. But it's not my job to manage his feelings anymore."

"That's incredibly healthy."

"That's incredibly terrifying." He laughed shakily. "I have no idea if I'm doing this right."

"Nobody does. We're all just pretending."

"Your parents seem to have it figured out."

"They're forty-five and still learning." I stood up, offered him my hand. "Come on. Let's go do something celebratory."

"Like what?"

"I don't know. Ice cream? Movies? Something normal that normal teenagers do when they're not making life-altering decisions."

We ended up at the ice cream shop near campus, eating ridiculous sundaes and laughing about nothing important. Normal. Easy. Ours.

At 7 PM, Maya called me. "I heard you're coming to MIT!"

"How did you—"

"I follow admissions groups. Someone posted about the hockey player who turned down the NHL. Put two and two together." She sounded delighted. "Please tell me you're doing the badminton team."

"Club team, probably. I'm focusing on academics first."

"Same! Track for me, but club level. We're going to be such good friends, I can already tell."

After I hung up, Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Making friends before we even get there?"

"Apparently. Maya's... a lot. But in a good way, I think."

"I got an email from my roommate assignment," Ethan said. "Guy named Jay Patterson. Computer science major from Austin. Sent me a very formal message introducing himself and asking about my 'comfort level with ambient noise.'"

"That's very specific."

"Engineers are specific people. We're going to fit right in."

His phone buzzed. This time, Caroline.

"Robert's lawyer sent me a letter," she said when Ethan answered. "Threatening to contest the divorce if I don't 'convince you to reconsider your reckless decision.'"

"He's using you to get to me."

"I'm aware. My lawyer says it's an empty threat—the emancipation and my filing are separate legal matters. But I wanted you to know." She paused. "Are you okay?"

"I'm great, actually. I chose MIT, ate ice cream with my girlfriend, and I'm living the most normal teenage evening of my entire life."

Caroline laughed. "Good. Don't let him steal that from you."

"I won't. He doesn't have that power anymore."

When he hung up, I asked, "Is he going to keep doing this? Trying to manipulate through your mom?"

"Probably. Until he realizes it doesn't work." Ethan finished his ice cream. "But that's his problem. My problem is figuring out what classes to take first semester and whether I'm ready for MIT-level physics."

"That's a much better problem to have."

"Agreed."

We walked home as the sun set, the day winding down the same way it started—with choices made and consequences accepted and the future stretching out uncertain and terrifying and completely, beautifully ours.

At my front door, Ethan kissed me goodbye like he was celebrating freedom.

"Tomorrow: prom shopping?" I asked.

"Tomorrow: prom shopping. Then finals. Then graduation. Then summer. Then MIT." He counted on his fingers. "Then everything else."

"Then everything else," I agreed.

He left smiling—really smiling, for the first time in weeks. The weight of the decision was gone. The choice was made. The path was chosen.

Not the easy path. Not the obvious path. Not the path everyone expected.

But his path. Chosen honestly. Owned completely.

And that was everything.
