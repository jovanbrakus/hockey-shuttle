# Chapter 4: Graduation Day

June 28th dawned clear and bright—the kind of perfect Manitoba summer day that felt like a gift.

I woke at 7 AM to my mother already bustling around the house, emotional before the ceremony had even started.

"It's just graduation," I said from the kitchen doorway. "I'll still be here all summer."

"It's not just graduation. It's the end of childhood." She wiped her eyes. "Tomorrow you're an adult. Today you're still my baby."

"Mom."

"Let me be emotional. I've earned it."

Dad appeared with coffee and a knowing smile. "She's been crying since 6 AM. Just let it happen."

At 8:30, I put on my cap and gown. Royal blue polyester that made everyone look the same—which was perhaps the point. 247 graduating seniors, all wearing identical robes, all moving into uncertain futures.

The cap wouldn't sit right on my head. I'd spent an hour last night figuring out how to pin it so my hair wouldn't destroy it, but it still felt precarious.

My phone buzzed. Ethan: *This cap is ridiculous. How does anyone keep these on their head?*

I responded: *Bobby pins. Many bobby pins.*

*I don't have bobby pins.*

*Then prepare for your cap to fall off during the ceremony.*

*Great. I'll look stupid in all the photos.*

*You'll look fine. See you there.*

The ceremony was at 11 AM, held on the football field because we were too many graduates to fit in the gymnasium. Families were already gathering in the stands when I arrived at 10:15—parents, grandparents, siblings, everyone dressed up and carrying flowers and cameras.

The staging area behind the bleachers was controlled chaos. Two hundred forty-seven seniors trying to line up alphabetically while teachers barked instructions and everyone adjusted caps and took selfies.

I found my place in line—"L" section, between Lamar and Lopez. Ethan was somewhere in the "M"s, probably fifteen people behind me.

I turned to look for him and caught his eye across the crowd. He was already in his robe, cap sitting crooked on his head just like I'd predicted. He gave me a small wave and a crooked smile.

Jordan Chen, standing near Ethan, shouted across the staging area: "LAST TIME WE'RE ALL TOGETHER, PEOPLE!"

Someone else yelled back: "DON'T MAKE IT WEIRD, CHEN!"

But it was weird. This was the last time we'd all be in the same place. By September, we'd be scattered across the country—different colleges, different jobs, different lives. Some of us would stay in touch. Most wouldn't. That's how high school worked.

"Where are you going in the fall?" Marcus Lamar asked me.

"MIT. You?"

"University of Toronto. Engineering." He grinned. "Guess we're both nerds."

"The best kind of people."

Alicia Lopez leaned in. "I'm going to UBC for environmental science. I literally cannot wait to leave Manitoba."

Around us, similar conversations were happening. College destinations like battle statistics—who got into where, who was staying local, who was going the farthest. Maya Chen was headed to Stanford. Jordan to UBC with Alicia. Amy Rodriguez to McGill.

Everyone scattering. Everyone moving forward.

Principal Harrison appeared with a megaphone. "SENIORS! LISTEN UP!"

The chaos quieted slightly.

"In fifteen minutes, we begin the processional. When I call your row, you walk in pairs down the center aisle. Don't run, don't trip, don't do anything stupid that ends up on social media." He looked directly at Jordan. "I'm talking to you, Chen."

"I would never, sir!"

"You absolutely would. Don't."

My stomach started doing nervous flips. In less than two hours, I'd be standing in front of 800 people giving the valedictorian speech. The speech I'd written and rewritten seventeen times. The speech I'd memorized but now couldn't remember the opening line of.

What was the opening line?

*When Principal Harrison asked me to be valedictorian speaker, I almost said no.*

Okay. I remembered. I was fine.

Except my hands were shaking.

At 10:45, music started. Pomp and Circumstance, the classic graduation march. Cliché and perfect.

"ROW ONE, GO!"

The first students began walking. Slowly, methodically, we moved forward.

My heart hammered. Speech in less than an hour. Don't think about it. Just walk.

I walked with Alicia Lopez, a girl I'd had exactly three conversations with in four years. We smiled at each other nervously, two strangers sharing a significant moment.

The football field opened up before us—rows of white chairs, stands packed with families, teachers in their academic regalia sitting on the stage, Principal Harrison at the podium.

I found my parents in the crowd immediately. Mom was already crying. Dad had his camera ready.

Next to them: Caroline. She'd come alone.

Robert's seat was empty.

The absence hit like a physical thing—a hole in the stands where a father should be. For Ethan, that empty space probably felt like relief and loss all tangled together. The man who'd controlled his entire life, who'd mapped his future without asking, who'd hurt Caroline and manipulated Ethan and made everything about hockey—he wasn't here to see his son graduate.

Part of me was glad. Most of me was glad. But a small part ached for Ethan, because that empty seat meant Robert had chosen pride over love, control over presence. Even when faced with his son's biggest achievements, he couldn't show up.

Caroline waved when she caught my eye, beaming with pride. Making up for the empty seat beside her with double the enthusiasm.

I took my seat in the third row, "L" section. Ethan would be a few rows back. I couldn't turn around without being obvious, so I sat straight and waited.

My note cards were in my robe pocket. I touched them compulsively. Still there. Backup plan if my brain short-circuited.

The processional took twenty minutes. Two hundred forty-seven students filing in, finding seats, settling. When the last senior sat down, Principal Harrison approached the microphone.

"Welcome, families and friends, to the graduation ceremony for Eastwood High School, Class of 2025."

The crowd applauded.

"Today we celebrate 247 exceptional young people who have earned the right to stand here. They've completed four years of rigorous academics, demonstrated excellence in activities and athletics, and proven themselves ready for whatever comes next."

He continued with the standard graduation speech—overcoming challenges, bright futures, endless possibilities. I'd heard versions of this speech dozens of times. But today, sitting in my blue robe with my bobby-pinned cap, it felt different.

This was actually happening. We were actually graduating.

My mouth was dry. Speech coming. Why had I agreed to this?

"Before we begin conferring diplomas," Principal Harrison said, "we have several students speaking today. First, our valedictorian, Sophia Liu."

My stomach dropped.

I stood. My legs worked, somehow. I walked to the stage, climbed the steps, took my place behind the microphone.

Eight hundred faces looking at me. Maybe more.

Deep breath. Look at the audience. Find friendly faces.

Mom: crying. Dad: proud. Caroline: encouraging.

And Ethan—I found him in the M section. Sitting forward in his seat, completely focused on me like I was the only person in the world. His expression was open, proud, full of something that made my throat tight.

I pulled out my note cards—backup in case my brain stopped working. But I'd memorized every word.

"Good morning, graduates, families, teachers, and distinguished guests."

My voice echoed across the field. Surprisingly steady, though my hands gripped the podium like it was the only thing keeping me upright.

"When Principal Harrison asked me to be valedictorian speaker, I almost said no."

Scattered laughter from the audience. My shoulders relaxed slightly.

"Not because I don't have things to say—anyone who knows me knows I always have things to say—but because I've only been at this school for nine months. Nine months. Most of you have known each other since kindergarten."

I made eye contact with classmates in the front rows.

"But then I realized: maybe that's exactly why I should speak. Because I've seen this place with fresh eyes. And what I've seen is extraordinary.

"I moved to Winnipeg in September from a smaller town where I was the badminton girl. Here, I became the new girl, the scholarship student, the one who didn't know anyone. I expected to be lonely. Instead, I found something I didn't know I was looking for.

"I found a community that celebrates excellence in all its forms. Athletes and artists, scientists and musicians, writers and builders. I found teachers who genuinely care whether we understand, not just whether we pass. I found classmates who pushed me to be better, even when I didn't think I could be."

I paused. Looked directly at Ethan.

His throat worked. He was blinking more than normal. Proud and moved and present in a way that made my chest ache with love.

"But most importantly, I learned something about choosing yourself.

"This year, many of us faced impossible choices. College or career. Safety or dreams. What others expect versus what we actually want. And here's what I learned: the only wrong choice is the one you make for someone else."

Several parents were nodding. Several students were listening more intently.

Ethan's hands were clasped in his lap, white-knuckled. Watching me like I was saying something that mattered more than words usually did.

"Some of us are going to Ivy League schools. Some are joining the military. Some are starting businesses, taking gap years, going to community college, starting families, or pursuing professional sports. Every single path is valid if it's genuinely yours."

I glanced at my note cards. Didn't need them.

"I'm going to MIT in August—and yes, I'm terrified. I'm leaving behind a sport I love, a city I've grown to care about, and all the safety of what I know. But I'm choosing it. Not because it's what my parents want, though they're supportive. Not because it looks good on paper. But because when I imagine my future, this is the one that makes me excited instead of just secure."

More nodding. Caroline was outright crying now. Mom too.

And Ethan—his chest was rising and falling like he was trying to keep his breathing steady. Like my words were hitting somewhere deep.

"And I learned this from watching all of you. The artist who chose Parsons over pre-med. The hockey player who chose education over professional contracts."

I didn't look at Ethan. Didn't need to. Everyone knew who I meant.

But I felt the moment land. Felt him hear it—hear me tell 800 people that his choice was brave, not wasteful. That choosing yourself over others' expectations wasn't selfish. It was courageous.

His eyes were wet. I could see that from here.

"The musician who chose Berklee over business school. The writer who chose to take a year to write instead of rushing to college. You taught me that courage isn't about making the biggest choice or the most impressive choice. It's about making the honest choice.

"So here's my challenge for all of us: In five years, ten years, twenty years—when we're living whatever lives we've built—I hope we can look back and say 'I chose this. Not my parents, not my teachers, not society's expectations. Me.'

"Because that's what graduation really means. Not that we've finished something, but that we're finally free to begin."

I gripped the podium harder, feeling the weight of 247 pairs of eyes. My voice almost broke on the next words but I pushed through.

"To the Class of 2025: We made it. Not just through classes and exams and social drama, but through a year that tested us in ways we didn't expect. We're stronger than we knew. Braver than we believed. And ready for whatever comes next.

"Thank you, and congratulations."

I stepped back from the microphone.

For one heartbeat, silence.

Then applause. Sustained, loud, genuine applause. People standing. Not everyone, but enough.

I made it back to my seat somehow, shaking slightly from adrenaline. Alicia Lopez whispered, "That was amazing."

I couldn't speak. Just nodded.

From several rows back, I felt Ethan's gaze. When I glanced back—breaking staging protocol—he was still looking at me. Pride written all over his face. Love, too, though he couldn't say it in this crowded field. His expression said everything: *You were incredible. Every word. Thank you for seeing me.*

Principal Harrison returned to the podium. "Thank you, Ms. Liu, for those inspiring words. Now, we'll begin conferring diplomas. When you hear your name, please come to the stage."

The next hour was a blur of names.

"Andrew Abbott." Applause. Walk across stage. Shake hands. Receive diploma. Pose for photo. Return to seat.

"Jennifer Adams." Repeat.

"Marcus Anderson." Repeat.

The alphabet progressed. I waited through the B's, C's, D's, E's, F's, G's, H's, I's, J's, K's.

Then: "Sophia Marie Liu."

I stood. Walked to the stage for the second time.

Principal Harrison shook my hand. "Graduating summa cum laude, national badminton champion, attending MIT."

The crowd applauded—louder for me because of the valedictorian speech. I accepted my diploma, posed for the official photo, scanned the crowd.

Mom and Dad: on their feet, applauding. Caroline: also standing, beaming.

I returned to my seat, diploma in hand. Official proof that I'd completed high school. Official permission to move forward.

The M's came quickly.

"Ethan James Mercer."

My heart jumped.

Ethan walked to the stage with athletic grace, even in the ridiculous blue robe. His cap had stayed on—miraculous.

"Graduating magna cum laude, captain of varsity hockey, attending MIT."

The hockey team erupted in cheers. Jordan Chen actually whistled.

Principal Harrison shook Ethan's hand, held it a moment longer than others. Leaned in and said something I couldn't hear from my seat. Something that made Ethan's expression shift—surprised, moved.

Ethan nodded, smiled genuinely, accepted his diploma.

In that moment, watching him stand on that stage in front of everyone—free from Robert's control, holding proof of his accomplishments, heading to MIT on his own terms—I felt overwhelming pride.

He'd done it. Against every pressure, every expectation, every manipulation. He'd chosen himself.

And Robert wasn't here to see it.

That empty seat in the stands suddenly felt different. Not just an absence, but a statement. Robert had chosen to miss this. Had chosen pride and ego over witnessing his son's achievement. Ethan was standing on that stage, having made the hardest choice of his life, and his father wasn't there.

The relief and grief of that tangled in my chest. Relief because Robert's presence would have poisoned this moment. Grief because Ethan deserved a father who could be proud of him.

But Caroline was standing, applauding, tears streaming down her face. Making up for Robert's absence with the love of two parents. That would have to be enough.

The ceremony continued. N's, O's, P's, Q's, R's, S's. All the way through to Z.

"Zoe Zimmerman." The last graduate. The end of alphabetical destiny.

Principal Harrison returned to the podium one final time.

"Before I invite you to turn your tassels and officially become graduates, I want to say one more thing." He looked across the sea of blue robes. "This class has been extraordinary. You've faced challenges that previous classes haven't. You've shown resilience, creativity, and determination. You've made me proud to be your principal."

Several teachers were crying now.

"So, Class of 2025—by the power vested in me by the State of Manitoba and the school board, I hereby declare you graduates of Eastwood High School. You may move your tassels from right to left."

Two hundred forty-seven hands moved simultaneously. Two hundred forty-seven tassels shifted position.

We were graduates.

"Congratulations, Class of 2025!"

Caps flew into the air. Cheering erupted. Students hugged, cried, laughed, celebrated.

I threw my cap up—watched it arc against the perfect blue sky, then fall back into the chaos of identical caps landing everywhere.

Someone grabbed me in a hug. Alicia Lopez, crying happy tears. "WE DID IT!"

"We did it," I agreed.

More hugs. Classmates I'd never spoken to, people I'd shared classes with, strangers who'd been part of my high school experience in invisible ways.

Marcus Lamar: "Good luck at MIT! Email me if you're ever in Toronto!"

Maya Chen: "That speech made me cry. Thank you."

Amy Rodriguez: "You and Ethan are going to be amazing at MIT. I'm jealous."

Then Ethan appeared through the crowd, still wearing his cap because he'd been smart enough not to throw it.

"You were incredible," he said. Voice rough with emotion. "That speech—"

"You're wearing your cap."

"I have good priorities." He pulled me into a hug that lifted me off the ground. "You talked about me. In your valedictorian speech. In front of everyone."

"I talked about choosing yourself. You happen to be a good example."

"I'm never forgetting that speech. Every word." He set me down but kept his hands on my shoulders. "When you said courage is making honest choices—I felt like you gave me permission to be okay with my decision. Like you told everyone it was valid."

"It is valid. You chose MIT. You chose yourself. That's the bravest thing I've ever seen."

"I couldn't have done it without you."

"Yeah, you could have. But I'm glad you didn't have to."

"Me too." His eyes were still wet. "Now let's find our parents before they send search parties."

The field had devolved into complete chaos. Families flooding down from the stands, graduates trying to find their people, teachers attempting to organize group photos, caps and robes everywhere.

We fought through the crowd together. Found my parents near the south end zone with Caroline.

Mom was still crying—happy tears now, proud tears.

"My baby graduated," she said, pulling me into a fierce hug.

"Technically I graduated eight minutes ago. You've had time to process."

"I'll never have enough time to process." She pulled back, looked at me seriously. "That speech was extraordinary. You've grown into someone remarkable."

Dad hugged me next. "Proud of you, kid. MIT's lucky to have you."

"I'm lucky to have MIT."

"Both can be true."

Caroline pulled Ethan into a hug that lasted longer than usual. "You were wonderful up there. Walking across that stage—I was so proud I thought my heart would burst."

"Thanks, Mom."

"Your father—" She stopped. Took a breath. "His absence is his loss. His choice. Not yours."

Ethan nodded. Swallowed hard. "I know."

But I could see it in his face—the complicated tangle of emotions. Relief that Robert wasn't here to make this moment about him. Grief that his father had chosen not to come. Anger and sadness and freedom all mixed together in a way that would take months to fully process.

My mother, sensing the weight of that moment, pulled Caroline into a hug. "Your son is extraordinary. You raised him well."

Caroline wiped her eyes. "Thank you. So is your daughter."

The four of us—five, when my parents included Ethan in the next round of photos—stood in a small circle of people who'd survived impossible circumstances together.

"Group photo?" Dad suggested.

We arranged ourselves: me and Ethan in the middle, parents on either side, all of us in various states of happy crying.

Dad handed his camera to a passing teacher. "Could you—"

"Absolutely." The teacher—Mrs. Chen, who'd taught both of us biology—took several photos. "You two have been through quite a year."

"Understatement," Ethan said.

"Well, you made it. Congratulations to both of you." She handed the camera back. "See you at MIT, maybe? I have a son starting there this fall too."

"Jordan's going to MIT?" I asked, surprised.

"Twin brother actually—Jordan's going to UBC for computer science. But my other son Daniel is MIT-bound."

Small world getting smaller. We'd see familiar faces at MIT, build new connections, create new communities.

Around us, similar scenes played out. Families celebrating, graduates posing for photos, friends making promises to stay in touch that some would keep and most wouldn't.

Jordan found us. "MERCER! LIU! We're getting group photos by the goal post! Come on!"

We followed him to where the hockey team had gathered—players in their blue robes, families taking pictures, everyone laughing and emotional.

"Okay, one serious photo," Jordan's mom directed. "Everyone together."

Twenty hockey players crammed together, arms around shoulders, genuine smiles.

"Now silly!"

Chaos. Someone lifted their robe. Someone else made a face. Jordan climbed onto two teammates' shoulders and almost fell.

"Perfect," Mrs. Chen said, laughing. "That's the real memory."

After team photos, after family photos, after what felt like eight hundred different picture combinations, the crowd started thinning.

"There's a grad party at Spencer's tonight," Jordan told us. "You guys coming?"

Ethan and I exchanged glances. "We have family dinner," I said.

"But maybe after?" Ethan added.

"Cool. Text me if you do. Open invitation all night."

The afternoon blurred into more congratulations, more photos, more goodbyes. Classmates scattering to their own family celebrations, teachers packing up, the football field slowly emptying.

At 2 PM, as the crowd thinned, Ethan caught my hand. "Can we just... walk for a minute? Before the family stuff starts?"

"Yeah. Let me tell my parents."

I found them packing up chairs and leftover programs. "We're going to walk around campus for a bit. Is that okay?"

Mom smiled. "Take your time. Dinner reservations aren't until six."

"We'll meet you at the restaurant," Dad added.

Caroline waved us off. "Go. Enjoy your last moments as high school students."

We walked away from the football field, still in our blue robes, caps in hand. The school looked different in the early afternoon light—more significant somehow, weighted with meaning.

"We actually graduated," Ethan said as we reached the front entrance.

"I know. It doesn't feel real."

"I keep thinking someone's going to tell us there was a mistake. We have to do senior year again."

"Please no." I laughed. "Once was enough."

We walked through the empty hallways. Past lockers we'd used every day, classrooms where we'd learned and slept and stressed, bulletin boards with graduation announcements already looking dated.

"This is so weird," I said. "Yesterday we were students here. Today we're just... people who used to be students."

"Tomorrow we're just people."

"Adults, supposedly."

"I don't feel like an adult."

"Me neither. I feel like a kid in a costume pretending to be grown up."

We ended up at the back entrance—the one that led to the courtyard where we'd had lunch so many times. Sat on the same bench where we'd had important conversations throughout the year.

Ethan pulled off his robe, the polyester crackling. "I'm so glad that's over."

"The ceremony or high school?"

"Both." He grinned. "Though the ceremony was nice. Your speech was perfect."

"I almost threw up before going up there."

"You couldn't tell. You looked confident."

"I was faking it really hard." I pulled off my own robe, relieved to be free of it. "Did you hear what Principal Harrison said to you? When you got your diploma?"

Ethan's expression softened. "He said, 'You made the right choice. I'm proud of you.'"

"Oh."

"Yeah." Ethan's voice went rough. "Needed to hear that from someone who's not you or my mom."

"He meant it. Everyone could see it."

We sat in silence for a moment. The weight of the day settling over us—the relief, the accomplishment, the bittersweetness of endings.

"Your dad," I said carefully. "Are you okay?"

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know. Part of me kept looking for him. Kept thinking maybe he'd surprise me and show up. Which is stupid because he told Mom he wouldn't come. Made it clear he wasn't interested in witnessing me 'throw my life away.'"

The bitterness in those last words made my chest ache.

"But also," Ethan continued, "I'm relieved he wasn't there. If he'd been in those stands, I would've spent the whole ceremony tense. Waiting for him to do something, say something, make it about him."

"You're allowed to feel both things."

"Relief and grief at the same time?"

"Yeah. He's your dad. Even when he's terrible at it, you're allowed to wish he could be better."

Ethan leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "That empty seat felt like... like physical proof that he chose not to love me the way I needed. That he'd rather lose me than accept my choice."

"That's his failure. Not yours."

"I know. Logically, I know. But it still hurts."

I put my hand on his back. Felt the tension there, the complicated grief he was processing.

"I'm proud of you," I said. "For everything. For choosing MIT, for standing on that stage, for graduating despite everything he tried to take from you. You did this."

Ethan turned to look at me. Eyes red but clear. "We did this. You were part of every decision. Every hard moment. I couldn't have survived this year without you."

"You're stronger than you think."

"Maybe. But I'm also smarter with you." He smiled slightly. "We survived senior year."

"We did."

"We graduated."

"We did."

"We're going to MIT in seven weeks."

"We are."

"Holy shit."

"Yeah."

We sat there in the empty courtyard, the afternoon sun warm on our faces, the school quiet around us. Two teenagers who'd become something more than friends, something more than survivors. Partners in the truest sense.

"What now?" Ethan asked.

"Now we go to family dinner. Be celebrated by people who love us. Eat too much food and take too many photos."

"And after that?"

"Summer. Real summer. No school, no crisis, no impossible decisions." I leaned against him. "Just us figuring out what normal looks like."

"I don't think we've ever been normal."

"Then we'll figure out what our version of normal looks like."

He kissed the top of my head. "That sounds perfect."

At 5:30, we finally left campus. Drove to our respective houses to change out of our graduation clothes into dinner attire. Made plans to meet at the restaurant.

The dinner was at Riverstone, the nicest restaurant in Winnipeg that wasn't actively pretentious. Caroline had made reservations weeks ago—a private corner booth that could fit five people.

I arrived first with my parents. Ordered water, studied the menu, tried not to fidget.

Caroline and Ethan arrived ten minutes later. Caroline looked beautiful in a simple navy dress. Ethan had changed into slacks and a button-down—the most formal I'd seen him outside of prom.

"Sorry we're late," Caroline said, sliding into the booth. "Parking was impossible."

"We just got here," Mom assured her.

The waiter came. We ordered—fancy entrees that cost more than casual meals but felt appropriate for the occasion. Graduation deserved celebration.

"To our graduates," Dad said, raising his water glass. "We're incredibly proud."

We clinked glasses. Sipped. Smiled.

The food came. It was delicious—perfectly cooked steaks, roasted vegetables that actually tasted good, desserts that were works of art.

The conversation flowed easily at first. Reliving ceremony highlights, discussing college prep, making jokes about how young we looked in our baby photos compared to now.

"When Sophia gave her speech," my mother said, "I could hear people crying around me. She moved the whole audience."

"The part about honest choices," Caroline added. "That resonated with everyone. Including me."

Mom looked at Caroline with interest. "Your divorce?"

I froze. We hadn't talked about this openly—the adults had all been carefully polite about Caroline's separation.

But Caroline nodded. "Filing was the hardest thing I've done in twenty years. But also the most honest. I'd been choosing safety over truth for so long, I'd forgotten what it felt like to choose myself."

"That takes courage," Dad said quietly.

"Or desperation." Caroline's laugh was slightly bitter. "The line between the two is thinner than I'd like."

An uncomfortable beat. Ethan shifted beside me.

"How are you managing?" Mom asked. "Financially, emotionally?"

"Financially, better than expected. I have a good job, separate accounts, lawyer who's competent." Caroline paused. "Emotionally... it's complicated. Relief mostly. But also grief. I'm mourning a man who never actually existed—the version I thought I married."

Mom reached across the table and squeezed Caroline's hand. "That's one of the hardest things to lose. The person you thought someone was."

They held eye contact for a moment—two women who'd survived complicated marriages in different ways, finding common ground.

The conversation shifted back to safer topics. MIT preparation, summer plans, what we needed to buy for dorm rooms.

But the earlier tension lingered. I could feel it in the way Caroline kept blinking too much, fighting tears. In the way Ethan's jaw was tight.

Dessert came—chocolate cake that was too rich, crème brûlée that was perfectly crispy on top.

"Are you ready for MIT?" Dad asked Ethan directly. "Academically, I mean?"

"I think so," Ethan said. "I'm more worried about whether I'm smart enough compared to everyone else."

"Imposter syndrome," Caroline said. "Ethan's convinced everyone at MIT will be brilliant except him."

"I know that feeling," I admitted. "I keep thinking there was a mistake. That they'll realize I'm not actually that smart and revoke my acceptance."

"Both of you are being ridiculous," Mom said. "MIT doesn't make mistakes. You both earned your places there."

"Logically, I know that," Ethan said. "But there's this voice in my head that sounds like—" He stopped. Took a breath. "That sounds like doubt."

Like Robert. He'd almost said it sounded like Robert.

Another uncomfortable silence.

Caroline's phone buzzed. She glanced at it, then put it away quickly. But not before I saw her expression tighten.

"Everything okay?" Mom asked.

"Fine. Just... Robert's lawyer wants to schedule mediation." Caroline's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Apparently he's contesting some of the separation terms."

"Of course he is," Ethan muttered.

"We don't have to talk about this now," Caroline said. "This is your celebration dinner."

But the damage was done. Robert's presence—his absence earlier, his legal maneuvering now—had poisoned the edges of our celebration.

The check came. Dad insisted on paying despite Caroline's protests.

"You bought Sophia's prom dress," he said. "Let us buy dinner."

We filed out of the restaurant at 8 PM. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the parking lot.

"That was lovely," Mom said, hugging Caroline. "Let's do this again before the kids leave for Boston."

"I'd like that."

My parents hugged me, then Ethan. Told us they were proud again. Reminded us to be home at a reasonable hour.

Then they left, and it was just me, Ethan, and Caroline standing in the parking lot.

"Are you two going to the grad party?" Caroline asked.

"Maybe," Ethan said. "We're not sure yet."

"Go. Have fun. Be teenagers." She hugged Ethan tightly. "You did so well today. I'm so proud of you."

"Thanks, Mom."

"I mean it. Walking across that stage, everything you've accomplished—you should be proud of yourself."

Ethan nodded. Didn't quite meet her eyes.

Caroline left. Ethan and I stood alone in the now-empty parking lot, the weight of the day finally catching up.

"Do you want to go to the party?" I asked.

"Not really."

"Me neither."

"Want to just... drive?"

"Yeah."

We got in his car. Drove with no destination, windows down, music playing softly. Past our school, past the park where we'd had so many conversations, past the rink where everything had started to change.

"Graduation was supposed to feel like an ending," Ethan said after a long silence. "Like we closed a chapter and everything's resolved."

"But it doesn't."

"No. It feels like... like we survived something but the survival is fragile. Like one wrong move and everything could still fall apart."

I understood completely. The perfect day—graduation, the speeches, the celebration—had been beautiful. But underneath it all was the reality we couldn't escape. Robert's absence, Caroline's divorce stress, our own fears about whether we were ready for what came next.

"We graduated," I said. "That's real. We both got into MIT. We survived Robert's manipulation and the NHL offers and everything that tried to break us. That's all real too."

"I know."

"But you're scared."

"Terrified." He glanced at me. "Are you?"

"Yeah. MIT, leaving badminton, starting over—it all feels huge and fragile at the same time."

"What if we can't handle it?"

"Then we figure it out. Together."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

We ended up at The Forks—the marketplace downtown where the rivers meet. Tourist destination and local hangout, always busy, always alive with people.

We got coffee and found a bench overlooking the river. The sky was darkening, stars beginning to appear.

"Today was supposed to be perfect," Ethan said quietly.

"It was pretty close."

"Except for my father not being there. And my mom getting texts from lawyers during dinner. And both of us admitting we're terrified of MIT."

"Okay, so not completely perfect." I leaned against him. "But we graduated. We gave good speeches. We have families who love us. That's more than a lot of people have."

"True."

"And we have each other."

"Also true." He wrapped his arm around me. "That's the only part that feels solid right now. Everything else is uncertain, but you—us—that's the one thing I'm sure about."

"Me too."

We sat in silence, watching Winnipeg move around us. Families with young children, couples on dates, tourists taking photos, people just living their lives.

Normal people having normal days.

We weren't normal. We'd never been normal. But we were learning how to build something that worked for us—something honest and messy and real.

"Summer starts tomorrow," I said.

"Finally."

"Three weeks until my Toronto training."

"Don't remind me. I'm already dreading it."

"It's only three weeks."

"Three weeks without you feels like forever."

"Dramatic."

"Accurate."

I smiled. Kissed his cheek. "We'll survive it. We've survived worse."

"Barely."

"But we did."

We stayed at The Forks until the coffee was cold and the stars were bright. Talked about nothing important—summer plans, what to pack for MIT, whether we needed winter coats in Boston (yes, definitely yes).

At 10 PM, Ethan's phone buzzed. Caroline: *Home safe. Hope you two are having fun. Don't stay out too late.*

"We should probably head back," Ethan said.

"Yeah."

We drove to my house. Parked in the driveway. The porch light was on—my parents leaving it on as invitation to come home when we were ready.

On the porch, in the warm June evening, Ethan pulled me close.

"We graduated," he said.

"We did."

"We're going to MIT in seven weeks."

"We are."

"We survived everything."

"So far."

He laughed. "Always the optimist."

"Always the realist." I leaned against him, tired from the long day but happy. Grateful. Aware that we'd made it through something significant. "What's next?"

"Summer. Normal summer. Working, hanging out, being teenagers who don't have school or crisis or impossible decisions."

"That sounds amazing."

"Doesn't it?" He kissed the top of my head. "Three weeks until your training program. Want to make them count?"

"Every single day."

We stood there as the sky darkened and stars appeared, holding onto the moment before everything changed again.

Tomorrow, summer would begin.

In three weeks, I'd leave for Toronto.

In seven weeks, we'd both leave for MIT.

But tonight, we were just graduates. Just us. Just beginning.

Scared and hopeful and together.

And that was exactly enough.
