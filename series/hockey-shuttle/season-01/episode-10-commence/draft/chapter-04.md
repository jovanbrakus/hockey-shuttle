# Chapter 4: Graduation Day

June 28th dawned clear and bright—the kind of perfect Manitoba summer day that felt like a gift.

I woke at 7 AM to my mother already bustling around the house, emotional before the ceremony had even started.

"It's just graduation," I said from the kitchen doorway. "I'll still be here all summer."

"It's not just graduation. It's the end of childhood." She wiped her eyes. "Tomorrow you're an adult. Today you're still my baby."

"Mom."

"Let me be emotional. I've earned it."

Dad appeared with coffee and a knowing smile. "She's been crying since 6 AM. Just let it happen."

At 8:30, I put on my cap and gown. Royal blue polyester that made everyone look the same—which was perhaps the point. 247 graduating seniors, all wearing identical robes, all moving into uncertain futures.

The cap wouldn't sit right on my head. I'd spent an hour last night figuring out how to pin it so my hair wouldn't destroy it, but it still felt precarious.

My phone buzzed. Ethan: *This cap is ridiculous. How does anyone keep these on their head?*

I responded: *Bobby pins. Many bobby pins.*

*I don't have bobby pins.*

*Then prepare for your cap to fall off during the ceremony.*

*Great. I'll look stupid in all the photos.*

*You'll look fine. See you there.*

The ceremony was at 11 AM, held on the football field because we were too many graduates to fit in the gymnasium. Families were already gathering in the stands when I arrived at 10:15—parents, grandparents, siblings, everyone dressed up and carrying flowers and cameras.

The staging area behind the bleachers was controlled chaos. Two hundred forty-seven seniors trying to line up alphabetically while teachers barked instructions and everyone adjusted caps and took selfies.

I found my place in line—"L" section, between Lamar and Lopez. Ethan was somewhere in the "M"s, probably fifteen people behind me.

I turned to look for him and caught his eye across the crowd. He was already in his robe, cap sitting crooked on his head just like I'd predicted. He gave me a small wave and a crooked smile.

Jordan Chen, standing near Ethan, shouted across the staging area: "LAST TIME WE'RE ALL TOGETHER, PEOPLE!"

Someone else yelled back: "DON'T MAKE IT WEIRD, CHEN!"

But it was weird. This was the last time we'd all be in the same place. By September, we'd be scattered across the country—different colleges, different jobs, different lives. Some of us would stay in touch. Most wouldn't. That's how high school worked.

Principal Harrison appeared with a megaphone. "SENIORS! LISTEN UP!"

The chaos quieted slightly.

"In fifteen minutes, we begin the processional. When I call your row, you walk in pairs down the center aisle. Don't run, don't trip, don't do anything stupid that ends up on social media." He looked directly at Jordan. "I'm talking to you, Chen."

"I would never, sir!"

"You absolutely would. Don't."

At 10:45, music started. Pomp and Circumstance, the classic graduation march. Cliché and perfect.

"ROW ONE, GO!"

The first students began walking. Slowly, methodically, we moved forward.

I walked with Alicia Lopez, a girl I'd had exactly three conversations with in four years. We smiled at each other nervously, two strangers sharing a significant moment.

The football field opened up before us—rows of white chairs, stands packed with families, teachers in their academic regalia sitting on the stage, Principal Harrison at the podium.

I found my parents in the crowd immediately. Mom was already crying. Dad had his camera ready.

Next to them: Caroline. She'd come alone—Robert's seat conspicuously empty. She waved when she caught my eye, beaming with pride.

I took my seat in the third row, "L" section. Ethan would be a few rows back. I couldn't turn around without being obvious, so I sat straight and waited.

The processional took twenty minutes. Two hundred forty-seven students filing in, finding seats, settling. When the last senior sat down, Principal Harrison approached the microphone.

"Welcome, families and friends, to the graduation ceremony for Eastwood High School, Class of 2025."

The crowd applauded.

"Today we celebrate 247 exceptional young people who have earned the right to stand here. They've completed four years of rigorous academics, demonstrated excellence in activities and athletics, and proven themselves ready for whatever comes next."

He continued with the standard graduation speech—overcoming challenges, bright futures, endless possibilities. I'd heard versions of this speech dozens of times. But today, sitting in my blue robe with my bobby-pinned cap, it felt different.

This was actually happening. We were actually graduating.

"Before we begin conferring diplomas," Principal Harrison said, "we have several students speaking today. First, our valedictorian, Sophia Liu."

My stomach dropped.

I'd known this was coming—had been preparing the speech for weeks. But suddenly, walking to that podium in front of 800 people seemed impossible.

I stood. My legs worked. I walked to the stage, climbed the steps, took my place behind the microphone.

Deep breath. Look at the audience. Find friendly faces.

Mom: crying. Dad: proud. Caroline: encouraging. Ethan: (I found him in the M section) completely focused on me, like I was the only person in the world.

I pulled out my note cards—backup in case my brain stopped working. But I'd memorized every word.

"Good morning, graduates, families, teachers, and distinguished guests."

My voice echoed across the field. Surprisingly steady.

"When Principal Harrison asked me to be valedictorian speaker, I almost said no."

Scattered laughter from the audience.

"Not because I don't have things to say—anyone who knows me knows I always have things to say—but because I've only been at this school for nine months. Nine months. Most of you have known each other since kindergarten."

I made eye contact with classmates in the front rows.

"But then I realized: maybe that's exactly why I should speak. Because I've seen this place with fresh eyes. And what I've seen is extraordinary.

"I moved to Winnipeg in September from a smaller town where I was the badminton girl. Here, I became the new girl, the scholarship student, the one who didn't know anyone. I expected to be lonely. Instead, I found something I didn't know I was looking for.

"I found a community that celebrates excellence in all its forms. Athletes and artists, scientists and musicians, writers and builders. I found teachers who genuinely care whether we understand, not just whether we pass. I found classmates who pushed me to be better, even when I didn't think I could be."

I paused. Looked directly at Ethan.

"But most importantly, I learned something about choosing yourself.

"This year, many of us faced impossible choices. College or career. Safety or dreams. What others expect versus what we actually want. And here's what I learned: the only wrong choice is the one you make for someone else."

Several parents were nodding. Several students were listening more intently.

"Some of us are going to Ivy League schools. Some are joining the military. Some are starting businesses, taking gap years, going to community college, starting families, or pursuing professional sports. Every single path is valid if it's genuinely yours."

I glanced at my note cards. Didn't need them.

"I'm going to MIT in August—and yes, I'm terrified. I'm leaving behind a sport I love, a city I've grown to care about, and all the safety of what I know. But I'm choosing it. Not because it's what my parents want, though they're supportive. Not because it looks good on paper. But because when I imagine my future, this is the one that makes me excited instead of just secure."

More nodding. Caroline was outright crying now.

"And I learned this from watching all of you. The artist who chose Parsons over pre-med. The hockey player who chose education over professional contracts."

I didn't look at Ethan. Didn't need to. Everyone knew who I meant.

"The musician who chose Berklee over business school. The writer who chose to take a year to write instead of rushing to college. You taught me that courage isn't about making the biggest choice or the most impressive choice. It's about making the honest choice.

"So here's my challenge for all of us: In five years, ten years, twenty years—when we're living whatever lives we've built—I hope we can look back and say 'I chose this. Not my parents, not my teachers, not society's expectations. Me.'

"Because that's what graduation really means. Not that we've finished something, but that we're finally free to begin."

I gripped the podium, feeling the weight of 247 pairs of eyes.

"To the Class of 2025: We made it. Not just through classes and exams and social drama, but through a year that tested us in ways we didn't expect. We're stronger than we knew. Braver than we believed. And ready for whatever comes next.

"Thank you, and congratulations."

I stepped back from the microphone.

For one heartbeat, silence.

Then applause. Sustained, loud, genuine applause.

I made it back to my seat somehow, shaking slightly from adrenaline. Alicia Lopez whispered, "That was amazing."

I couldn't speak. Just nodded.

From several rows back, I felt Ethan's gaze. Proud. Moved. Connected across the space.

Principal Harrison returned to the podium. "Thank you, Ms. Liu, for those inspiring words. Now, we'll begin conferring diplomas. When you hear your name, please come to the stage."

The next hour was a blur of names.

"Andrew Abbott." Applause. Walk across stage. Shake hands. Receive diploma. Pose for photo. Return to seat.

"Jennifer Adams." Repeat.

"Marcus Anderson." Repeat.

The alphabet progressed. I waited through the B's, C's, D's, E's, F's, G's, H's, I's, J's, K's.

Then: "Sophia Marie Liu."

I stood. Walked to the stage for the second time.

Principal Harrison shook my hand. "Graduating summa cum laude, national badminton champion, attending MIT."

The crowd applauded—louder for me because of the valedictorian speech. I accepted my diploma, posed for the official photo, scanned the crowd.

Mom and Dad: on their feet, applauding. Caroline: also standing, beaming.

I returned to my seat, diploma in hand. Official proof that I'd completed high school. Official permission to move forward.

The M's came quickly.

"Ethan James Mercer."

My heart jumped.

Ethan walked to the stage with athletic grace, even in the ridiculous blue robe. His cap had stayed on—miraculous.

"Graduating magna cum laude, captain of varsity hockey, attending MIT."

The hockey team erupted in cheers. Jordan Chen actually whistled.

Principal Harrison shook Ethan's hand, held it a moment longer than others. Leaned in and said something I couldn't hear from my seat.

Ethan nodded, smiled genuinely, accepted his diploma.

In that moment, watching him stand on that stage in front of everyone—free from Robert's control, holding proof of his accomplishments, heading to MIT on his own terms—I felt overwhelming pride.

He'd done it. We'd both done it.

The ceremony continued. N's, O's, P's, Q's, R's, S's. All the way through to Z.

"Zoe Zimmerman." The last graduate. The end of alphabetical destiny.

Principal Harrison returned to the podium one final time.

"Before I invite you to turn your tassels and officially become graduates, I want to say one more thing." He looked across the sea of blue robes. "This class has been extraordinary. You've faced challenges that previous classes haven't. You've shown resilience, creativity, and determination. You've made me proud to be your principal."

Several teachers were crying now.

"So, Class of 2025—by the power vested in me by the State of Manitoba and the school board, I hereby declare you graduates of Eastwood High School. You may move your tassels from right to left."

Two hundred forty-seven hands moved simultaneously. Two hundred forty-seven tassels shifted position.

We were graduates.

"Congratulations, Class of 2025!"

Caps flew into the air. Cheering erupted. Students hugged, cried, laughed, celebrated.

I threw my cap up—watched it arc against the perfect blue sky, then fall back into the chaos of identical caps landing everywhere.

Someone grabbed me in a hug. Alicia Lopez, crying happy tears. "WE DID IT!"

"We did it," I agreed.

More hugs. Classmates I'd never spoken to, people I'd shared classes with, strangers who'd been part of my high school experience in invisible ways.

Then Ethan appeared through the crowd, still wearing his cap because he'd been smart enough not to throw it.

"You were incredible," he said. "That speech—"

"You're wearing your cap."

"I have good priorities." He pulled me into a hug that lifted me off the ground. "You talked about me. In your valedictorian speech. In front of everyone."

"I talked about choosing yourself. You happen to be a good example."

"I'm never forgetting that speech. Every word."

"It was just graduation speech."

"It was everything." He set me down, kept his hands on my shoulders. "You told 800 people that courage is making honest choices. That we're allowed to choose ourselves. That—"

"That you chose MIT over the NHL and it was brave, not stupid?"

"Yeah. That." His eyes were wet. "Thank you."

"You're welcome. Now let's find our parents before they send search parties."

The field had devolved into complete chaos. Families flooding down from the stands, graduates trying to find their people, teachers attempting to organize group photos, caps and robes everywhere.

I found my parents near the south end zone. Mom was still crying—happy tears now, proud tears.

"My baby graduated," she said, pulling me into a fierce hug.

"Technically I graduated eight minutes ago. You've had time to process."

"I'll never have enough time to process." She pulled back, looked at me seriously. "That speech was extraordinary. You've grown into someone remarkable."

Dad hugged me next. "Proud of you, kid. MIT's lucky to have you."

"I'm lucky to have MIT."

"Both can be true."

Caroline appeared with Ethan. The four of us—five when my parents pulled Caroline into the group—stood in a small circle of people who'd survived impossible circumstances together.

"Group photo?" Dad suggested.

We arranged ourselves: me and Ethan in the middle, parents on either side, all of us in various states of happy crying.

Dad handed his camera to a passing teacher. "Could you—"

"Absolutely." The teacher—Mrs. Chen, who'd taught both of us biology—took several photos. "You two have been through quite a year."

"Understatement," Ethan said.

"Well, you made it. Congratulations to both of you." She handed the camera back. "See you at MIT, maybe? I have a daughter starting there this fall too."

"Jordan's sister?" I asked.

"Twin brother, actually. He's going to UBC for computer science."

Small world getting smaller. We'd see familiar faces at MIT, build new connections, create new communities.

The afternoon blurred into celebration. Lunch with both sets of parents at a nice restaurant downtown. Awkward conversation between adults who'd been brought together by their children's relationship, but who were genuinely starting to like each other.

Caroline and my mother discovered shared interests—architecture and design, creating homes that felt intentional. Dad and Caroline talked about her new job, about starting over professionally in your forties.

Ethan and I just ate and observed, our own little island of graduated teenagers in a sea of proud parents.

At 3 PM, we escaped.

"Want to drive around?" Ethan asked. "No destination. Just... exist?"

"Perfect."

We drove through Winnipeg with the windows down and music playing. Past the school we'd just graduated from. Past the park where we'd had so many important conversations. Past the rink where he'd taught me to skate and I'd taught him that excellence could be fun.

"Everything looks different," Ethan said.

"Everything is different. We're graduated. We're done."

"We're free."

We ended up at The Forks—the marketplace downtown where the rivers meet. Tourist destination and local hangout, always busy, always alive with people.

We got coffee and found a bench overlooking the river.

"Your speech," Ethan said after a long silence. "The part about choosing yourself. Did you plan that?"

"Every word. Wrote seventeen drafts."

"It sounded spontaneous."

"Good delivery. Lots of practice." I sipped my coffee. "Did it bother you? That I basically told everyone about your choice?"

"No. It made me proud." He leaned back, watched boats on the river. "You took my personal crisis and made it universal. Made it about everyone's right to choose honestly."

"That's what it was about. For both of us."

"Yeah." He was quiet for a moment. "My father wasn't there."

"I noticed."

"Part of me hoped he'd come. Show up. Make some grand gesture." Ethan laughed without humor. "Stupid, right? After everything?"

"Not stupid. Human. He's still your dad, even if he's terrible at it."

"Caroline filed for full legal separation last week. The divorce will be final in six months." He traced the rim of his coffee cup. "She's done. Completely done. And I am too, logically. But emotionally..."

"You're allowed to grieve him. Even while being glad he's gone."

"Is that normal?"

"I think so. Feelings don't have to make sense."

We sat in silence, watching Winnipeg move around us. Families with young children, couples on dates, tourists taking photos, people just living their lives.

"What time is your parents' thing tonight?" Ethan asked.

They'd planned a graduation dinner—just family, intimate, celebratory. Caroline was invited. Robert was not.

"Six o'clock. You're still coming, right?"

"Wouldn't miss it." He checked his phone. "That gives us two more hours of freedom before we have to be responsible adults at a fancy dinner."

"What should we do with two hours of freedom?"

"Absolutely nothing productive."

So we walked. Through The Forks marketplace, past vendors selling art and food and handmade goods. Along the river walk, where cyclists passed and runners trained and the city felt both enormous and intimate.

We talked about nothing important. Summer plans, what to pack for MIT, whether we needed winter coats in Boston (yes, definitely yes). Normal conversation for normal teenagers on a normal June afternoon.

Except we weren't normal teenagers. We'd never been normal. But we were getting better at pretending.

At 5:30, we drove to the restaurant where my parents had reserved a private room. Fancy enough to feel special, casual enough to feel comfortable.

Caroline arrived first, dressed in a simple sundress, carrying flowers for my mother.

"To celebrate both our graduates," she said, handing them over.

My mother accepted them with genuine warmth. "Our kids are pretty incredible."

"They really are."

Dinner was perfect—good food, easy conversation, laughter that felt earned. We toasted with sparkling cider, took photos, told stories about the ceremony.

"When Sophia gave her speech," my mother said, "I could hear people crying around me. She moved the whole audience."

"The part about honest choices," Caroline added. "That resonated with everyone."

"It resonated with me," Dad said. "Made me think about my own choices. Whether I'm living honestly or just living safely."

Ethan and I exchanged glances. My valedictorian speech was apparently having effects I hadn't anticipated.

At 8 PM, as dinner wound down and parents started yawning, my mother pulled out a gift bag.

"For both of you," she said, handing it across the table.

Ethan and I opened it together. Inside: matching MIT sweatshirts (adult sizes, properly fitted) and a framed photo from prom night—the one Dad had taken when we didn't know, Ethan adjusting my hair while I laughed.

"For your dorm rooms," Mom explained. "So you remember where you came from."

"And who you came with," Caroline added.

We thanked them, suddenly emotional for reasons that were hard to articulate. It wasn't about the gifts. It was about being seen, being celebrated, being supported by people who'd chosen to love us through complicated circumstances.

At 9 PM, we said goodbyes. Caroline headed home. My parents drove Ethan and me back to my house.

On the front porch, in the warm June evening, Ethan pulled me close.

"We graduated," he said.

"We did."

"We're going to MIT in seven weeks."

"We are."

"We survived everything."

"So far."

He laughed. "Always the optimist."

"Always the realist." I leaned against him, tired from the long day but happy. "What's next?"

"Summer. Normal summer. Working, hanging out, being teenagers who don't have school or crisis or impossible decisions."

"That sounds amazing."

"Doesn't it?" He kissed the top of my head. "Three weeks until your training program. Want to make them count?"

"Every single day."

We stood there as the sky darkened and stars appeared, holding onto the moment before everything changed again.

Tomorrow, summer would begin.

In three weeks, I'd leave for Toronto.

In seven weeks, we'd both leave for MIT.

But tonight, we were just graduates. Just us. Just beginning.

And that was exactly enough.
