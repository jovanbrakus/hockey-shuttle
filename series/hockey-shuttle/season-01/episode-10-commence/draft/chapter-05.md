# Chapter 5: Summer Love

The first week of summer felt like a gift we hadn't known we'd been waiting for.

No school. No crisis. No impossible decisions hanging over us. Just June in Winnipeg, warm and bright and completely normal.

Ethan started coaching at the youth hockey camp on July 2nd—teaching kids ages 6-10 basic skating and puck control. I showed up the first day to watch, curious about this version of him I'd never fully seen.

"Coach Ethan!" A tiny kid in oversized gear skated up to him, wobbling dramatically. "I can't stop!"

"That's because you're not using your edges." Ethan crouched down to the kid's level, demonstrated the proper technique. "See? Inside edge to stop. Outside edge to turn. Try it."

The kid tried. Failed. Tried again. Succeeded.

"I DID IT! COACH ETHAN, I DID IT!"

"You did! Now practice twenty more times."

I watched him work for an hour—patient, encouraging, completely different from the controlled, pressured version of Ethan that Robert had created. This Ethan loved hockey because it was fun. Because teaching small humans to skate was joyful. Because excellence could exist without pressure.

"You're good at this," I said afterward as he put away equipment.

"At hockey?"

"At teaching. At being patient. At making something you love accessible to kids who are just learning."

He smiled. "It's different when it's my choice. When I'm doing it because I want to, not because someone's forcing me."

"You look happy."

"I am happy." He locked the equipment shed, turned to face me fully. "For the first time in years, hockey is fun again. Just pure fun."

I started my own job that week—coaching badminton at the community center and tutoring math for summer school students. The badminton kids were enthusiastic but undisciplined, the math students were struggling but determined.

Ethan showed up one afternoon to watch me teach.

"Adjust your grip fifteen degrees clockwise," I told a twelve-year-old who couldn't get her serve right. "Your thumb should be here, not here."

"Why?"

"Because physics. The angle of contact determines the trajectory. If your angle is wrong, your trajectory will be wrong."

"You teach like an engineer," Ethan said after class.

"I am going to be an engineer."

"You know what I mean. Everything's systems and optimization. 'Adjust your grip angle fifteen degrees.'"

"That's how you improve. Precision and repetition."

"You're going to love MIT."

"We're both going to love MIT."

We fell into a rhythm—working during the day, meeting for lunch when schedules aligned, spending evenings together doing nothing in particular. Movies, walks, ice cream, the park. Normal teenage summer activities that felt extraordinary because we'd earned them.

On July 10th, we drove out to the lake with Jordan Chen and a group of Ethan's hockey friends. Someone's family had a cabin, and we'd been invited for a beach day.

I'd never done this before—the casual group hangout, the friends-of-boyfriend social scene. I was nervous.

"They're going to love you," Ethan assured me on the drive.

"They're your friends. They have to be nice to me."

"They're nice humans. They'll be nice because you're interesting and funny and excellent at everything."

Jordan's family cabin was right on the water—private beach, dock, perfect summer setup. By the time we arrived, there were already a dozen people there.

"MERCER!" Jordan shouted from the dock. "GET IN THE WATER!"

Ethan grinned. "Apparently we're swimming."

The afternoon dissolved into the kind of carefree chaos I'd only seen in movies. Swimming, volleyball, sunburn, laughter. Jordan's girlfriend—Amy, a theater major heading to Northwestern—immediately adopted me into the girls' group.

"You're the one from the valedictorian speech," she said. "The 'choosing yourself' thing. I loved that."

"Thanks. It was terrifying to deliver."

"Public speaking always is. But you nailed it." She passed me a volleyball. "Want to destroy the boys at beach volleyball?"

We did. Absolutely destroyed them. Amy and I on one team, two of Jordan's friends on the other. Ethan watched from the shore, grinning as I spiked the winning point.

"You're competitive," he said afterward.

"I'm a national badminton champion. Did you expect anything else?"

"Fair point."

As the sun set, someone built a fire on the beach. We roasted marshmallows and told stories and existed in that perfect teenage summer space where nothing mattered except the moment.

"What's MIT like?" Amy asked. "Jordan's twin is going there too. Computer science."

"We literally know nothing except that it's going to be hard," Ethan admitted.

"Rumor is the first semester is designed to break you," Jordan added. "Weed out the weak."

"Encouraging," I said.

"But you guys are smart. You'll be fine."

"Are we though?" Ethan asked. "Smart enough for MIT?"

"You got in, didn't you?"

"Lots of people get in. Not all of them survive."

Jordan threw a marshmallow at him. "Stop catastrophizing. You're going to be fine. Both of you."

Later, after the fire died down and people started drifting inside, Ethan and I walked along the beach.

"I'm going to miss this," he said.

"The lake?"

"Summer. Winnipeg. Normal." He picked up a smooth stone, skipped it across the water. "In seven weeks we'll be at MIT, and all of this will be memory."

"Good memory though."

"The best memory." He found my hand in the dark. "I've never had a normal summer before. Robert always had me in elite training camps or specialized programs. But this—hanging out with friends, working a job I chose, being with you—this is the summer I didn't know I was missing."

"We still have a month left."

"Minus your three weeks in Toronto."

Right. National training program. July 20th through August 10th. Twenty-one days apart.

"We'll survive three weeks," I said with more confidence than I felt.

"I know. But I'm going to miss you."

"Miss you too."

We stayed at the lake until midnight, then drove home under stars that seemed impossibly bright. Ethan sang along to the radio—off-key and enthusiastic—while I laughed and took mental snapshots of the moment.

This. This was what we'd been fighting for. Not just the right to be together, but the right to be normal teenagers having normal experiences.

On July 15th, we started packing for our respective adventures.

Ethan helped me organize what I'd need for Toronto—badminton gear, clothes, training equipment. The national program had sent a detailed packing list that was both helpful and overwhelming.

"Three pairs of court shoes?" Ethan read from the list. "Why do you need three pairs?"

"Because when you're training eight hours a day, shoes wear out fast."

"Eight hours a day for three weeks straight. That's intense."

"That's national level." I folded another training shirt into my bag. "You think MIT's going to be less intense?"

"Fair point."

He was packing too—for a week-long hockey coaching certification course that started July 22nd. Not elite training, just professional development. His choice, his timeline, his career path.

"What if Toronto changes you?" he asked suddenly.

I stopped packing. "What?"

"Three weeks with the best badminton players in the country. Elite coaching. National team environment." He sat on my bed, looking uncertain. "What if you come back and you're different? What if you realize you want to go pro, defer MIT, commit to badminton full-time?"

"Is that what you're actually worried about?"

"I don't know. Maybe?" He ran his hands through his hair. "I chose MIT over the NHL. But you're better at badminton than I ever was at hockey. You could go pro. You could be great."

I sat down next to him, took his hand. "Ethan. Look at me."

He did.

"I'm going to Toronto to train. To get better. To see what elite level looks like." I squeezed his hand. "I'm not going to decide my entire future in three weeks. Neither are you. We're going to MIT in August. Together. That's the plan."

"But what if—"

"What if I love it? What if I'm amazing? What if the national team wants me?" I interrupted. "Then I'll have choices to make. But those are future choices, not right now choices."

"You're not going to defer MIT."

"I'm not going to defer MIT. I'm going to train for three weeks, learn everything I can, then come home and pack for Boston." I leaned against him. "Besides, you're the one who made me go. Remember? 'You have to do this, Sophie. Don't give up opportunities because of us.'"

He laughed. "I did say that."

"You did. So don't panic now."

"I'm not panicking."

"You're definitely panicking."

"Okay, I'm a little bit panicking." He wrapped an arm around me. "I just got you. I don't want to lose you."

"You're not going to lose me in three weeks."

"Promise?"

"Promise. Now help me pack before I forget something essential."

On July 19th—the night before I left for Toronto—both our families had dinner together at my house.

My parents, Caroline, Ethan, and me. The weird blended family we'd created through crisis and survival.

"To summer adventures," Dad toasted. "May they be challenging but not overwhelming."

"To growth," Caroline added. "And to coming home changed but not lost."

"To us," Ethan said, looking at me. "And to three weeks that will feel like forever but will pass anyway."

"To communication," I added. "Daily phone calls mandatory."

We ate and talked and laughed. Caroline told stories about her new job—she was apparently thriving, designing her first small project for the firm. My parents shared updates about their own work, their own lives beyond just being our support system.

"We're going to visit MIT in August," Mom announced. "Before you move in. Want to do a family tour?"

"Both families?" I asked.

"Both families," Caroline confirmed. "If that's okay with everyone?"

It was more than okay. It was perfect.

After dinner, Ethan and I escaped to the backyard while our parents cleaned up inside.

"Last night before you leave," he said.

"For three weeks. Not forever."

"I know. But still."

We sat on the porch steps, watching the July sky fade from blue to purple to dark.

"Are you nervous?" Ethan asked. "About Toronto?"

"Terrified. Everyone there will be better than me."

"You're a national champion."

"In the under-18 division. These are players who've been on national teams, who've competed internationally, who are legitimately elite." I picked at the paint on the porch railing. "I might be completely out of my depth."

"Or you might be exactly where you're supposed to be."

"How do you stay so confident?"

"I'm not confident. I'm just good at pretending." He bumped his shoulder against mine. "We're both going to be out of our depth a lot over the next few years. MIT, elite athletics, adult life. Might as well get used to it now."

"Encouraging."

"Honest."

We sat in silence as the first stars appeared.

"Call me when you land?" Ethan said.

"Obviously."

"And every day after?"

"Every single day. You're going to get sick of hearing from me."

"Impossible."

At 10 PM, Caroline came to collect him. They were heading to the airport early tomorrow—6 AM flight to Toronto for me, then she was driving Ethan to his coaching course.

"See you in three weeks," Ethan said at my front door.

"Three weeks. Twenty-one days. 504 hours."

"You calculated?"

"I'm going to MIT for engineering. Of course I calculated."

He kissed me goodnight—long and sweet and a little bit desperate. "I love you."

He'd never said it quite like that before. Direct, simple, true.

"Love you too."

"Be amazing in Toronto."

"Be amazing in coaching class."

"Miss me."

"Every day."

He left. I watched his car disappear down the street.

Tomorrow, summer would pause. We'd go our separate directions for the first time since getting together. Three weeks apart to grow individually before coming back together for MIT.

I was terrified.

I was excited.

Both were true, and both were valid.

**TORONTO: WEEK ONE**

The National Badminton Development Program was housed at a massive sports complex in downtown Toronto. Twenty athletes from across Canada, all between 16-18, all exceptional, all competing for limited spots on national teams.

I arrived at the residence hall on July 20th at 2 PM, dragging two suitcases of equipment and feeling completely out of place.

My roommate was already there—a girl named Priya from Vancouver, 17, ranked third in Canada in her age group.

"Sophia Liu!" She jumped up from her bed. "National champion! I watched your finals match online. That comeback in the third game was insane."

"You watched my match?"

"Everyone watches everyone here. We're all obsessed." She helped me with my bags. "Fair warning: this program is brutal. Like, actually brutal. Eight hours a day, six days a week. They're trying to break us."

"Encouraging."

"But also amazing. The coaching is incredible. If you survive, you'll be twice the player you are now."

The first training session was at 6 PM. All twenty athletes gathered in the main gymnasium, facing the head coach—a former Olympian named Coach Kim who had a reputation for being brilliant and unforgiving.

"Welcome," Coach Kim said without preamble. "You're here because you're good. But good isn't good enough for international competition. Over the next three weeks, we're going to make you great. Or we're going to break you trying. Some of you won't make it. That's fine. Better to discover your limits now than at the Olympics."

Encouraging start.

We trained until 9 PM. Footwork drills, serve practice, rally simulations, conditioning. I was good—had been the best player in Winnipeg by a significant margin. Here, I was middle of the pack. Maybe.

After training, I collapsed in my dorm room and called Ethan.

"How was day one?" he asked.

"I'm going to die."

"That good?"

"I'm average here. Maybe below average. Everyone is so good, Ethan. Like, scary good."

"You're a national champion."

"I was a big fish in a small pond. This is the ocean, and I'm realizing I'm actually a medium-sized fish who needs to get better or drown."

He laughed. "You're not going to drown. You're going to train and improve and come home better than you left."

"How was your course?"

"Started tomorrow. But I set up my room and met some of the other coaches. Everyone seems cool."

We talked for an hour—about nothing and everything, just hearing each other's voices after one day apart.

"I miss you," I said finally.

"Miss you too. But this is good for us. Growing independently."

"When did you get so wise?"

"Hanging out with this really smart badminton player. She's rubbing off on me."

Week one passed in a blur of training and exhaustion.

Up at 6 AM. Breakfast at 6:30. Training 7-11. Lunch. Video analysis 12-1. Training 2-6. Dinner. Evening conditioning 7-8. Collapse.

I called Ethan every night, sometimes too tired to form complete sentences.

"I hate footwork drills," I said on day three.

"You love footwork drills. You make me do them."

"I've changed my mind. They're torture."

"You're just tired."

"I'm exhausted. My coach made us do ladder drills for ninety minutes straight today. Ninety minutes. My legs don't work anymore."

"But are you improving?"

I thought about it. "Yeah. Actually yeah. My lateral movement is getting faster. My reaction time is improving. I'm starting to anticipate shots better."

"Then the torture is working."

By day seven, I'd found my rhythm. Still exhausted, still challenged, but adapting. Priya and I became actual friends—training partners who pushed each other and complained together and understood what this level of commitment required.

"You're getting better," she said on Saturday morning after a particularly good practice match. "Like, noticeably better. Your serves are sharper."

"Coach Kim's serve analysis helped. She broke down my mechanics and rebuilt them from scratch."

"That's what this program does. Breaks you down, rebuilds you stronger."

That night, I video called Ethan. He looked happy—relaxed in a way I hadn't seen in months.

"Coaching course is amazing," he said. "I'm learning so much about teaching methodology and age-appropriate development. It's basically sports psychology applied to children."

"You love it."

"I really do. It's hockey without pressure. Just pure teaching and development." He leaned back in his chair. "I think I might want to do this long-term. Coach, maybe teach at the college level eventually."

"What about playing?"

"I'll always play. Club hockey at MIT, maybe beyond. But I don't need it to be my career anymore." He smiled. "I get to love it without needing it. That's freedom."

"I'm proud of you."

"Back at you. National training program, holding your own with the best players in the country. That's huge."

We talked until midnight—about dreams and futures and plans that felt both distant and immediate.

"Two more weeks," I said before hanging up.

"Fourteen days. Then you're home."

"Then we pack for MIT."

"Then everything changes again."

"I'm ready for everything to change."

"Me too."

---

**TORONTO: WEEK TWO**

Week two was when everything clicked.

My body adapted to the training schedule. My skills sharpened under constant elite coaching. My mental game strengthened from training against players who challenged me.

On day ten, I beat Priya in a practice match—straight games, clean execution, complete control.

"That was incredible," she said afterward. "When did you get that good?"

"Right now, apparently."

Coach Kim pulled me aside. "Sophia, you've improved more in ten days than most athletes improve in six months. What changed?"

"I stopped being intimidated and started being curious."

"Explain."

"The first week I was scared of failing. This week I started asking questions—why do they move that way, how do they read shots, what am I missing?" I grabbed water, caught my breath. "I stopped competing with them and started learning from them."

"That's the difference between good and great." Coach Kim made a note on her clipboard. "Keep that mindset. You could make national team in two years if you maintain this trajectory."

National team. Two years. The timeline conflicted with MIT, but I filed it away to think about later.

I told Ethan that night.

"She said national team?" He sounded thrilled and terrified. "Sophie, that's incredible!"

"In two years. If I maintain improvement. If I commit full-time."

Silence on the other end.

"Which conflicts with MIT," Ethan said carefully.

"Which conflicts with MIT," I agreed. "But that's a future problem. Right now, I'm just training and learning."

"Are you thinking about it though? Deferring MIT for badminton?"

"No. Are you thinking about it? Playing club hockey instead of getting a degree?"

"No."

"Then we're on the same page. National team is a compliment and a possibility, not a plan."

"Okay. Good. I trust you."

"Good. Now tell me about your week."

His coaching course was wrapping up. He'd passed all his certifications, networked with coaches from across Canada, started thinking about what post-MIT coaching could look like.

"There's a program at MIT," he said. "Graduate level sports management. Combines coaching with administration and development. I could do engineering undergrad, then sports management for grad school."

"You're planning eight years ahead?"

"I'm thinking long-term. Is that weird?"

"It's ambitious. And kind of amazing." I smiled even though he couldn't see it. "You went from controlled NHL track to choosing your own complex path. That's growth."

"I learned from the best."

Week two ended with an inter-program tournament—all twenty athletes competing in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. I made it to the semifinals in singles, finals in women's doubles.

Lost the finals match in three games, but it was close. Competitive. Proof I belonged here.

"You're going to be dangerous next year," my doubles partner said. "If you come back."

"If?"

"Rumor is you're going to MIT. Can't do both."

"I'll figure it out."

On day fourteen, as I packed for one final week, Priya knocked on the open door.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"How do you balance everything? Elite athletics and elite academics? Everyone says you can't do both, but you're doing it."

I thought about how to answer honestly. "I'm not balancing. I'm choosing. Right now I'm choosing badminton. In August I choose MIT. Maybe later I choose something else. But I'm not trying to do everything at once."

"But the coaches here want full commitment."

"They want my best while I'm here. That's what I'm giving them." I zipped my bag. "When I'm at MIT, I'll give that my best. They're not competing. They're just different chapters."

"That's a really healthy way to think about it."

"I'm learning as I go. Ask me in a year if it's actually working."

---

**TORONTO: WEEK THREE**

The final week was both intense and bittersweet.

We all knew this was ending. Three weeks of living and breathing badminton, then back to real life.

For some athletes, this was life—they'd go home and train full-time, pursue national team spots, commit to professional development.

For others, like me, this was a moment. Important, formative, but not forever.

On day seventeen, we had a team meeting with national team selectors.

"We've been watching all of you," the head selector said. "Several of you show serious potential for national team development. You'll receive individual meetings before you leave."

I got called in on day eighteen.

"Sophia, you've been impressive. Your improvement curve is steep, your work ethic is excellent, and your mental game is mature beyond your years."

"Thank you."

"We'd like to invite you to winter training camp. December 26th through January 15th. Here in Toronto. Elite development with potential national team call-up after."

Three weeks spanning MIT's winter break. Doable, maybe.

"Can I think about it?"

"Of course. Let us know by September 1st."

I called Ethan immediately.

"They want me for winter training," I said without preamble.

"That's amazing! When?"

"December 26th through January 15th. Three weeks during winter break."

"So you'd miss New Year's with me."

"Yeah."

Silence.

"You should do it," Ethan said finally.

"You sure?"

"No. But you should do it anyway." He sighed. "We're both going to have opportunities that complicate things. This is yours. Take it."

"What if MIT winter break is when we need time together?"

"Then we'll figure it out. We always do."

The final training session was on July 10th—day twenty-one. We did a full simulation tournament, playing our hearts out one last time.

I won my bracket. Lost the overall finals. Felt proud anyway.

That night, the program hosted a farewell dinner. All twenty athletes, all the coaches, everyone who'd made these three weeks possible.

Coach Kim gave a speech. "You came here good. You're leaving great. Some of you will go on to represent Canada internationally. Some will play in college. Some will stop competing and just remember this as the summer you were excellent. All of those paths are valid. I'm proud of all of you."

After dinner, Priya and I walked around the Toronto waterfront.

"What are you going to do?" she asked. "National team track or MIT?"

"Both, somehow. I'll figure it out."

"You're crazy."

"Probably. But I'm not giving up either thing without trying."

"That's very you."

"Is that a compliment?"

"Absolutely."

I flew home on August 11th—exhausted, improved, changed.

Ethan met me at the airport with flowers and a smile that made everything worth it.

"You look different," he said.

"I am different. Stronger. Faster. Better at badminton."

"Still the same Sophie?"

"Still the same Sophie. Just evolved."

We drove home talking nonstop—three weeks condensed into ninety minutes of conversation. His coaching certification, my training evolution, the plans we'd made separately and together.

At my house, my parents had a "Welcome Home" banner and my favorite dinner ready.

"We missed you," Mom said.

"Missed you too."

Caroline joined us for dinner—bringing updates about her architecture projects and the apartment she'd fully settled into. Robert was conspicuously absent from all conversations. The divorce was progressing. He'd apparently stopped trying to contact Ethan entirely.

"He's moved on to controlling something else," Caroline said. "Probably his golf game. I don't care anymore."

After dinner, Ethan and I escaped to the backyard.

"Four days until we leave for MIT," he said.

"Four days to pack everything we own."

"Four days to say goodbye to Winnipeg."

"Are you ready?"

He thought about it. "No. But I'm going anyway. You?"

"Same. Terrified and excited in equal measure."

"That seems to be our default state."

We sat in comfortable silence as summer evening settled around us.

"Thank you," I said.

"For what?"

"For making me go to Toronto. For supporting me even when it meant being apart. For not asking me to choose between you and opportunities."

"Back at you." He took my hand. "We both chose ourselves this summer. And we're still choosing each other. That's huge."

"It really is."

The next four days blurred together in a chaos of packing and goodbyes.

Packing for MIT meant figuring out what to bring to a new life—clothes for Boston weather, badminton gear, school supplies, photos of people who mattered, pieces of home to make a dorm room feel safe.

My parents helped. Caroline helped. Ethan and I helped each other, comparing lists and making sure we didn't forget essentials.

"Do we need winter coats?" Ethan asked.

"We're from Winnipeg moving to Boston. Yes, we need winter coats."

"But how cold does Boston actually get?"

"Cold enough. Pack the coat."

On August 14th—our last full day in Winnipeg—we did one final drive around the city.

Past the school we'd graduated from. Past the park where we'd had breakthrough conversations. Past the rink where everything had started, back when we were just kids who used to skate together.

"This city gave us everything," Ethan said.

"This city tried to kill us several times."

"True. But we survived. That counts for something."

We ended at The Forks—our spot, where the rivers meet and the city feels both huge and intimate.

"Last night in Winnipeg," I said.

"First night of everything else."

"Are we really doing this?"

"Flying to Boston tomorrow to start college at MIT? Yeah, we're really doing this."

I leaned against him, watching the sun set over the city that had challenged us and changed us.

"I'm scared," I admitted.

"Me too."

"But excited."

"Me too."

"Together though."

"Always together."

Tomorrow, we'd fly to Boston. Tomorrow, MIT would begin. Tomorrow, everything would change.

But tonight, we were still Winnipeg kids—survivors of impossible circumstances, graduates of hard lessons, ready for whatever came next.

Together.

Always together.
