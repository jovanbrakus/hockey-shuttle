# Chapter 6: New Beginnings

The flight from Winnipeg to Boston took four hours, but it felt like crossing into a different universe.

Ethan and I sat together—middle and window seats, our parents scattered throughout the plane. Our entire lives packed into checked luggage underneath us. Everything we owned, everything we'd need to start over, compressed into suitcases and carry-ons.

"What if we hate it?" Ethan asked as we flew over the Great Lakes.

"Then we transfer."

"What if we're not smart enough?"

"Then we study harder."

"What if we don't fit in?"

"Then we find people who fit with us." I took his hand. "Stop catastrophizing. We're going to be fine."

"You don't know that."

"I know we've survived everything thrown at us so far. MIT is just the next challenge."

He squeezed my hand. "Together?"

"Always together."

We landed at Logan Airport at 2:30 PM Eastern time. August in Boston was humid and hot—nothing like Winnipeg's dry prairie summer.

Caroline had flown in separately and was already waiting at baggage claim. My parents appeared with luggage carts, looking both excited and sad.

"This is really happening," Mom said.

"This is really happening," I confirmed.

We loaded everything into two rental cars and drove to campus.

The first view of MIT took my breath away.

Classical buildings mixed with modern architecture. The iconic Great Dome visible from Massachusetts Avenue. Students everywhere—moving in, exploring, existing in this space that was now ours.

"We go here," Ethan said, staring.

"We go here," I repeated.

My dorm—Next House—was on the west side of campus, close to the athletics facilities. Modern building, good location, co-ed by floor.

We unloaded my things in front of the building where dozens of other families were doing the same thing. Chaos everywhere—parents crying, students hugging, RAs directing traffic.

A girl appeared at my elbow. "Sophia Liu?"

I turned. She was Black, athletic build, warm smile, already wearing MIT gear.

"Yeah?"

"I'm Maya Williams. Your roommate." She pulled me into a hug like we'd been friends for years. "I've been stalking your Instagram. National badminton champion? That's so cool."

"Uh, thanks?"

"Come on, let's get you moved in. Fourth floor, east corner. Great view of campus." She grabbed one of my bags. "Fair warning: I'm very organized and kind of loud. If that's going to drive you crazy, tell me now."

I liked her immediately.

My room was small but functional—two beds, two desks, two dressers, one window overlooking campus. Maya had already decorated her side with posters and photos and strings of lights.

"I got here yesterday," she explained. "Couldn't wait. My parents drove from San Diego, and we did the full tourist thing in Boston first."

As we unpacked, Ethan texted: *Getting settled. Room is tiny. Roommate seems cool but quiet. How's yours?*

I responded: *Opposite problem. Roommate is wonderful and extremely not quiet. Fourth floor, great view. Come by later?*

*After I unpack. Parents are emotional. Send help.*

Maya noticed me smiling at my phone. "The boyfriend?"

"The boyfriend."

"The one who turned down the NHL?"

"Does everyone know that story?"

"I googled both of you when I got the roommate assignment. I'm thorough." She hung up more clothes. "So is he actually as smart as his transcript suggests, or is that just good grades?"

"Actually that smart. Annoyingly smart, sometimes."

"Perfect. I hate dating stupid people. Too much explaining."

I laughed. "We're going to get along fine."

It took three hours to unpack and organize. My parents helped, Caroline stopped by with Ethan to say hello, and gradually my half of the room became mine.

Photos on the wall: me and Ethan at prom, my family, my badminton team, Caroline and my parents at graduation. Evidence of where I'd come from.

MIT sweatshirt hung on the closet door—the one my parents had given us at graduation dinner.

Badminton rackets in the corner—three of them, backup strings, a full kit.

This was home now. This small room with a stranger who was becoming a friend, in a building full of people I didn't know yet, on a campus that felt both enormous and intimate.

At 6 PM, Maya and I headed to the dining hall for the first-year welcome dinner.

The dining hall was packed—700+ freshmen trying to find seats, meeting roommates and hallmates, forming the first social connections that would define the next four years.

I found Ethan in the crowd. He was with his roommate—a quiet Asian guy who looked mildly overwhelmed.

"Sophie, this is Jay Patterson. Jay, Sophia Liu."

Jay nodded. "The badminton player. Ethan mentioned."

"That's me. You're computer science?"

"AI specialization. You're mechanical engineering?"

"That's the plan."

We sat together—me, Ethan, Maya, Jay, and a few other students from our dorms. The conversation flowed easily: where we were from, what we were studying, why we chose MIT.

"I'm from California," Maya said. "Wanted to get far away from home, prove I could survive east coast weather."

"I'm from Texas," Jay added. "Wanted the best computer science program in the country."

"Canada," Ethan said. "We both are. Winnipeg."

"And you turned down a professional hockey contract to be here," another student—introduced as Rachel from our floor—said. "That story is everywhere."

Ethan winced. "It's really not that interesting."

"You turned down millions of dollars. That's interesting."

"I chose education over money. Lots of people do that."

"Not at eighteen with a guaranteed contract."

I could see Ethan getting uncomfortable—the attention, the judgment, the constant reminder of his choice.

"He chose what he wanted instead of what people expected," I said firmly. "That's the whole story. Can we talk about something else?"

Rachel backed off. The conversation shifted to classes, schedules, orientation week plans.

But I could feel Ethan tense beside me. This was going to be his identity at MIT—the hockey player who said no. The guy who chose differently. The story everyone would know before knowing him.

After dinner, we walked across campus toward Killian Court—the great lawn in front of the dome.

"I'm going to be that guy forever," Ethan said. "The NHL guy. That's all anyone's going to know about me."

"Until they actually know you. Then you're the brilliant engineering student who happens to love hockey."

"That's not what they see."

"Not yet. But they will."

We found a bench near the dome. Other students were scattered around—on the grass, on benches, exploring their new home.

"I'm terrified," Ethan admitted.

"Of what?"

"Everything. Classes starting Monday. The workload. Whether I'm actually smart enough for this place." He looked at the dome, lit up against the darkening sky. "What if I made the wrong choice?"

"Then you made it honestly, and you'll adjust accordingly." I leaned against him. "But you didn't make the wrong choice. You made the brave choice."

"Brave feels like stupid right now."

"They're often the same thing."

We sat in silence as the sky darkened and lights came on across campus. Somewhere in the distance, someone was playing guitar. A group of students laughed as they walked past. Normal college sounds for an abnormal situation.

"We're really here," I said.

"We're really here."

"Classes start in four days."

"Orientation first. Then classes. Then we find out if we can actually do this."

"We can do this."

"How are you so confident?"

"I'm not. I'm just better at pretending."

Over the next three days, orientation consumed us.

Academic advising sessions where we finalized fall schedules. Campus tours showing us buildings we'd spend the next four years in. Student activities fair with 200+ clubs competing for attention.

I stopped by the badminton club table. The president—a junior named Alex—recognized me immediately.

"You're the national champion. From Canada, right?"

"That's me."

"We'd love to have you. Practice three times a week, matches on weekends, very competitive but also fun." He handed me a flyer. "First practice is next week. You should come."

I took the flyer, filed it away mentally. Badminton three times a week. MIT academics full-time. Relationship with Ethan. Social life. Sleep.

Something would have to give.

Ethan stopped by the club hockey table. The team captain—a senior named Mike—also recognized him.

"You're the kid who turned down Detroit."

"That's me."

"Heard you're pretty good. Want to try out for varsity?"

Ethan blinked. "I thought this was club hockey."

"This table is club. But I also captain varsity. We could use a talented center." Mike pulled out a different flyer. "Tryouts are next week. Much bigger time commitment than club—we practice five times a week, travel for games. But we compete at a high level."

"I chose MIT to focus on academics."

"You can do both. Lots of guys do." Mike shrugged. "Think about it. Tryouts are Wednesday at 6 PM."

After we left the activities fair, Ethan looked shell-shocked.

"He wants me to try out for varsity."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know. That's not why I came here."

"But you love hockey."

"I love hockey without pressure. Varsity hockey at MIT is probably still pressure."

"Or it's challenging yourself while staying in the sport you love." I adjusted the stack of flyers I'd collected. "You don't have to decide today. Just think about it."

On August 18th, we had our first official dorm floor meeting.

Next House 4th floor had twenty students—mix of genders, majors, backgrounds. Our RA—a senior named Chris—welcomed us and laid down ground rules.

"You're all adults now. I'm not here to parent you. But I am here if you need help, advice, or someone to talk to." He looked around the circle. "MIT is hard. Really hard. Some of you will struggle. That's normal. What's not normal is suffering alone. If you're drowning, tell someone."

After the official meeting, the floor gathered in the common room for informal introductions.

Maya immediately took charge, getting everyone to share names, majors, and "one weird fact about yourself."

"I'm Maya Williams, mechanical engineering, and I can juggle while riding a unicycle."

"I'm Rachel Kim, biology, and I've never eaten a vegetable."

"I'm Sophia Liu, mechanical engineering, and I won a national badminton championship using a racket I bought at a garage sale."

Laughter around the circle.

When it was done, Maya pulled me aside. "We're going to have a good year."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. This floor has good energy. I can tell."

That night, Ethan and I met at Killian Court again—our spot, apparently.

"How's your floor?" I asked.

"Quiet. Lots of engineers and computer science people who seem more comfortable with computers than humans." He smiled. "Jay is cool though. We're figuring each other out."

"Maya is wonderful and exhausting in equal measure."

"That tracks."

We lay on the grass looking at stars that were barely visible through Boston light pollution.

"Classes start Monday," I said.

"Four days. Then it's real."

"It's already real."

"You know what I mean. Then we find out if we're actually smart enough for this place."

"We are."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I believe it." I turned to face him. "We got in. We belong here. We're going to struggle and learn and survive. That's the whole point."

"When did you become the confident one?"

"Toronto. Three weeks of elite training taught me I can adapt to anything."

"I should have done something intense this summer."

"You got coaching certified. That's intense."

"It's not the same as—"

His phone rang. Unknown number. He ignored it.

It immediately rang again. Same number.

"You should answer that," I said.

He did, reluctantly. "Hello?"

His face went white.

"This is Ethan... Yes, sir... I—what?... But I'm enrolled... I understand... Can you hold on?"

He pulled the phone away, looked at me with an expression I couldn't read.

"It's Jim Morrison. The Detroit scout."

My stomach dropped.

"What does he want?"

"Their starting center tore his ACL yesterday. They have an emergency roster spot." He swallowed hard. "They want me. Now. Training camp starts September 1st."

---

**THE CALL**

Ethan walked away from me to finish the conversation. I sat on the grass, watching him pace, trying to read his body language from fifty feet away.

He talked for fifteen minutes. Then hung up. Stood very still for a moment.

Then walked back.

"They're offering $3.2 million signing bonus," he said numbly. "Emergency call-up. Guaranteed roster spot for the season. Training camp starts in two weeks."

"Classes start in four days."

"I know."

"You just got here. We just got here."

"I know."

"What did you tell them?"

"That I needed to think about it. That I'd call back in 48 hours." He sat down next to me, ran his hands through his hair. "Sophie, this is—"

"Enormous. I know."

"I thought the door was closed. I chose MIT. I moved on."

"And now the door opened again."

"Everything's different now. They're desperate. They need immediate help. I'd actually play, not sit on the bench for a year."

"But you'd miss MIT."

"Maybe just this semester. I could defer until January, play the first half of the season—"

"MIT doesn't work that way. You know that."

He did know that. We both did.

If he left for Detroit now, MIT was gone. Maybe he could reapply next year, but there was no guarantee.

This wasn't a small choice. This was everything.

"What do you want to do?" I asked.

"I don't know." He looked at me helplessly. "Three months ago I knew exactly what I wanted. Now I'm here and the NHL is calling again and I—I don't know."

"Do you want to go?"

"Part of me does. The part that's been playing hockey since age four. The part that dreams about professional competition." He swallowed hard. "But part of me wants to stay. The part that chose education. The part that chose you."

"Don't choose because of me."

"You're part of the decision. You're part of everything."

We sat in silence. Around us, other students laughed and lived and existed in their normal orientation week. Meanwhile, our foundation was cracking again.

"I need to think," Ethan said finally. "Can I—I need to be alone for a bit. Process this."

"Of course."

"I'm not leaving you. I'm just—"

"I know. Go. Think. We'll talk tomorrow."

He kissed me—quick and desperate—then walked away toward his dorm.

I sat alone on the grass as the sky darkened and my phone buzzed.

Maya: *Where are you? Floor is doing ice cream run.*

I responded: *Can't tonight. Dealing with something.*

Maya: *You okay?*

*Not really. But I will be.*

I stayed at Killian Court for another hour, trying to process what had just happened.

We'd made it. We'd fought for months to get here. We'd chosen MIT over everything else. And now, four days before classes started, the universe was testing us again.

If Ethan left for Detroit, I'd lose him. Not necessarily the relationship—maybe we could handle long distance—but lose him from this experience. From MIT, from our plan, from the future we'd been building.

But if he stayed because of me, because he was afraid of disappointing me, he'd resent it eventually.

There was no good answer.

---

**AUGUST 19TH - DECISION EVE**

I barely slept. At 7 AM, Ethan texted: *Can we talk?*

We met at a coffee shop off campus—neutral territory, away from students who might recognize us.

He looked like he hadn't slept either.

"I spent all night thinking," he said.

"And?"

"And I keep coming back to the same question: am I choosing MIT because I want it, or because I'm afraid of disappointing you?"

"What's your answer?"

"I don't know. Three months ago when I first chose, it was clear. I wanted education, growth, time to develop. But now I'm here and it's overwhelming and the NHL is offering everything I trained for and I—" He stopped. "What if I made the wrong choice in June?"

"Then you adjust. Make a different choice now."

"You'd be okay with that?"

"No. I'd be devastated." I met his eyes. "But I'd rather you choose honestly than stay because you think you owe me something."

"I don't think I owe you. I just—I don't want to lose you."

"You won't lose me by choosing what you want."

"Won't I though?" He leaned back, exhausted. "If I go to Detroit, we're done. You're here, I'm there. Long distance at eighteen while I'm playing 82 games a season? That's not sustainable."

"So you're choosing between MIT and me, or NHL and losing me."

"I'm choosing between the path I planned and the path that just opened up. You're part of both equations."

The coffee shop was filling with students—mostly upperclassmen, some we'd met during orientation. Normal college kids getting coffee before normal college days.

We were anything but normal.

"Can I tell you what I think?" I said carefully.

"Please."

"I think you're panicking. I think MIT is overwhelming and scary and the NHL is familiar and safe—"

"Safe? NHL hockey?"

"Safer than admitting you're not sure you're smart enough for MIT. Safer than facing the unknown." I took his hand across the table. "Three months ago you made a careful, thoughtful decision based on what you wanted your life to look like. This decision is being made in crisis mode with a 48-hour deadline."

"So you think I should stay."

"I think you should ask yourself which choice you're making because you want to, and which you're making because you're afraid."

He closed his eyes. "I hate that question."

"I know. But it's the right question."

We sat in silence. His coffee went cold. Mine too.

Finally, Ethan pulled out his phone. "I'm going to call my mom."

He stepped outside. I watched through the window as he paced and talked, hands gesturing, clearly emotional.

He came back in ten minutes later.

"What did she say?"

"She asked me if I'd be calling Jim Morrison if classes hadn't started yet. If I'd be reconsidering if MIT wasn't currently terrifying."

"What did you tell her?"

"That I didn't know. Maybe?" He sat down. "She said that was my answer. That if I'm only running to the NHL because MIT is scary, I'll regret it."

"Do you agree?"

"I think I'm terrified of failing here. I think the NHL seems easier because I know I'm good at hockey. But I don't know if I'm good at MIT-level academics."

"Nobody knows that until they try."

"What if I try and fail?"

"Then you try again. Or you transfer. Or you adjust expectations." I squeezed his hand. "But running away before you even start doesn't answer the question."

He was quiet for a long time.

"I'm staying," he said finally.

"Are you sure?"

"No. But I'm sure that leaving now would be running away from fear, not running toward something I actually want." He looked at me. "I chose MIT in June when I had time to think clearly. I'm trusting that version of myself."

"Okay."

"Okay? That's it?"

"What do you want me to say? I'm relieved you're staying, terrified you'll resent me for it, and proud that you're facing the fear instead of avoiding it." I managed a smile. "Welcome to complicated feelings."

"I need to call Jim."

"Do it now. Before you second-guess yourself."

He did. Right there in the coffee shop, on speaker so I could hear.

"Jim, it's Ethan Mercer."

"Ethan. Have you made a decision?"

"I have. Thank you for the opportunity—genuinely, thank you. But I'm staying at MIT."

Silence on the other end.

"You're sure this time?" Jim asked carefully.

"I'm sure. MIT is where I'm supposed to be right now. Hockey will always be there in some form. But this opportunity—being here, starting college, building a different kind of life—this only happens once."

"Alright. I respect that." Jim sighed. "For the record, I think you're making the right choice. But this really is the last time, Ethan. After this, the door closes."

"I understand."

"Good luck, kid. You're going to need it."

After he hung up, Ethan set his phone down very carefully.

"It's done."

"How do you feel?"

"Terrified. Relieved. Like I might throw up."

"That's appropriate."

"Did I just make a massive mistake?"

"Ask me in four years."

We left the coffee shop holding hands, walking back toward campus in the August heat.

"Classes start Monday," I said.

"Two days."

"Are you ready?"

"Absolutely not. You?"

"Not even a little bit."

"We're going to struggle, aren't we?"

"Probably. But together."

"Together," he echoed.

---

**AUGUST 20TH - LAST DAY BEFORE CLASSES**

Orientation week ended with a massive student activities fair and welcome ceremony.

The ceremony was in Killian Court—all 1,100 freshmen gathered on the lawn while the president welcomed us and upper-level students performed ridiculous traditions.

"You're MIT now," the president said. "That means you're expected to do impossible things. To push boundaries. To fail and try again. To build and break and rebuild better."

I looked at Ethan. He looked at me.

We'd already been doing that for months.

"Some of you will struggle this year," the president continued. "That's normal. What matters is what you do when you struggle. Do you give up, or do you ask for help? Do you quit, or do you adapt?"

After the ceremony, Maya dragged me to the activities fair.

"Badminton club is here. You're signing up."

"I don't know if I have time."

"You're a national champion. You have time." She pulled me to the table where Alex—the club president—was waiting.

"Sophia! You came!"

"My roommate made me."

"Good roommate." He handed me a signup sheet. "First practice is Wednesday at 6 PM. Bring your gear. We're going to work you hard."

I signed up before I could talk myself out of it.

Ethan found me after, holding a varsity hockey tryout form.

"I'm thinking about it," he said.

"The tryout?"

"Varsity. Mike made a good point—I can love hockey without it being my whole life. Maybe varsity hockey at MIT is different than professional pressure."

"Are you going to try out?"

"Wednesday at 6 PM. Same time as your badminton practice." He smiled. "We'll struggle with time management together."

"Together," I agreed.

That night, our floor had one last orientation event—an informal gathering in the common room to celebrate before classes started.

Someone brought cookies. Someone else brought music. We sat around talking about summer, about fears, about excitement.

"What are you most nervous about?" Rachel asked the group.

"Failing physics," one student said.

"Not making friends," another admitted.

"Not being smart enough," Jay said quietly. Ethan nodded agreement.

When it got to me, I said: "Balancing everything. Academics, athletics, relationship, sleep. Something's going to have to give, and I don't know what."

"Sleep," Maya said immediately. "Sleep is always what gives."

"Encouraging."

"Honest."

At 11 PM, the gathering broke up. Students drifted to their rooms to prepare for tomorrow.

Ethan walked me to my door.

"Last night before classes start," he said.

"Tomorrow it's real."

"Tomorrow we find out if we can actually do this."

"We can do this."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I believe it." I kissed him goodnight. "Get some sleep. We're going to need it."

---

**AUGUST 21ST - FIRST DAY**

My alarm went off at 7 AM.

First class: Calculus II, 9 AM, in a massive lecture hall across campus.

I dressed carefully—nothing too formal, nothing too casual, trying to look like I belonged at MIT even though I felt like an imposter.

Maya was already awake, somehow energetic despite the early hour.

"First day! This is going to be amazing!"

"This is going to be terrifying."

"Same thing!"

We walked to class together—along with half our floor, all heading to various first-day classes.

The lecture hall was enormous. Two hundred seats arranged in ascending rows, a massive screen at the front, chalkboards covering the walls.

I found a seat near the middle. Ethan appeared a few minutes later, sliding into the seat next to me.

"Found you."

"We have this class together. Of course you found me."

"Moral support though."

The professor walked in at 8:59—exactly on time, carrying a briefcase and an aura of intense intelligence.

"Good morning. I'm Professor Chen. Welcome to Calculus II."

She wrote on the board: **18.02 - MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS**

"This course has a 40% drop rate. Look to your left. Look to your right. Statistically, one of you won't be here by midterms."

Students looked around nervously. I felt Ethan tense beside me.

"If you're not prepared to work harder than you've ever worked, leave now. This course demands precision, dedication, and the ability to think in multiple dimensions simultaneously."

No one left.

"Good. Let's begin."

For the next ninety minutes, Professor Chen taught at a pace that was both exhilarating and terrifying. Concepts built on concepts, equations filled the board, students frantically took notes.

I kept up. Barely. My hand cramped from writing.

Ethan looked shell-shocked.

When class ended, students filed out looking dazed.

"That was intense," I said.

"That was impossible. There's no way we can keep up with that pace for an entire semester."

"We'll figure it out."

"How are you so calm?"

"I'm not calm. I'm just good at pretending."

We had a break before our next classes—Physics I at 1 PM for me, Chemistry for him at 2 PM.

We found a bench outside, sitting in the August heat, processing what we'd just experienced.

"First class at MIT," Ethan said.

"First of many."

"I already have three hours of homework due Wednesday."

"Same. Plus reading for engineering seminar tomorrow."

Around us, other students were having similar realizations. This wasn't high school. This was MIT, where brilliant people worked constantly and still struggled.

"We can do this," I said, more to myself than to him.

"Can we?"

"We got in. We belong here."

"Getting in and surviving are different things."

"Then we'll learn to survive." I stood up. "Come on. We have four more hours of classes today. Might as well keep going."

The rest of the day was a blur—Physics lecture, lab section, engineering introduction seminar. By 6 PM, I was intellectually exhausted in a way I'd never experienced before.

I dragged myself to the badminton practice I'd signed up for.

The gymnasium was already full of players warming up. Alex saw me and waved.

"Sophia! Ready to play?"

"Ready to collapse, but sure."

We played for ninety minutes—drills, rally practice, strategy sessions. I was good here. This I understood. Physical excellence, technique, competition.

After practice, Alex pulled me aside.

"You're really good. Like, legitimately elite good."

"Thanks."

"We compete at a high level. Regional tournaments, national club championships. If you commit, we could win a lot."

"How much commitment?"

"Three practices a week, tournaments every other weekend, training on off days."

I calculated: three practices, tournaments, studying, classes, relationship time, sleep.

Something would definitely have to give.

"Can I think about it?"

"Sure. But we'd love to have you at that level."

I walked back to my dorm as the sun set, trying to figure out how to fit twenty-seven hours of commitments into a twenty-four-hour day.

Ethan texted: *How was badminton?*

*Intense. Good. How was your evening?*

*Studied for three hours. Still have four more to go. This is unsustainable.*

*We've been here for one day.*

*Exactly.*

When I got back to my room, Maya was at her desk surrounded by textbooks.

"How was badminton?"

"They want me to compete at a high level. Big time commitment."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know how to fit it in."

"Welcome to MIT. Where time management is a required skill they don't actually teach you." She highlighted something in her textbook. "You'll figure it out. We all do."

I sat at my desk, pulled out my own homework. Calculus problem set: fifteen problems, due Wednesday. Physics reading: forty pages, quiz Friday.

It was 8 PM. I'd been awake for thirteen hours. I had at least four more hours of work ahead of me.

This was MIT.

This was what we'd chosen.

---

**AUGUST 22ND - THE SECOND CALL**

I woke at 7 AM to my phone ringing.

Ethan's name on the screen.

"It's 7 AM. Why are you calling?"

"Jim Morrison called again." His voice was shaking.

I sat up immediately. "What?"

"Same injury situation. They're desperate. They bumped the offer to $3.5 million signing bonus. Training camp starts September 1st."

"You told him no yesterday."

"I know. But he called again. Said the GM wants to talk to me directly. Said this is genuinely the last opportunity."

"Ethan—"

"I know. I know I chose MIT. But Sophie, classes yesterday were impossible. The homework is already overwhelming. And the NHL is right there offering money and a path I already understand."

"You've been here for two days."

"Two days that have shown me I might not be smart enough for this place."

"That's fear talking."

"That's reality talking." He sounded desperate. "What if I'm destroying my NHL career to fail out of MIT? What if I'm not good enough for either path?"

"Come to my room. We need to talk face to face."

He showed up fifteen minutes later, looking like he hadn't slept.

Maya took one look at us and grabbed her backpack. "I'm going to study in the library. Take your time."

After she left, Ethan collapsed on my bed.

"Tell me what to do," he said.

"I can't do that."

"Yes, you can. Tell me to stay. Tell me MIT is worth it. Tell me—"

"I can't make this decision for you. That's the whole point." I sat next to him. "If you want to go to Detroit, go. If you want to stay at MIT, stay. But decide for the right reasons."

"What are the right reasons?"

"Choosing what you want, not what you're afraid of."

He was quiet for a long time.

"I'm afraid of failing here. But I'm also afraid of regretting not trying." He looked at me. "Which fear wins?"

"The one you can live with."

"That's not helpful."

"It's honest."

His phone rang. Unknown number. Detroit area code.

"That's the GM," Ethan said, staring at it.

"Are you going to answer?"

"I don't know."

The phone kept ringing.

Finally, it went to voicemail.

Immediately, a text: *This is Tom Wilson, Detroit Red Wings GM. I'd like to speak with you directly about our offer. Please call me at your earliest convenience.*

Ethan showed me the text.

"He's serious," I said.

"They're desperate. Injury, thin roster, immediate need." He read the text again. "This is real."

"So is MIT. So is the choice you already made."

"But what if I was wrong?"

"Then you were wrong honestly. You can live with honest mistakes."

He stood up, paced my small room. "I need to think. I need—can I just sit here for a bit? Not talk, just exist?"

"Of course."

So we sat in silence. Me at my desk pretending to do homework. Him on my bed staring at the ceiling.

An hour passed.

Finally, Ethan pulled out his phone.

"I'm calling the GM."

My heart stopped.

He put it on speaker.

"Mr. Wilson, this is Ethan Mercer returning your call."

"Ethan! Thanks for calling back." Professional voice, warm but businesslike. "I wanted to speak with you directly about our offer. I know you've chosen MIT, and I respect that. But our situation is unique. We have an immediate need, and you're our first choice to fill it."

"I appreciate that, sir."

"Let me be clear about what we're offering: $3.5 million signing bonus, guaranteed roster spot, no bench time. You'd be playing significant minutes from day one. This is not a development opportunity. This is a professional career starting right now."

"I understand."

"And I know you're at MIT. I know you've started classes. But MIT will be there in a year. This opportunity won't." Wilson paused. "Can I ask what's holding you back?"

Ethan looked at me. I kept my face neutral.

"I chose MIT because I wanted to prove I'm more than just a hockey player," Ethan said slowly. "Because I wanted education and growth and time to figure out who I am without someone controlling me. The NHL is incredible, but it's also all-consuming. I'd lose everything else."

"You'd gain a career most people only dream about."

"I know. But I've spent seventeen years having my dreams chosen for me. MIT is the first thing I've chosen entirely for myself."

"So you're saying no."

Long pause.

"Yes, sir. I'm saying no. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for the opportunities. But I'm staying at MIT."

"You're absolutely certain."

"I'm terrified and uncertain and convinced I might be making a mistake. But yes, I'm certain. This is my choice."

Wilson sighed. "I respect that, Ethan. I wish you were making a different choice, but I respect it. Good luck at MIT."

"Thank you, sir."

After he hung up, Ethan sat very still.

"I did it," he said.

"You did."

"I turned down $3.5 million dollars."

"You chose yourself."

"I'm going to throw up."

"Breathe."

He breathed. In and out, slow and steady, trying to believe he'd made the right choice.

"What if I regret this?" he asked quietly.

"Then you'll regret something you chose honestly instead of something you chose out of fear."

"That's supposed to be comforting?"

"It's supposed to be true."

He lay back on my bed, stared at my ceiling. "I can't believe I just did that."

"I can. You're brave."

"I'm terrified."

"Those are often the same thing."

My phone buzzed. Text from Maya: *Is it safe to come back yet?*

I responded: *Give us five more minutes.*

Ethan sat up. "I should go. Let you study. We both have impossible amounts of work."

"Are you okay?"

"Ask me in four years."

At the door, he turned back. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not making the decision for me. For asking hard questions. For being here."

"Always."

After he left, I tried to focus on homework. Failed completely. Called my parents instead.

"Sophie?" Mom answered. "Everything okay? It's early there."

"Ethan got another NHL offer. Bigger than the first. He turned it down an hour ago."

Silence.

"Is he okay?" Dad asked—they'd put me on speaker.

"I think so. Terrified, but okay."

"Are you okay?"

"I don't know. Part of me is relieved he's staying. Part of me is afraid he'll resent me for being part of why he stayed. Part of me thinks we're both crazy for being at MIT when we could be doing other things."

"That's a lot of parts," Mom said gently.

"Welcome to being eighteen and making life-altering decisions."

"You're going to be fine," Dad said. "Both of you. You're smart enough for MIT, brave enough to make hard choices, and stubborn enough to survive when it gets difficult."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're our daughter. Stubbornness is genetic."

I laughed despite everything.

After we hung up, I finally managed to focus on homework. Calculus problems that made my brain hurt. Physics reading that required three passes to understand.

At midnight, Maya came back.

"Is the crisis over?"

"For now."

"Good. Because we have a quiz tomorrow in chemistry and I need your brain."

We studied until 2 AM. Went to bed exhausted. Woke at 7 AM to do it all over again.

This was MIT.

This was what we'd chosen.

**AUGUST 24TH - THE FINAL COMPLICATION**

Wednesday afternoon, after my badminton practice, Alex pulled me aside again.

"Sophia, I need to talk to you about something important."

"Okay?"

"There's a national team exhibition match in October. In Toronto. They've specifically requested you to play."

My heart stopped.

"What?"

"The national team coach saw you at summer training. They want you for an exhibition match against Team USA. October 15th through 18th. You'd miss four days of classes."

Four days. In the middle of midterm season. Missing lectures, problem sets, labs.

"I can't. Classes—"

"I know. But this is national team, Sophia. This is what you trained for all summer."

"When do I need to decide?"

"Next week. But think about it seriously. Opportunities like this don't come around often."

I walked back to my dorm in a daze.

MIT academics. National team badminton. Both demanding full commitment. Both impossible to do halfway.

Something would have to give.

Meanwhile, Ethan was dealing with his own complication.

He showed up at my room at 7 PM, right as I was starting homework.

"The varsity hockey coach called."

"And?"

"He wants me to try out. Says I'd be a strong addition to the team. Practices five times a week, games every weekend, travel to other schools."

"That's a huge commitment."

"I know. But he also said it would help with admissions to grad programs later. That MIT values students who can balance academics and athletics at a high level."

"Do you want to do it?"

"I want to play hockey. I don't know if I want that much hockey while also surviving MIT academics."

We looked at each other.

"We're both facing the same choice," I said.

"Commit to our sports at a high level, or focus on academics."

"Can't we do both?"

"I don't know. Can we?"

My phone buzzed. Email from my calculus professor: *First problem set scores posted. Class average: 58%. If you scored below 70%, please see me during office hours.*

I checked my score: 73%. Barely above the threshold.

Ethan checked his: 69%.

"I got a 69 on the first problem set," he said. "At MIT. On day three."

"I got a 73. We're both struggling."

"And we're considering adding more commitments?"

"Maybe we need the balance. Maybe doing only academics would burn us out faster."

"Or maybe we're both crazy and should focus on not failing out."

We sat in silence, trying to figure out how to be successful at everything when we could barely manage one thing.

A knock on the door. Maya stuck her head in.

"Floor meeting in ten minutes. Chris says it's mandatory."

We trudged to the common room where our RA was waiting with serious expression.

"How's everyone doing?" Chris asked.

Silence. Exhausted faces.

"That's what I thought. Week one of MIT is brutal. You're all realizing that being smart in high school doesn't automatically translate to being successful here." He looked around. "Here's what I need you to understand: struggling is normal. It doesn't mean you don't belong. It means you're being challenged appropriately."

"What if we're failing?" someone asked.

"If you're getting 60-70% on first assignments, you're doing fine. MIT is designed to push you past your limits. The goal isn't perfection. It's growth."

"So we're supposed to be okay with 70%?" Rachel asked.

"You're supposed to be okay with trying your hardest and sometimes falling short. That's how learning works."

After the meeting, Ethan and I walked to Killian Court—our spot.

"One week at MIT," he said.

"One week down, four years to go."

"I already have a badminton decision to make and a hockey tryout to consider."

"I already have a national team opportunity and academics I'm barely managing."

"What are we going to do?"

"I don't know."

We lay on the grass, staring at stars we couldn't see through light pollution, trying to figure out how to build lives that made sense.

"I'm scared," Ethan admitted.

"Me too."

"Not just of failing. Of losing us. Of being so overwhelmed that we drift apart without meaning to."

"We won't drift."

"How do you know?"

"Because we're choosing not to. Every day. On purpose."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

His phone buzzed. Email notification.

He checked it and went pale.

"What?"

"Email from my father."

"Robert? He hasn't contacted you in months."

"Subject line: 'We need to talk.'" Ethan showed me the preview:

*Ethan,*

*I've heard about the Detroit situation. I know you're at MIT. I know you think you're making the right choice. We need to talk before you make more mistakes.*

*Your father*

"He doesn't have the right to contact you," I said.

"I'm emancipated, not dead. He can send emails."

"Are you going to respond?"

"I don't know. Maybe?" He stared at the message. "What if he's right? What if I am making mistakes?"

"Then they're your mistakes to make."

"That's not comforting."

"It's honest."

**SEASON CLIFFHANGER**

That night, I couldn't sleep.

Too many decisions. Too many pressures. Too many unknowns.

At 2 AM, I texted Ethan: *You awake?*

*Can't sleep. You?*

*Same. Thinking about everything.*

*National team match?*

*And academics. And whether I can do both. You?*

*Hockey tryout tomorrow. And Robert's email. And whether I'm smart enough for this place.*

*We're a mess.*

*Complete disaster.*

*But we're here.*

*We're here.*

I lay in the dark, listening to Maya breathe steadily in sleep, trying to imagine how to survive the next four years.

Tomorrow, Ethan had varsity hockey tryouts. I had to decide about national team. We both had problem sets due, classes to attend, a relationship to maintain.

We'd survived Robert's control. We'd survived emancipation. We'd survived choosing ourselves over easy paths.

Could we survive success? Could we handle having what we wanted and still maintaining who we were?

I didn't know.

Nobody knew.

That was the terrifying beauty of it.

**FINAL SCENE**

Friday morning, August 25th. One week exactly since we'd arrived at MIT.

I walked to calculus carrying the weight of every decision I hadn't made yet.

Ethan slid into the seat next to me, looking equally exhausted.

"Did you decide?" I asked. "About hockey?"

"I'm trying out today. You?"

"Still thinking about national team."

Professor Chen started lecturing. We took notes frantically, trying to keep up with concepts that built on concepts that referenced theories we barely understood.

At the end of class: "First exam in two weeks. Covers everything we've done so far plus next week's material. Average pass rate is 65%. Study accordingly."

Students filed out looking shell-shocked.

In the hallway, Ethan's phone rang. He looked at it and froze.

"It's Robert."

"Don't answer it."

"I have to. Eventually. He's not going away."

"Not today. Today you have hockey tryouts and I have a badminton decision and we both have eight hours of homework."

"When then?"

"I don't know. But not today."

He declined the call. Immediately, a voicemail notification appeared.

"He's persistent," Ethan said.

"He's controlling. Don't let him back in."

We walked across campus toward our respective afternoon classes, both carrying more weight than any eighteen-year-old should have to carry.

At the split where he went toward the chemistry building and I went toward the engineering lab, we paused.

"Whatever we decide," Ethan said, "we decide together, right? We tell each other, we're honest, we figure it out together?"

"Together," I agreed.

"Even if it's hard?"

"Especially if it's hard."

He kissed me quickly—we had three minutes to get to class.

"See you at dinner?"

"If we survive until dinner."

"We'll survive."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

I watched him walk away toward chemistry, then headed to my own class.

My phone buzzed. Email from the badminton coach:

*Sophia - need your answer by Monday about national team exhibition. This is a career opportunity. Don't miss it.*

Another email from my calculus TA:

*Office hours today 4-6 PM if you need help. First exam is going to be brutal. Prepare accordingly.*

Another from Maya:

*Study group tonight at 8? We're all dying. Dying together is better than dying alone.*

I responded to Maya: *I'll be there.*

Left the other emails unanswered. Decisions for later.

Right now, I had engineering class, then physics lab, then somehow squeezing in eight hours of homework before midnight.

Right now, I had MIT.

And Ethan.

And choices I didn't know how to make.

And a future I couldn't see clearly.

And Robert lurking in the background, still trying to control from a distance.

And opportunities pulling us in different directions.

And the terrifying realization that fighting to be together was only the beginning.

Now we had to figure out how to stay together.

While being successful.

While being ourselves.

While surviving MIT.

While maintaining everything we'd fought for.

Could we do it?

I didn't know.

But I was going to try.

We both were.

Together.
