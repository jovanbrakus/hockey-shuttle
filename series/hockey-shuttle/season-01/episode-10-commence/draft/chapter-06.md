# Chapter 6: New Beginnings

The flight from Winnipeg to Boston took four hours, but it felt like crossing into a different universe.

Ethan and I sat together—middle and window seats, our parents scattered throughout the plane. Our entire lives packed into checked luggage underneath us. Everything we owned, everything we'd need to start over, compressed into suitcases and carry-ons.

"What if we hate it?" Ethan asked as we flew over the Great Lakes.

"Then we transfer."

"What if we're not smart enough?"

"Then we study harder."

"What if we don't fit in?"

"Then we find people who fit with us." I took his hand. "Stop catastrophizing. We're going to be fine."

"You don't know that."

"I know we've survived everything thrown at us so far. MIT is just the next challenge."

He squeezed my hand. "Together?"

"Always together."

We landed at Logan Airport at 2:30 PM Eastern time. August in Boston was humid and hot—nothing like Winnipeg's dry prairie summer. The air felt thick, foreign, like we'd stepped into someone else's life.

Caroline had flown in separately and was already waiting at baggage claim. My parents appeared with luggage carts, looking both excited and sad.

"This is really happening," Mom said, her voice catching.

"This is really happening," I confirmed, and the weight of those words settled in my chest.

We loaded everything into two rental cars and drove toward Cambridge.

---

The first view of MIT stole every thought from my head.

Classical buildings stood beside modern glass and steel. The Great Dome rose against the blue sky like something from a dream—except this wasn't a dream. This was real. This was happening.

This was *ours*.

"We go here," Ethan said, his voice barely above a whisper.

My throat was too tight to respond. I could only stare at students everywhere—moving boxes, laughing with families, existing in this space like they belonged. Like we were supposed to belong.

"We actually made it," I finally managed.

Ethan's hand found mine. His palm was sweating. Or maybe that was mine. "What did we just do?"

"Got everything we wanted."

"That's what terrifies me."

The car pulled up to Next House—my dorm on the west side of campus. Modern building, good location, co-ed by floor. The place that would be home for the next year, shared with a stranger whose name I knew but whose existence suddenly felt overwhelming.

What if she hated me? What if I couldn't sleep with someone else in the room? What if everything about this was a mistake we couldn't take back?

We unloaded my things where dozens of other families were doing the same thing. Chaos everywhere—parents crying, students hugging, RAs with clipboards directing traffic like they'd done this a hundred times before.

A girl appeared at my elbow. Black, athletic build, warm smile, already wearing MIT gear like she'd been born in it.

"Sophia Liu?"

I turned. "Yeah?"

"I'm Maya Williams. Your roommate." She pulled me into a hug like we'd been friends for years. "I've been stalking your Instagram. National badminton champion? That's so cool."

"Uh, thanks?"

"Come on, let's get you moved in. Fourth floor, east corner. Great view." She grabbed one of my bags like it weighed nothing. "Fair warning: I'm very organized and kind of loud. If that's going to drive you crazy, tell me now so we can work on it."

I liked her immediately, which somehow made everything more terrifying. What if I screwed this up?

---

My room was small but functional—two beds, two desks, two dressers, one window overlooking campus. Maya had already decorated her side with photos and posters and strings of lights that made it feel lived-in and warm.

"I got here yesterday," she explained. "Couldn't wait. My parents drove from San Diego, and we did the full tourist thing in Boston first."

As we unpacked, Ethan texted: *Getting settled. Room is tiny. Roommate seems cool but quiet. How's yours?*

I responded: *Opposite problem. Roommate is wonderful and extremely not quiet. Fourth floor, great view. Come by later?*

*After I unpack. Parents are emotional. Send help.*

Maya noticed me smiling at my phone. "The boyfriend?"

"The boyfriend."

"The one who turned down the NHL?"

"Does everyone know that story?"

"I googled both of you when I got the roommate assignment. I'm thorough." She hung up more clothes with practiced efficiency. "So is he actually as smart as his transcript suggests, or is that just good grades?"

"Actually that smart. Annoyingly smart, sometimes."

"Perfect. I hate dating stupid people. Too much explaining."

I laughed, and some of the tension in my chest loosened. Maybe this would be okay. Maybe we could actually do this.

It took three hours to unpack and organize. My parents helped, Caroline stopped by with Ethan to say hello, and gradually my half of the room transformed into something that looked like mine.

Photos on the wall: me and Ethan at prom, my family, my badminton team, Caroline and my parents at graduation. Evidence of where I'd come from, tacked to the walls of where I was going.

MIT sweatshirt hung on the closet door—the one my parents had given us at graduation dinner.

Badminton rackets in the corner—three of them, backup strings, a full kit.

This was home now. This small room with a stranger who was becoming a friend, in a building full of people I didn't know yet, on a campus that felt both enormous and intimate and completely impossible.

"We actually made it," I whispered to myself.

Maya looked up. "What?"

"Nothing. Just—we're really here."

"Best decision you'll ever make," she said confidently. "MIT changes your life. You'll see."

That's what I was afraid of.

---

At 6 PM, Maya and I headed to the dining hall for the first-year welcome dinner.

The dining hall was packed—700+ freshmen trying to find seats, meeting roommates and hallmates, forming the first social connections that would define the next four years. The noise was overwhelming. The crowd was suffocating. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing except me.

I found Ethan in the crowd. He looked as overwhelmed as I felt.

"Sophie, this is Jay Patterson. Jay, Sophia Liu."

Jay nodded—quiet Asian guy with kind eyes. "The badminton player. Ethan mentioned."

"That's me. You're computer science?"

"AI specialization. You're mechanical engineering?"

"That's the plan."

We sat together—me, Ethan, Maya, Jay, and a few other students from our dorms. The conversation flowed: where we were from, what we were studying, why we chose MIT. Normal college questions, except nothing about this felt normal.

"I'm from California," Maya said. "Wanted to get far away from home, prove I could survive east coast weather."

"I'm from Texas," Jay added. "Wanted the best computer science program in the country."

"Canada," Ethan said. "We both are. Winnipeg."

"And you turned down a professional hockey contract to be here," another student—Rachel from our floor—said. "That story is everywhere."

Ethan's face went tight. "It's really not that interesting."

"You turned down millions of dollars. That's interesting."

"I chose education over money. Lots of people do that."

"Not at eighteen with a guaranteed contract."

I could feel Ethan shutting down—the attention, the judgment, the constant reminder that his choice would define him here before anyone knew his name.

"He chose what he wanted instead of what people expected," I said firmly. "That's the whole story. Can we talk about something else?"

Rachel backed off. The conversation shifted. But the damage was done.

After dinner, we walked across campus toward Killian Court—the great lawn in front of the dome where other students were scattered on grass and benches, exploring their new home.

"I'm going to be that guy forever," Ethan said quietly. "The hockey player who said no. That's all anyone's going to know about me."

"Until they actually know you."

"That's not what they see."

"Not yet. But they will."

We found a bench near the dome. Other students laughed in the distance. Someone played guitar badly. Normal college sounds for an abnormal situation.

"I'm terrified," Ethan admitted.

"Of what?"

"Everything. Classes starting Monday. The workload. Whether I'm actually smart enough for this place." He looked at the dome, lit up against the darkening sky. "What if I made the wrong choice?"

"Then you made it honestly, and you'll adjust accordingly." I leaned against him. "But you didn't make the wrong choice. You made the brave choice."

"Brave feels like stupid right now."

"They're often the same thing."

We sat in silence as the sky darkened and lights came on across campus. The air was warm. The moment was perfect. And I was absolutely terrified that we couldn't keep this.

"We're really here," I said.

"We're really here."

---

Over the next three days, orientation consumed us.

Academic advising sessions where we finalized fall schedules. Campus tours showing us buildings we'd spend the next four years in. Student activities fair with 200+ clubs competing for attention.

I stopped by the badminton club table. The president—a junior named Alex—recognized me immediately.

"You're the national champion. From Canada, right?"

"That's me."

"We'd love to have you. Practice three times a week, matches on weekends, very competitive but also fun." He handed me a flyer. "First practice is next week. You should come."

I took the flyer, filed it away mentally. Badminton three times a week. MIT academics full-time. Relationship with Ethan. Social life. Sleep.

Something would have to give. I just didn't know what yet.

Ethan stopped by the club hockey table. The team captain—a senior named Mike—also recognized him.

"You're the kid who turned down Detroit."

"That's me."

"Heard you're pretty good. Want to try out for varsity?"

Ethan blinked. "I thought this was club hockey."

"This table is club. But I also captain varsity. We could use a talented center." Mike pulled out a different flyer. "Tryouts are next week. Much bigger time commitment than club—we practice five times a week, travel for games. But we compete at a high level."

"I chose MIT to focus on academics."

"You can do both. Lots of guys do." Mike shrugged. "Think about it. Tryouts are Wednesday at 6 PM."

After we left the activities fair, Ethan looked shell-shocked.

"He wants me to try out for varsity."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know. That's not why I came here."

"But you love hockey."

"I love hockey without pressure. Varsity hockey at MIT is probably still pressure."

"Or it's challenging yourself while staying in the sport you love." I adjusted the stack of flyers I'd collected. "You don't have to decide today. Just think about it."

---

On August 18th, we had our first official dorm floor meeting.

Next House 4th floor had twenty students—mix of genders, majors, backgrounds. Our RA—a senior named Chris—welcomed us and laid down ground rules.

"You're all adults now. I'm not here to parent you. But I am here if you need help, advice, or someone to talk to." He looked around the circle. "MIT is hard. Really hard. Some of you will struggle. That's normal. What's not normal is suffering alone. If you're drowning, tell someone."

His words hung in the air. Several students shifted uncomfortably.

After the official meeting, the floor gathered in the common room for informal introductions. Maya immediately took charge, getting everyone to share names, majors, and "one weird fact about yourself."

"I'm Maya Williams, mechanical engineering, and I can juggle while riding a unicycle."

"I'm Rachel Kim, biology, and I've never eaten a vegetable."

"I'm Sophia Liu, mechanical engineering, and I won a national badminton championship using a racket I bought at a garage sale."

Laughter around the circle.

When it was done, Maya pulled me aside. "We're going to have a good year."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. This floor has good energy. I can tell."

That night, Ethan and I met at Killian Court again—our spot, apparently.

"How's your floor?" I asked.

"Quiet. Lots of engineers and computer science people who seem more comfortable with computers than humans." He smiled. "Jay is cool though. We're figuring each other out."

"Maya is wonderful and exhausting in equal measure."

"That tracks."

We lay on the grass looking at stars that were barely visible through Boston light pollution.

"Classes start Monday," I said.

"Four days. Then it's real."

"It's already real."

"You know what I mean. Then we find out if we're actually smart enough for this place."

"We are."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I have to believe it." I turned to face him. "If I stop believing it, I'll panic. And if I panic, I can't do this."

He was quiet for a long time. "What if we can't do this?"

"Then we'll fail together and figure out what comes next."

"That's supposed to be comforting?"

"It's supposed to be honest."

His phone rang. Unknown number. He ignored it.

It immediately rang again. Same number.

"You should answer that," I said.

He did, reluctantly. "Hello?"

His face went white.

"This is Ethan... Yes, sir... I—what?... But I'm enrolled... I understand... Can you hold on?"

He pulled the phone away, looked at me with an expression I couldn't read.

"It's Jim Morrison. The Detroit scout."

My stomach dropped.

"What does he want?"

"Their starting center tore his ACL yesterday. They have an emergency roster spot." He swallowed hard. "They want me. Now. Training camp starts September 1st."

---

**THE CALL**

Ethan walked away from me to finish the conversation. I sat on the grass, watching him pace, trying to read his body language from fifty feet away.

He talked for fifteen minutes. Then hung up. Stood very still for a moment.

Then walked back.

"They're offering $3.2 million signing bonus," he said numbly. "Emergency call-up. Guaranteed roster spot for the season. Training camp starts in two weeks."

"Classes start in four days."

"I know."

"You just got here. We just got here."

"I know."

"What did you tell them?"

"That I needed to think about it. That I'd call back in 48 hours." He sat down next to me, ran his hands through his hair. "Sophie, this is—"

"Enormous. I know."

"I thought the door was closed. I chose MIT. I moved on."

"And now the door opened again."

"Everything's different now. They're desperate. They need immediate help. I'd actually play, not sit on the bench for a year."

"But you'd miss MIT."

"Maybe just this semester. I could defer until January, play the first half of the season—"

"MIT doesn't work that way. You know that."

He did know that. We both did.

If he left for Detroit now, MIT was gone. Maybe he could reapply next year, but there was no guarantee. And even if he got back in, I'd be a year ahead. We wouldn't be doing this together anymore.

This wasn't a small choice. This was everything we'd fought for versus everything he'd trained for his entire life.

"What do you want to do?" I asked.

"I don't know." He looked at me helplessly. "Three months ago I knew exactly what I wanted. Now I'm here and the NHL is calling again and I—I don't know."

"Do you want to go?"

"Part of me does. The part that's been playing hockey since age four. The part that dreams about professional competition." He swallowed hard. "But part of me wants to stay. The part that chose education. The part that chose you."

"Don't choose because of me."

"You're part of the decision. You're part of everything."

The night air was warm but I felt cold. This was happening. Again. We'd barely started and already the universe was testing whether we could actually do this.

"If you go," I said carefully, "we're done. You know that, right?"

He looked at me sharply. "What?"

"If you go to Detroit, we're done. You're there, I'm here. Long distance at eighteen while you're playing 82 games a season? That's not sustainable. We'd try for a few months and then slowly drift apart and eventually one of us would end it and we'd both pretend it was mutual."

"Sophie—"

"I'm not saying it to pressure you. I'm saying it because it's true. If you go, you lose me. That's part of the equation." I met his eyes. "So decide if it's worth it. If the NHL is worth losing this. Because I need to know if what we have is actually real or just convenient because we're both at MIT."

He looked stricken. "You think this is just convenient?"

"I think when faced with millions of dollars and your dream career, I need to know if I'm actually enough to make you stay."

"That's not fair."

"None of this is fair."

We sat in silence. Around us, other students laughed and lived and existed in their normal orientation week. Meanwhile, our entire future was cracking apart.

"I need to think," Ethan said finally. "Can I—I need to be alone for a bit. Process this."

"Of course."

"I'm not leaving you. I'm just—"

"I know. Go. Think. We'll talk tomorrow."

He kissed me—quick and desperate and terrified—then walked away toward his dorm.

I sat alone on the grass as the sky darkened and my phone buzzed with messages from Maya asking where I was. I ignored them. I couldn't be social right now. I couldn't pretend this was fine.

We'd made it. We'd fought for months to get here. We'd chosen MIT over everything else.

And now, four days before classes started, I might lose him anyway.

---

**AUGUST 19TH - DECISION EVE**

I barely slept. At 7 AM, Ethan texted: *Can we talk?*

We met at a coffee shop off campus—neutral territory, away from students who might recognize us.

He looked like he hadn't slept at all. Dark circles under his eyes. Hair uncombed. The Ethan who always looked put-together completely undone.

"I spent all night thinking," he said.

"And?"

"And I keep coming back to the same question: am I choosing MIT because I want it, or because I'm afraid of disappointing you?"

"What's your answer?"

"I don't know. Three months ago when I first chose, it was clear. I wanted education, growth, time to develop. But now I'm here and it's overwhelming and the NHL is offering everything I trained for and I—" He stopped. "What if I made the wrong choice in June?"

"Then you adjust. Make a different choice now."

"You'd be okay with that?"

"No. I'd be devastated." I met his eyes. "But I'd rather you choose honestly than stay because you think you owe me something."

"I don't think I owe you. I just—I don't want to lose you."

"You won't lose me by choosing what you want. You'll lose me by choosing something you don't want and resenting me for it later."

He leaned back, exhausted. "If I go to Detroit, we're done. If I stay at MIT because of you and it's the wrong choice, we're also done eventually. Either way, I might lose you."

"So choose based on what you want, not based on me."

"You're part of what I want."

"Then choose based on which version of your life you actually want to live."

The coffee shop was filling with students—mostly upperclassmen, some we'd met during orientation. Normal college kids getting coffee before normal college days.

We were anything but normal.

"Can I tell you what I think?" I said carefully.

"Please."

"I think you're panicking. I think MIT is overwhelming and scary and the NHL is familiar. You know you're good at hockey. You don't know if you're good at MIT-level academics yet. So the NHL feels safer even though it's actually giving up the future you said you wanted."

"So you think I should stay."

"I think you should ask yourself which choice you're making because you want to, and which you're making because you're afraid."

He closed his eyes. "I hate that question."

"I know. But it's the right question."

We sat in silence. His coffee went cold. Mine too.

Finally, Ethan pulled out his phone. "I'm going to call my mom."

He stepped outside. I watched through the window as he paced and talked, hands gesturing, clearly emotional. At one point he stopped walking and just stood there, phone pressed to his ear, completely still.

He came back in ten minutes later.

"What did she say?"

"She asked me if I'd be calling Jim Morrison if classes hadn't started yet. If I'd be reconsidering if MIT wasn't currently terrifying."

"What did you tell her?"

"That I didn't know. Maybe?" He sat down. "She said that was my answer. That if I'm only running to the NHL because MIT is scary, I'll regret it."

"Do you agree?"

"I think I'm terrified of failing here. I think the NHL seems easier because I know I'm good at hockey. But I don't know if I'm good at MIT-level academics."

"Nobody knows that until they try."

"What if I try and fail?"

"Then you try again. Or you transfer. Or you adjust expectations." I squeezed his hand across the table. "But running away before you even start doesn't answer the question."

He was quiet for a long time.

"I'm staying," he said finally.

"Are you sure?"

"No. But I'm sure that leaving now would be running away from fear, not running toward something I actually want." He looked at me. "I chose MIT in June when I had time to think clearly. I'm trusting that version of myself."

"Okay."

"Okay? That's it?"

"What do you want me to say? I'm relieved you're staying, terrified you'll resent me for it, and proud that you're facing the fear instead of avoiding it." I managed a smile. "Welcome to complicated feelings."

"I need to call Jim."

"Do it now. Before you second-guess yourself."

He did. Right there in the coffee shop, on speaker so I could hear.

"Jim, it's Ethan Mercer."

"Ethan. Have you made a decision?"

"I have. Thank you for the opportunity—genuinely, thank you. But I'm staying at MIT."

Silence on the other end.

"You're sure this time?" Jim asked carefully.

"I'm sure. MIT is where I'm supposed to be right now. Hockey will always be there in some form. But this opportunity—being here, starting college, building a different kind of life—this only happens once."

"Alright. I respect that." Jim sighed. "For the record, I think you're making the right choice. But this really is the last time, Ethan. After this, the door closes."

"I understand."

"Good luck, kid. You're going to need it."

After he hung up, Ethan set his phone down very carefully.

"It's done."

"How do you feel?"

"Terrified. Relieved. Like I might throw up."

"That's appropriate."

"Did I just make a massive mistake?"

"Ask me in four years."

We left the coffee shop holding hands, walking back toward campus in the August heat. Neither of us spoke for several blocks.

Finally, Ethan stopped walking. Turned to face me. "I need you to know something."

"What?"

"I didn't stay just for you. I stayed for me too. For the future I said I wanted." He touched my face. "But you're part of why that future matters. You're part of why any of this matters."

I kissed him. Right there on the Cambridge sidewalk with students passing by and the morning sun beating down. I kissed him like we'd just made a choice that would define our lives.

Because we had.

---

**AUGUST 20TH - LAST DAY BEFORE CLASSES**

Orientation week ended with a massive welcome ceremony in Killian Court—all 1,100 freshmen gathered on the lawn while the president welcomed us and upper-level students performed ridiculous traditions.

"You're MIT now," the president said. "That means you're expected to do impossible things. To push boundaries. To fail and try again. To build and break and rebuild better."

I looked at Ethan. He looked at me.

We'd already been doing that for months.

"Some of you will struggle this year," the president continued. "That's normal. What matters is what you do when you struggle. Do you give up, or do you ask for help? Do you quit, or do you adapt?"

The words settled over the crowd like a challenge.

That night, our floor had one last orientation event—an informal gathering in the common room to celebrate before classes started.

Someone brought cookies. Someone else brought music. We sat around talking about summer, about fears, about excitement.

"What are you most nervous about?" Rachel asked the group.

"Failing physics," one student said.

"Not making friends," another admitted.

"Not being smart enough," Jay said quietly. Ethan nodded agreement.

When it got to me, I said: "Balancing everything. Academics, athletics, relationship, sleep. Something's going to have to give, and I don't know what."

"Sleep," Maya said immediately. "Sleep is always what gives."

"Encouraging."

"Honest."

At 11 PM, the gathering broke up. Students drifted to their rooms to prepare for tomorrow.

Ethan walked me to my door.

"Last night before classes start," he said.

"Tomorrow it's real."

"Tomorrow we find out if we can actually do this."

He kissed me goodnight—soft and slow and full of unspoken fears. When he pulled away, his hand lingered on my waist.

"I'm scared," he admitted quietly.

"Me too."

"But we're doing it anyway."

"Together."

"Together," he echoed.

After he left, I stood in the hallway for a moment, trying to convince myself we could actually survive what was coming.

---

**AUGUST 21ST - FIRST DAY**

My alarm went off at 7 AM.

First class: Calculus II, 9 AM, in a massive lecture hall across campus.

I dressed carefully—nothing too formal, nothing too casual, trying to look like I belonged at MIT even though I felt like an imposter who'd somehow tricked the admissions committee.

Maya was already awake, somehow energetic despite the early hour.

"First day! This is going to be amazing!"

"This is going to be terrifying."

"Same thing!"

We walked to class together—along with half our floor, all heading to various first-day classes. The campus was alive with nervous energy. Freshmen everywhere clutching schedules and campus maps, trying to look confident.

The lecture hall was enormous. Two hundred seats arranged in ascending rows, a massive screen at the front, chalkboards covering the walls. I'd never had a class with more than thirty students before.

I found a seat near the middle. Ethan appeared a few minutes later, sliding into the seat next to me.

"Found you."

"We have this class together. Of course you found me."

"Moral support though."

At 8:59—exactly on time—the professor walked in carrying a briefcase and an aura of intense intelligence. She wrote on the board: **18.02 - MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS**

"Good morning. I'm Professor Chen. Welcome to Calculus II." She turned to face us. "This course has a 40% drop rate. Look to your left. Look to your right. Statistically, one of you won't be here by midterms."

Students looked around nervously. I felt Ethan tense beside me.

The student to my left was a girl who looked terrified. The student to my right was Ethan. One of us wouldn't make it.

"If you're not prepared to work harder than you've ever worked, leave now. This course demands precision, dedication, and the ability to think in multiple dimensions simultaneously."

No one left. We were all too terrified to move.

"Good. Let's begin."

For the next ninety minutes, Professor Chen taught at a pace that made high school calculus look like kindergarten math. Concepts built on concepts, equations filled the board faster than I could copy them. My hand cramped from writing. My brain hurt from trying to keep up.

Around me, students frantically took notes. Some gave up after thirty minutes and just listened, knowing they'd lost the thread. Others, like me, kept writing desperately, hoping we could make sense of it later.

Ethan looked shell-shocked.

When class ended, students filed out looking dazed. Several were already checking the add/drop deadline.

"That was intense," I said, understating it massively.

"That was impossible. There's no way we can keep up with that pace for an entire semester."

"We'll figure it out."

"How are you so calm?"

"I'm not calm. I'm just good at pretending."

We had a break before our next classes—Physics I at 1 PM for me, Chemistry for him at 2 PM.

We found a bench outside, sitting in the August heat, processing what we'd just experienced.

"First class at MIT," Ethan said.

"First of many."

"I already have three hours of homework due Wednesday."

"Same. Plus reading for engineering seminar tomorrow."

Around us, other students were having similar realizations. This wasn't high school anymore. This was MIT, where being the smartest kid in your hometown meant absolutely nothing.

"We can do this," I said, more to myself than to him.

"Can we?"

"We got in. We belong here."

"Getting in and surviving are different things."

My phone buzzed. Email from Professor Chen:

*First problem set posted online. Due Wednesday, 5 PM. Start early. It's harder than it looks.*

I showed Ethan. He checked his own phone and groaned.

"She's not kidding. This problem set has fifteen questions and I don't understand the first one."

"We'll figure it out. Office hours, study groups, each other."

"What if that's not enough?"

I didn't have an answer for that.

The rest of the day was a blur—Physics lecture where the professor also warned us about high drop rates, engineering introduction seminar where we learned about project-based learning and all-nighters, lab section where I struggled to remember basic concepts.

By 6 PM, I was intellectually exhausted in a way I'd never experienced before. My brain felt like mush. My confidence was shattered. And I still had hours of homework ahead of me.

I dragged myself to the badminton practice I'd signed up for.

The gymnasium was already full of players warming up. Alex saw me and waved.

"Sophia! Ready to play?"

"Ready to collapse, but sure."

We played for ninety minutes—drills, rally practice, strategy sessions. Here, finally, I was good. Here I understood. Physical excellence, technique, competition—this made sense in a way calculus didn't.

After practice, Alex pulled me aside.

"You're really good. Like, legitimately elite good."

"Thanks."

"We compete at a high level. Regional tournaments, national club championships. If you commit, we could win a lot."

"How much commitment?"

"Three practices a week, tournaments every other weekend during season, extra training on off days if you want to stay sharp."

I calculated quickly: three practices, tournaments, studying, classes, Ethan, sleep.

The math didn't work.

"Can I think about it?"

"Sure. But we'd love to have you at that level."

I walked back to my dorm as the sun set, trying to figure out how to fit twenty-seven hours of commitments into a twenty-four-hour day.

Ethan texted: *How was badminton?*

*Intense. Good. How was your evening?*

*Studied for three hours. Still have four more to go. This is unsustainable.*

*We've been here for one day.*

*Exactly. If this is day one, what is day thirty going to look like?*

I didn't respond because I didn't have an answer.

When I got back to my room, Maya was at her desk surrounded by textbooks, already deep into problem sets.

"How was badminton?"

"They want me to compete at a high level. Big time commitment."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know how to fit it in."

"Welcome to MIT. Where time management is a required skill they don't actually teach you." She highlighted something in her textbook. "You'll figure it out. We all do. Or we all fail together."

"That's comforting."

"It's honest."

I sat at my desk, pulled out my calculus homework. Fifteen problems. The first one alone took me twenty minutes and I still wasn't sure I got it right.

It was 8 PM. I'd been awake for thirteen hours. I had at least five more hours of work ahead of me.

This was MIT.

This was what we'd chosen.

**AUGUST 22ND - THE SECOND OFFER**

I woke to my phone ringing.

Ethan's name on the screen. 6:47 AM.

"It's not even 7 AM. Why are you calling?"

"Jim Morrison called again." His voice was shaking.

I sat up immediately, suddenly wide awake. "What?"

"Same injury situation. They're even more desperate now. They bumped the offer to $3.5 million signing bonus. Guaranteed starting position. Training camp starts September 1st."

My stomach dropped. "You told him no two days ago."

"I know. But he said the GM wants to talk to me directly. Said the team is in crisis mode. Said if I don't say yes now, someone else will and I'll regret it forever."

"Ethan—"

"Sophie, classes yesterday were impossible. The calculus homework is destroying me. I got a 62% on the first problem set that was supposed to be 'easy.'" His voice cracked. "And the NHL is right there offering money and a path I already understand and I—what if I'm making a huge mistake being here?"

My chest felt tight. "You've been here for two days."

"Two days that have shown me I might not be smart enough for this place. What if I'm destroying my NHL career just to fail out of MIT? What if I'm not good enough for either path?"

"Come to my room. We need to talk face to face."

He showed up fifteen minutes later, looking like he hadn't slept. Hair disheveled, eyes wild, the Ethan who was always in control completely falling apart.

Maya took one look at us and grabbed her backpack. "I'm going to study in the library. Take your time."

After she left, Ethan collapsed on my bed.

"Tell me what to do," he said desperately.

"I can't do that."

"Yes, you can. Tell me to stay. Tell me MIT is worth it. Tell me I'm not going to fail here. Tell me—"

"I can't make this decision for you. That's the whole point." I sat next to him. "If you want to go to Detroit, go. If you want to stay at MIT, stay. But decide for the right reasons."

"What are the right reasons?"

"Choosing what you want, not what you're afraid of."

He was quiet for a long time, staring at my ceiling.

"I'm afraid of failing here. But I'm also afraid of regretting not trying." He looked at me. "Which fear wins?"

"The one you can live with."

"That's not helpful."

"It's honest."

His phone rang. Unknown number. Detroit area code.

"That's the GM," Ethan said, staring at it.

"Are you going to answer?"

"I don't know."

The phone kept ringing. I watched him watch it, paralyzed by indecision.

Finally, it went to voicemail.

Immediately, a text appeared: *This is Tom Wilson, Detroit Red Wings GM. I'd like to speak with you directly about our offer. We're prepared to increase the signing bonus to $4 million. Please call me at your earliest convenience.*

Ethan showed me the text.

Four million dollars.

I felt sick.

"He's serious," I said.

"They're desperate. Injury, thin roster, season starting soon. They need someone who can play immediately." He read the text again. "Four million dollars, Sophie. That's life-changing money."

"So is an MIT degree."

"But what if I can't earn the degree? What if I wash out after one semester with $80,000 in debt and no NHL career because I waited too long?"

"Then you'll have tried. You'll know."

"That's not comforting when I'm staring at four million guaranteed dollars."

He stood up, paced my small room like a caged animal. "I need to think. I need—can I just sit here for a bit? Not talk, just exist?"

"Of course."

So we sat in silence. Me at my desk pretending to do homework but actually watching him. Him on my bed staring at the ceiling, phone in his hand, wrestling with a choice that could define his entire life.

An hour passed.

Finally, Ethan pulled out his phone.

"I'm calling the GM."

My heart stopped. "Ethan—"

"I need to talk to him. Hear what he has to say. Make an informed decision." He put it on speaker. "Is that okay?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

He dialed.

"Mr. Wilson, this is Ethan Mercer returning your call."

"Ethan! Thanks for calling back." Professional voice, warm but businesslike. "I wanted to speak with you directly about our offer. I know you've chosen MIT, and I respect that. But our situation is unique. We have an immediate need, and you're our first choice to fill it."

"I appreciate that, sir."

"Let me be very clear about what we're offering: $4 million signing bonus—that's up from our previous offer. Guaranteed roster spot, no bench time. You'd be playing twenty minutes a night from day one. This is not a development opportunity. This is a professional career starting right now."

Ethan's hand was shaking. I could see him doing the math—$4 million versus student debt, NHL career versus academic struggle, certainty versus unknown.

"I understand," Ethan said carefully.

"And I know you're at MIT. I know you've started classes. But Ethan, MIT will still be there next year. This opportunity won't. We need you now. By next August, we'll have filled this position with someone else and the door will be permanently closed."

Wilson paused to let that sink in.

"Can I ask what's holding you back?" Wilson continued. "Because from where I'm sitting, you're choosing massive debt and academic pressure over financial security and doing what you love for a living."

Ethan looked at me. I kept my face neutral even though my heart was breaking.

"I chose MIT because I wanted to prove I'm more than just a hockey player," Ethan said slowly. "Because I wanted education and growth and time to figure out who I am without hockey consuming everything. The NHL is incredible, but it's also all-consuming. If I go now, I'll never know who I could have been outside of hockey."

"You'd be a professional athlete living your dream."

"I've been living someone else's dream my entire life. MIT is the first thing I've chosen entirely for myself."

"So you're saying no."

Long pause. The longest pause of my life.

I watched Ethan struggle, watched him look at his phone, at me, at the future splitting in two directions.

"Yes, sir," he finally said. "I'm saying no. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for the opportunities. But I'm staying at MIT."

"Four million dollars, Ethan. Guaranteed. That's more money than most people see in a lifetime."

"I know. And I'm grateful. But I'm not most people. I'm someone who needs to know if I'm brave enough to try something hard instead of taking the easy path."

"MIT isn't going to pay you four million dollars."

"No. But it's going to teach me who I am when I'm not being the person everyone expects me to be."

Wilson sighed. "You're absolutely certain."

"I'm terrified and uncertain and convinced I might be making a mistake. But yes, I'm certain. This is my choice."

"This is the last time we'll call, Ethan. After this, the door is closed permanently. Do you understand that?"

"I understand."

"Alright. I respect your decision even if I think you're crazy." Wilson's voice softened slightly. "Good luck at MIT. You're going to need it."

"Thank you, sir."

After he hung up, Ethan sat very still.

"I just turned down four million dollars," he said quietly.

"You chose yourself."

"I'm either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid."

"Probably both."

He lay back on my bed, stared at my ceiling. "My hands are shaking."

"That's normal."

"Is it? Because I feel like I'm going to throw up."

I lay down next to him, our bodies barely fitting on the narrow dorm bed. "You made the right choice."

"How do you know?"

"Because you made it for the right reasons. Because you chose growth over comfort. Because you're braver than you think."

He turned to face me. We were inches apart, sharing the same pillow, breathing the same air.

"If this goes badly—if I fail out of MIT—I'm going to regret this forever."

"Then don't fail out."

"That simple?"

"That simple."

He kissed me. Soft at first, then desperate, like he needed to prove to himself that he'd made the right choice. That I was worth four million dollars. That we were worth the risk.

I kissed him back with everything I had—relief and terror and love and fear all mixed together.

When we finally broke apart, we were both breathing hard.

"I should go," Ethan said. "Before Maya comes back and finds us like this."

"Probably smart."

At the door, he turned back. "I didn't stay just for you."

"I know."

"But you're a big part of why I stayed."

"I know that too."

After he left, I tried to focus on homework. Failed completely. Called my parents instead.

"Sophie?" Mom answered. "Everything okay?"

"Ethan got another NHL offer. Bigger than the first. Four million dollars. He turned it down an hour ago."

Silence.

"Four million?" Dad asked—they'd put me on speaker.

"Four million. Guaranteed. Starting position."

"And he said no?"

"He said no."

"Is he okay?" Mom asked gently.

"I think so. Terrified, but okay."

"Are you okay?"

"I don't know. Part of me is relieved he's staying. Part of me is afraid he'll resent me for being part of why he stayed. Part of me thinks we're both crazy for being at MIT when the world is offering us easier paths."

"That's a lot of parts," Mom said.

"Welcome to being eighteen and making life-altering decisions."

"You're going to be fine," Dad said. "Both of you. You're strong enough to make hard choices and brave enough to live with the consequences."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're our daughter. And stubbornness runs in the family."

**THE DOUBTS**

That night, I couldn't sleep.

At 2 AM, I texted Ethan: *You awake?*

*Can't sleep. Keep thinking about the money.*

*Regrets?*

*Not exactly. More like... what if I'm wrong? What if I just threw away my entire future?*

*You didn't throw it away. You chose a different future.*

*A future where I might fail calculus and have nothing.*

*Or a future where you become something amazing.*

*You have a lot of faith in me.*

*Someone has to.*

*What if I don't deserve it?*

I stared at that message for a long time. Then I got out of bed, threw on clothes, and walked across campus to his dorm.

He answered his door looking surprised. "Sophie? It's 2 AM."

"I know. Let me in."

His roommate Jay was deeply asleep—or pretending to be. We went into the hallway.

"You deserve it," I said. "My faith. Your own faith. All of it."

"You can't know that."

"I know you turned down four million dollars to try something hard. I know you chose growth over comfort. I know you're braver than you think you are." I took his hands. "And I know that even if you fail calculus, even if MIT destroys you, you'll figure out what comes next because that's who you are."

"What if I can't?"

"Then I'll help you. Then your mom will help you. Then you'll help yourself." I squeezed his hands. "But you won't know unless you try. And trying is the whole point."

He pulled me into a hug, holding me like I was the only solid thing in a world that had gone liquid.

"I'm so scared," he whispered.

"Me too."

"But you're still here."

"I'm still here."

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not letting me spiral. For showing up at 2 AM. For believing in me when I don't believe in myself."

"That's what we do. We show up."

We stood in the hallway holding each other while the rest of the dorm slept, two terrified eighteen-year-olds trying to convince ourselves we could survive what we'd chosen.

---

**AUGUST 23RD - WEDNESDAY**

The next day was brutal.

Classes from 9 AM to 3 PM. Homework until 6 PM. Badminton practice at 6:30 PM.

I was running on four hours of sleep. My brain felt like mush. The calculus problem set was destroying me—I'd spent three hours on it the night before and only finished six of fifteen problems.

At badminton practice, Alex pulled me aside again.

"Hey, I need your answer soon about commitment level. We're planning fall tournament schedule."

"Can I get back to you next week?"

"Sure. But think about it seriously. You're good enough to compete nationally. That doesn't happen often."

After practice, I trudged back to my dorm, every muscle aching, my mind spinning with unfinished homework and impossible decisions.

Ethan was waiting outside my building.

"I have news," he said.

"Good news or bad news?"

"Depends on your perspective. The varsity hockey coach called. He wants me to try out Friday. Says he's heard I'm exceptional and thinks I'd be a great addition to the team."

"That's great! You love hockey."

"Hockey five times a week plus games plus travel. On top of MIT academics." He looked exhausted. "I don't know if I can do it."

"Do you want to do it?"

"I want to play hockey. I don't know if I want that much hockey."

We sat on the steps outside my dorm as the sun set.

"We're both facing the same choice," I said. "Commit to our sports at a high level, or focus on academics."

"Can we do both?"

"I don't know. Can we?"

My phone buzzed. Email from Professor Chen: *First problem set scores posted. Class average: 58%. If you scored below 70%, please see me during office hours.*

I checked my score: 73%. Barely above the threshold.

Ethan checked his: 67%.

"I failed," he said quietly.

"You didn't fail. You got 67%."

"At MIT, that's failing. The average is 58% and I'm below 70%." He stared at his phone. "Two days of classes and I'm already struggling. And I'm considering adding varsity hockey?"

"Maybe the hockey would help. Give you balance."

"Or maybe it would destroy me faster."

We sat in silence as other students passed by, laughing and talking like their lives weren't falling apart.

"I don't know how to do this," Ethan admitted. "I don't know how to be good at MIT while also being good at hockey while also being good at us."

"Maybe we're not supposed to be good at everything. Maybe we're supposed to figure out what matters most."

"What if I can't choose?"

"Then you'll struggle until you can."

He leaned against me, exhausted. "I miss when things were simple."

"When was that?"

"Never, I guess."

My phone buzzed again. Text from Maya: *Study group in twenty minutes. Common room. Bring your tears and your textbooks.*

I showed Ethan. "Want to join?"

"I should. I need all the help I can get."

---

**AUGUST 24TH - ROBERT'S RETURN**

Thursday after classes, I was walking back to my dorm when Ethan called.

"Robert emailed me."

I stopped walking. "What?"

"Subject line: 'We need to talk.' I haven't opened it yet."

"Don't."

"I have to. Eventually."

"Not today. Not while you're already struggling."

"When then?"

"I don't know. Maybe never."

"That's not realistic."

"Neither is letting him back into your head when you're barely holding on."

Silence on the other end.

"I'm opening it," Ethan said.

"Ethan, don't—"

"I need to know what he wants."

I heard him typing, then a long pause.

"What does it say?" I asked, dreading the answer.

"'Ethan, I've heard about the Detroit situation. I know you're at MIT. I know you think you're making the right choice. We need to talk before you make more mistakes. Your father.'" Another pause. "He knows about the offers. He knows I'm struggling. How does he know?"

"Maybe he's been tracking you online. Maybe Jim Morrison told someone who told someone. Does it matter?"

"It matters that he's watching. That he's waiting for me to fail so he can say 'I told you so.'"

"Then don't fail."

"That's not helpful."

"It's honest."

"I don't know if I can ignore him."

"You have to. He lost the right to have an opinion when he lost custody. He doesn't get to control you anymore."

"But what if he's right? What if I am making mistakes?"

"Then they're your mistakes to make. Not his."

Ethan was quiet for a long time.

"I'm not going to respond," he finally said. "Not now. Maybe not ever."

"Good."

"But he's in my head now. Wondering if I'm failing. Waiting to be proven right."

"Then prove him wrong."

"How?"

"By surviving. By staying. By refusing to let him have power over you."

After we hung up, I felt sick. Robert was like a shadow that wouldn't disappear, always lurking at the edges, waiting for us to stumble.

---

**AUGUST 25TH - FRIDAY**

Friday morning, one week exactly since we'd arrived at MIT.

I walked to calculus carrying the weight of every decision I hadn't made yet. Badminton commitment. Time management. Whether I could actually survive here.

Ethan slid into the seat next to me, looking equally exhausted.

"Did you decide?" I asked. "About hockey?"

"Tryout is tonight at 6. I'm going. Don't know if I'll commit if they want me, but I'm going to try out."

"Good. You should."

"What about you? Badminton?"

"Still thinking."

Professor Chen started lecturing. We took notes frantically, trying to keep up with concepts that built on concepts that referenced theories we barely understood.

At the end of class: "First exam in two weeks. Covers everything we've done so far plus next week's material. Average pass rate is 65%. Study accordingly."

Students filed out looking shell-shocked.

In the hallway, Ethan's phone rang. He looked at it and went pale.

"It's him."

"Robert?"

"Yeah."

"Don't answer it."

"I have to. Eventually. He's not going away."

"Not today. Today you have classes and hockey tryout and eight hours of homework."

"When then?"

"I don't know. But not today."

He declined the call. Immediately, a voicemail notification appeared.

"He's persistent," Ethan said.

"He's trying to get back in your head. Don't let him."

We walked across campus toward our respective afternoon classes, both carrying more weight than any eighteen-year-old should have to carry.

At the split where he went toward the chemistry building and I went toward the engineering lab, we paused.

"Whatever we decide," Ethan said, "we decide together, right? We tell each other, we're honest, we figure it out together?"

"Together," I agreed.

"Even if it's hard?"

"Especially if it's hard."

He kissed me quickly—we had three minutes to get to class—but the kiss felt desperate, like he was trying to hold onto something solid while everything else was shifting.

"See you at dinner?"

"If we survive until dinner."

"We'll survive."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

I watched him walk away toward chemistry, then headed to my own class.

My phone buzzed. Email from Alex:

*Sophia - need your answer by Monday about national team. This is a career opportunity. Don't miss it because you're scared of commitment.*

I stared at that email. Scared of commitment? Or realistic about my limits?

Another email from the badminton coach:

*The national team exhibition match is October 15-18. Four days. You'd miss classes but this is what you trained for all summer. Say yes.*

Four days during midterm season. Missing lectures, labs, problem sets.

My phone buzzed again. Text from Maya:

*Emergency study session tonight. Everyone's dying. Meet at 8?*

I responded: *I'll be there.*

Then walked to engineering class trying to figure out how to fit twenty-seven hours of commitments into a twenty-four-hour day.

---

**FRIDAY NIGHT - THE MOMENT**

At 9 PM, after Ethan's hockey tryout and my study session, we met at Killian Court.

Our spot. Where we'd sat that first night, terrified and hopeful.

Ethan collapsed on the grass next to me. "I made varsity."

"That's amazing!"

"They want me to commit. Five practices a week, games every weekend, travel to other schools."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know. It's so much time. But I love playing. And it felt good to be good at something again."

"You're good at academics too."

"Am I though? I got a 67% on the first problem set and barely understand what's happening in chemistry."

I lay back on the grass. "I got offered the national team exhibition match. Four days in October. During midterms."

"Are you going to do it?"

"I don't know. It's what I trained for all summer. But missing four days of classes could destroy my grades."

We lay in silence, staring at stars we couldn't see through light pollution.

"We're a mess," Ethan said.

"Complete disaster."

"We've been here one week and we're already drowning."

"One week," I repeated. "Four years to go."

He turned to face me. "What if we can't do this?"

"Then we'll figure out what comes next."

"That's your answer for everything."

"Because it's the truth."

He looked at me for a long moment, and I could see everything in his eyes—fear and love and desperation and determination all mixed together.

"Come here," he said softly.

I moved closer. He pulled me against him, his hand tangling in my hair, his mouth finding mine.

The kiss was different this time. Not quick and reassuring. Not gentle and sweet.

Desperate.

Like he needed to prove we were real. Like he needed something to hold onto while everything else was spinning out of control.

I kissed him back with everything I had—all the fear and uncertainty and need translated into this moment. His hands on my waist. My fingers gripping his shirt. The warm night air and the soft grass and the sound of other students in the distance meaning nothing compared to this.

When we finally broke apart, we were both breathing hard.

"I needed that," he whispered against my hair.

"Me too."

"Everything is chaos. But this—us—this makes sense."

"We make sense."

He pulled me closer, holding me like I might disappear. "What if we can't survive this?"

"Then we won't survive. But we'll try first."

"That's supposed to be comforting?"

"It's supposed to be honest."

We lay tangled together on the grass, holding onto each other while the world demanded impossible choices.

---

**THE CLIFFHANGER**

Sunday night. End of the first week.

I was in my room doing homework when Ethan texted: *Can you come to Killian?*

I found him sitting on our bench, staring at his phone.

"What's wrong?"

He showed me the screen. Robert's voicemail, finally played:

*"Ethan, I know you're struggling. I know MIT is harder than you expected. When you're ready to admit you made a mistake, call me. I can still fix this. There are junior hockey teams that would take you. Paths back to professional hockey. But you have to act soon before you destroy your future completely. Call me. —Dad."*

Ethan looked at me. "What if he's right?"

"He's not."

"But what if he is? What if I'm failing MIT just to prove a point? What if I should have taken the NHL money when I had the chance?"

"You made the right choice."

"Did I though? Because right now it feels like I'm drowning and I don't know how to swim and everyone around me seems fine and I—" His voice cracked. "What if I'm not good enough for this?"

I sat next to him, took his hand. "You are good enough. You're just scared."

"Being scared and being wrong aren't mutually exclusive."

"Neither are being scared and being right."

He was quiet for a long time, staring at the dome lit up against the night sky.

"I have to decide about varsity hockey by tomorrow," he finally said. "And you have to decide about national team. And we both have that calculus exam in two weeks. And Robert is in my head saying I'm going to fail. And I don't know how to do any of this."

"We'll figure it out."

"How?"

"Together."

"What if together isn't enough?"

I didn't have an answer for that.

My phone buzzed. Email from Alex with the subject line: **FINAL REQUEST - National Team Needs Answer Monday**

Ethan's phone buzzed. Email notification. He checked it and went pale.

"The hockey coach needs my answer by tomorrow morning about commitment."

We looked at each other.

One week at MIT. Already drowning. Already facing impossible choices.

Robert trying to get back in Ethan's head. Both of us struggling academically. Both being offered opportunities that would demand everything we had.

"What are we going to do?" Ethan asked.

"I don't know."

"That's not comforting."

"It's honest."

We sat in silence as other students passed by, living their normal college lives while ours felt like it was splitting apart.

"I'm scared," Ethan said quietly.

"Me too."

"Not just of failing classes. Of losing us. Of being pulled in so many directions that we drift apart without meaning to. Of becoming people we don't recognize because we're trying to do everything and losing what matters."

His words hit me like a physical blow because he'd just named exactly what I'd been feeling.

"What if we can survive Robert and emancipation and fighting for our freedom," I said slowly, "but we can't survive success? What if having everything we wanted destroys us more effectively than anyone trying to control us ever could?"

Ethan looked at me. Really looked at me.

"That's the question, isn't it?" he said. "Can we survive success as well as we survived adversity?"

"I don't know."

"Neither do I."

We sat on our bench beneath the dome, holding hands, both exhausted from one week of MIT. Both facing decisions that would define our next four years. Both terrified that we'd fought so hard to be together only to discover that being together wasn't the hard part.

Staying together was.

The night air was warm. Campus was quiet. Somewhere in the distance, someone laughed.

Ethan's phone buzzed again. Another email. He didn't check it.

"Tomorrow I have to decide about hockey," he said.

"Tomorrow I have to decide about national team."

"And we both have eight hours of homework."

"And that calculus exam in two weeks."

"And Robert waiting for me to fail."

"And everything we thought we wanted turning out to be harder than we imagined."

He turned to face me fully, his hand still in mine.

"Can we do this?" he asked.

I looked at him—the boy I'd known since we were kids, the boy who'd chosen me, the boy who was currently falling apart while trying to hold it together.

I looked at the dome lit up against the night sky.

I looked at my phone with its unanswered emails and impossible demands.

"I don't know," I said honestly. "But we're going to try."

"And if we fail?"

"Then we fail. Together."

He kissed me softly. "Together."

"Together," I echoed.

We sat beneath the dome holding each other, two terrified eighteen-year-olds who'd fought so hard to get here.

Who'd survived controlling parents and emancipation and choosing themselves over easier paths.

Who'd made it to MIT against all odds.

And who were now discovering that the fight wasn't over.

It was just beginning.

Because surviving adversity was one thing.

Surviving success—surviving having what you wanted and keeping it—was something else entirely.

And neither of us knew if we were strong enough for that.

But we were going to find out.

---

**[END OF SEASON 1]**

---

**SEASON 2 OPENS WITH:**

Can they survive success as well as they survived adversity?

Can they maintain their relationship when pulled in opposite directions by opportunities they've earned?

Can they stay themselves while becoming who they're meant to be?

Can they keep Robert from regaining control when they're too exhausted to fight?

Can they survive MIT when surviving each other might be the harder challenge?

*Coming in Season 2...*
