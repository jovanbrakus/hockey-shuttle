# Chapter 3: Celebration Season

Prom shopping with Ethan Mercer turned out to be one of the most unexpectedly normal things we'd ever done together.

We went the Saturday after his MIT decision—June 2nd, one week before the dance. Downtown Winnipeg had exactly two formal wear shops, and we hit both of them with the determination of people who'd survived emancipation proceedings and could definitely handle choosing coordinating outfits.

"I have no idea what I'm doing," Ethan admitted as we stood in front of a wall of tuxedos.

"You wear clothes every day. This is just... fancier clothes."

"I wear jeans and hockey jerseys. This is a completely different category of clothing."

The sales associate—a patient man named David who'd clearly seen many terrified teenage boys—stepped in. "What's your date wearing?"

Ethan looked at me helplessly.

"I haven't chosen yet," I said. "I was thinking something blue? Maybe dark blue?"

David's eyes lit up. "Classic. Elegant. Easy to coordinate with." He turned to Ethan. "Black tux, white shirt, blue tie to match her dress. Can't go wrong."

Twenty minutes later, Ethan was standing in front of a mirror in a perfectly fitted tuxedo looking like he'd walked out of a magazine spread. Black jacket, crisp white shirt, the tie would come later once I'd found my dress.

"You clean up nice," I said.

He tugged at the collar. "I feel like an imposter. Like I'm playing dress-up."

"You're literally going to prom. That's exactly what prom is—dress-up for teenagers."

"Fair point." He turned in front of the mirror, examining himself from different angles. "Think anyone will recognize me?"

"Everyone will recognize you. You're the hockey player who turned down the NHL."

He winced. "That's going to be my identity forever, isn't it?"

"At least until we get to MIT and become 'those freshmen from Canada.'"

"I can live with that."

We ordered his tux—pickup on June 6th, the day before prom. Then we headed to the dress shop, where I faced the significantly more complicated task of finding something that felt like me.

"What do you normally wear to formal events?" the sales associate asked.

"Badminton uniforms?"

She laughed. "Okay, let's start with color. You said blue?"

"I look good in blue. And I like darker colors. Not pastels."

She disappeared into the racks, returning with five dresses. "Try these. Let's see what works."

Ethan settled into the waiting area with his phone, texting with Caroline about apartment furniture. I headed to the dressing room.

The first dress was too much—layers and sparkles and a skirt that took up half the room.

The second was too formal—like I was going to a wedding, not a high school dance.

The third was wrong in ways I couldn't articulate—the cut, the fit, the vibe. Just wrong.

The fourth made me look twelve.

The fifth...

The fifth was perfect.

Midnight blue silk that caught the light like water. Halter neck that showed my shoulders—athlete shoulders I'd earned through years of badminton. Fitted bodice that was elegant without being revealing. Flowing skirt that moved when I did, like I was still in motion even standing still.

I stared at myself in the mirror. My hair was a mess, I had no makeup on, I was wearing mismatched socks underneath. But somehow, the dress worked.

"Can I see?" Ethan called from outside.

"No! That's bad luck or something."

"That's weddings. Prom doesn't have those rules."

"I'm making new rules. No peeking until prom night."

The sales associate poked her head in. "Oh honey. That's the one."

"You think?"

"I know." She adjusted the straps slightly. "You look like yourself, just elevated. That's what a good dress does."

I turned in front of the mirror, watching the skirt move. "It's not too much?"

"It's perfect. Trust me."

I did.

We bought the dress—more money than I'd ever spent on clothes, but my parents had given me a budget and told me to find something that made me feel beautiful. This did.

On the drive home, Ethan kept trying to guess what the dress looked like.

"Is it sparkly?"

"No."

"Is it pink?"

"I said blue. Were you not listening?"

"Is it short?"

"Knee length. Stop fishing for information."

"Is it—"

"You'll see it on Thursday when we take pictures. That's in five days. You can wait five days."

He grinned. "I'm good at waiting. I waited eight months to actually date you."

"That was different. That was survival."

"This is anticipation. Equally difficult."

We spent the rest of the week in the strange liminal space of high school ending. Finals were done. Classes were over. Graduation was in three weeks. We were technically still students but practically already gone.

Wednesday afternoon, Maya—my future MIT roommate—video called me.

"I need to know everything about prom," she said without preamble. "We don't do prom this big in California. Like, we have it, but it's not a *thing* the way it seems to be everywhere else."

"It's one dance. Dinner, photos, dancing, after-party. That's it."

"You're going with the hockey player who turned down millions of dollars. It's definitely not just one dance for you."

I laughed. "Fair. It's our first real public date. First time as an official couple in front of our entire class."

"Pressure."

"So much pressure. But also—we earned this. We fought for eight months to be together. We're allowed to celebrate."

"What's he like? Really?"

I thought about how to explain Ethan. "He's brilliant and doesn't believe it. He's excellent at everything and apologizes for it. He spent seventeen years being controlled and is just now figuring out what freedom means."

"He sounds complicated."

"He's worth the complication."

"You're so gone for him."

"Completely. Embarrassingly. Totally gone."

Maya grinned. "I can't wait to meet you guys. Move-in is August 15th, right? That's like ten weeks away."

"Ten weeks of summer. Normal summer. Just... existing and being teenagers."

"Except for your three weeks at national badminton training."

"Except for that."

"And his club hockey commitments."

"Okay, semi-normal summer."

After we hung up, I realized: this was my future. Video calls with roommates, planning for college, thinking about life beyond Winnipeg. It felt impossibly far away and startlingly close at the same time.

Thursday, June 7th—prom day—started early.

My mother had taken the day off work specifically to help me get ready. She was more excited than I was.

"Hair appointment at 2 PM," she said, consulting the schedule she'd made like we were planning a military operation. "Makeup at 3:30. Dress at 4:30. Pictures at 5. Ethan picks you up at 6."

"Mom, it's prom, not a wedding."

"It's your only high school prom. We're doing it right."

At 2 PM, I sat in a salon chair while a stylist named Jennifer worked magic with a curling iron and bobby pins. Half-up, half-down, loose curls, elegant but not trying too hard.

"Big night?" Jennifer asked.

"Prom."

"Senior prom?"

"Yeah."

"Date someone special?"

I thought about how to answer that. "He's... yeah. Really special."

"First love?"

"Only love," I said before I could stop myself.

Jennifer smiled in the mirror. "Those are the ones you remember forever."

At 3:30, the makeup artist—Michelle, a friend of my mother's—did my face with a light touch. "You have good skin. We're just enhancing, not hiding."

Natural-looking makeup that somehow made me look like a better version of myself. Defined eyes, subtle lips, just enough to be noticeable without being obvious.

At 4:30, I put on the dress.

It fit perfectly. The alterations had been completed earlier that week, and now it hung exactly right. I looked in my bedroom mirror—hair done, makeup applied, dress perfect, badminton calluses visible on my hands because I refused to cover them.

I looked like me. Just... more.

My mother started crying.

"Don't," I said. "You'll make me cry and ruin the makeup."

"You're so beautiful. When did you grow up?"

"Probably around the time I started dating an emancipated hockey player and making life-altering college decisions."

She laughed through tears. "Fair point."

At 5 PM, my dad set up his camera equipment in the backyard. "We're doing this right," he declared, echoing my mother.

At 5:30, Caroline's car pulled up.

She'd offered to bring Ethan and stay for pictures—building this weird extended family thing we'd created over the past few weeks. She got out first, dressed nicely in a summer dress, camera in hand.

Then Ethan stepped out of the car, and my brain stopped working.

He wore the tuxedo we'd chosen. Black jacket perfectly fitted to his frame, white shirt crisp and bright, blue tie that matched my dress exactly. His hair was styled—still him, but intentional. He'd shaved. He looked older, polished, absolutely devastating.

He saw me and froze.

"Sophie—" He stopped. Started again. "You look—"

"Words, Mercer. Use words."

"I don't have words." He crossed the yard slowly, like he was afraid I might disappear. "You're beautiful. That's inadequate, but it's all my brain can produce right now."

"You're not so bad yourself."

"I feel like an imposter in this tux."

"You look like you were born to wear it."

Our mothers were crying. Our respective parents were taking photos. We were standing in my backyard like characters in a movie, and I couldn't quite believe this was real.

"Ready for pictures?" Dad asked.

For the next thirty minutes, we posed. Separate photos, together photos, with parents, without parents, serious faces, silly faces, looking at each other, looking at the camera.

My favorite was one Dad took when we didn't know he was shooting: Ethan adjusting my hair while I laughed at something he'd said. Completely natural. Completely us.

Caroline and my mother were best friends by the time we finished, bonding over having teenagers who'd survived impossible circumstances and made it to prom.

At 6 PM exactly, Ethan offered his arm. "Ready?"

"Ready."

We took his car—the one Caroline had helped him buy last week with money from his part-time coaching job. A used Honda Civic that was his, paid for with his money, his choice. He was unreasonably proud of it.

"First real date in my own car," he said as we drove to the restaurant.

"First real date in public where we don't have to hide or explain or justify."

"First real date where I can just be your boyfriend without it being a crisis."

"Just boyfriend-girlfriend at prom. Completely normal."

"We've never been completely normal."

"True. But we can pretend for one night."

Dinner was at an Italian place downtown—nice but not absurdly fancy, good food, warm atmosphere. A group reservation with several other couples from school, including some of Ethan's hockey teammates and their dates.

Jordan Chen—one of Ethan's closest friends—raised his glass when we arrived. "To Mercer, who turned down the NHL to go to college. Still not sure if you're brilliant or insane."

"Can't it be both?" Ethan asked.

"Definitely both," Jordan's date agreed.

We ate pasta and bread, laughed at stupid jokes, talked about summer plans and college acceptances and futures that seemed impossibly close. Normal teenagers having normal conversations, like we hadn't spent the last eight months in crisis mode.

Madison—Ethan's ex-girlfriend—was there with her new boyfriend, a guy named Alex from the debate team. She caught my eye across the table and smiled genuinely. No animosity. Just two people who'd moved on to better fits.

After dinner, we caravanned to the hotel where prom was being held. The ballroom was decorated in silver and blue, with lights strung everywhere and a DJ already playing music that was too loud for conversation.

"This is surreal," Ethan said as we found our table.

"Good surreal or bad surreal?"

"Good. Definitely good." He looked around at classmates laughing and dancing, at the decorations and the chaos and the sheer normalcy of it all. "I didn't think I'd get this. Normal teenage experiences. I thought Robert would control everything forever."

"But you're here."

"I'm here. Free, emancipated, going to MIT, and at prom with the smartest girl I know." He took my hand. "I'm exactly where I want to be."

The first slow song started around 8 PM.

"Can I ask you something?" I said as we stepped onto the dance floor.

"Always."

"Do you know how to dance?"

"Not even a little bit. You?"

"I play badminton. I have decent footwork. But actual dancing? No idea."

"Then we'll figure it out together."

We did. Badly at first—stepping on each other's feet, laughing at our complete lack of coordination. But gradually, we found a rhythm. His hand at the small of my back. My arms around his neck. Swaying more than actually dancing, but together.

Around us, the entire senior class was dancing. Couples who'd been together for years, brand new couples, groups of friends dancing together, people who came alone dancing in clusters. Everyone just existing in the moment.

"Everyone's watching us," Ethan murmured.

"Let them watch."

"Doesn't it bother you?"

"Not even a little bit." I looked up at him. "We earned this. We fought for this. They can watch all they want."

He kissed me then—soft and quick and completely appropriate for a school dance. When he pulled back, he was smiling.

"What?" I asked.

"I'm happy. Just... genuinely happy. I don't think I've felt this in years."

"Good. You deserve happy."

The song ended. Another started—upbeat and energetic. The mood shifted from slow and romantic to chaotic and joyful.

Ethan's hockey teammates pulled him into their circle. My badminton friends pulled me into theirs. For the next hour, we danced separately and together, with friends and alone, lost in the music and the moment and the sheer relief of being normal teenagers at a normal dance.

Around 9:30, the DJ announced prom court.

I'd forgotten about prom court. Nominations had happened weeks ago, when everything was crisis and chaos. I hadn't paid attention.

"And your prom king and queen," the DJ announced, "Ethan Mercer and Madison Hayes!"

Ethan's face went white. Madison looked equally shocked.

"That's your ex-girlfriend," I said.

"Very aware."

"You have to go up there."

"I really don't want to."

"I know. But you do."

He squeezed my hand once, then made his way to the stage where Madison was already waiting. They looked at each other, laughed at the absurdity, and accepted their crowns with good humor.

"Speech!" someone shouted.

Madison took the microphone. "Thanks, everyone. This is weird and wonderful and completely unexpected." She looked at Ethan. "You want to say something?"

He took the mic reluctantly. "Uh, thanks? I guess? This is strange because Madison and I aren't together anymore, but that's okay because we're both with people who make us really happy." He found me in the crowd. "So thanks for the crown, but I'm good with just being here."

The crowd cheered. Ethan escaped the stage as quickly as possible.

"That was smooth," I said when he got back.

"That was terrifying."

"You handled it perfectly."

"I panicked and told everyone I'm happy with you in front of the entire class."

"I noticed. It was sweet."

"It was survival."

We danced until the DJ announced last song—some classic slow number that everyone knew. Ethan pulled me close, and we swayed in the dim light as the song played and prom wound down.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being here. For making this possible. For being someone worth choosing MIT for."

"You didn't choose MIT for me."

"I chose MIT for a lot of reasons. You're one of them." He rested his forehead against mine. "Not the only reason. But a really good one."

"We should probably get out of here before I start crying and ruin my makeup."

"Good plan."

The after-party was at Jordan's house—his parents had gone out of town specifically so he could host. By the time we arrived around 11:30, it was already packed with classmates.

No alcohol—Jordan's parents had made that clear—but plenty of food, music, and the chaotic energy of teenagers celebrating the end of high school.

Ethan and I found a quiet corner of the back deck, away from the noise but still part of the party.

"This is nice," I said.

"Being away from people?"

"Being with you while people exist nearby. The best of both worlds."

Madison appeared with her boyfriend Alex. "Mind if we join you?"

We made space. The four of us sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching other classmates dance and laugh inside.

"I owe you an apology," Madison said to me.

"For what?"

"For being weird about you and Ethan in the beginning. For not understanding what you had." She looked at her boyfriend. "I get it now. When it's right, it's obvious."

"No apology needed," I said. "You were fine."

"I was petty. But I'm over it." She smiled at Ethan. "I'm glad you're happy. Really."

"Same to you," Ethan said. "Alex seems great."

"He is. We're both going to University of British Columbia in the fall. Going to try the long-distance thing."

"It can work," I said. "If you're both committed."

"That's what everyone says." Madison stood up. "Anyway, I just wanted to clear the air. No hard feelings?"

"None," Ethan assured her.

After they left, Ethan looked at me. "That was remarkably mature."

"We're all growing up. Apparently even Madison."

"Terrifying thought."

We stayed at the party until 2 AM, when parents started texting that it was time to come home. The drive back was quiet—both of us exhausted, happy, completely wrung out from the night.

At my door, Ethan kissed me goodnight like he was sealing a perfect evening.

"Best prom ever," he said.

"Only prom ever."

"Best regardless." He touched the side of my face gently. "Three weeks until graduation. Then summer. Then MIT."

"Then everything else."

"I'm ready for everything else."

"Me too."

I watched him drive away—his car, his choice, his life he was building. Then I went inside where my mother was waiting up despite the late hour.

"How was it?" she asked.

"Perfect." I kicked off my shoes, pulled bobby pins from my hair. "Completely, impossibly perfect."

"Good. You deserved perfect."

I looked at the photos Dad had uploaded already—me and Ethan in the backyard, at dinner, on the dance floor. Evidence that we'd made it. That we'd survived everything and found our way to this moment.

In the photos, we looked happy. Really, genuinely happy.

Because we were.

The next three weeks blurred together in a haze of final preparations and celebrations.

Finals were done. Classes were over. We had nothing to do but exist and prepare for graduation.

Ethan spent time with Caroline, helping her settle into her new apartment and new job. She'd started work at the architecture firm the week after prom—office management with potential to expand into design work later.

"She's so happy," Ethan told me one afternoon as we walked through the park. "I've never seen her like this. Light. Free. Herself."

"Divorce agrees with her."

"Freedom agrees with her. Finally making her own choices." He smiled. "She reminds me of you, actually. That determined focus when she's working on something she cares about."

I spent time with my badminton coach, preparing for the national training program in July. Three weeks of elite development in Toronto—I was excited and terrified in equal measure.

"You'll be fine," Coach assured me. "You're one of the best young players in the country. This program is the next logical step."

"What if I'm not good enough?"

"Then you'll learn and come back better. But you are good enough. Trust me."

Ethan and I found pockets of time just for us. Normal dates. Movies, coffee shops, walks by the river. Being seventeen and in love without crisis or deadline.

We talked about MIT constantly—planning, dreaming, worrying.

"What if the academics are too hard?" Ethan asked one night over ice cream.

"Then we'll study harder. Together."

"What if we drift apart? Different schedules, different friends, different buildings?"

"Then we'll make time. On purpose. Because we matter."

"What if—"

"We'll figure it out," I interrupted. "Whatever happens, we'll figure it out. That's what we do."

On June 25th, graduation invitations went out.

I got mine in the mail—heavy cardstock, official school seal, my name printed in elegant font. **Sophia Marie Liu, Class of 2025.**

Ethan's said **Ethan James Mercer, Class of 2025.**

We were really graduating. Really leaving high school. Really moving on.

"Are you ready?" I asked him.

"No. But I'm doing it anyway."

"Same."

Three days before graduation, Caroline hosted a small dinner party at her apartment. Just her, Ethan, me, and my parents. Our weird blended family, celebrating milestones together.

"To both of you," Dad said, raising his glass. "You've handled more in the past eight months than most people handle in a lifetime. I'm proud of both of you."

"To survival," Caroline added. "And to choosing yourselves."

"To MIT," my mother said. "And to futures you're building on your own terms."

"To freedom," Ethan said quietly. "Terrifying, overwhelming, beautiful freedom."

We clinked glasses and ate Caroline's carefully prepared meal. The conversation flowed easily—about college, about summer plans, about the future spreading out uncertain and exciting ahead of us.

At the end of the night, as my parents were leaving, Dad pulled Ethan aside. I couldn't hear what they said, but I saw Ethan's face shift from surprise to emotion to gratitude.

"What did he say?" I asked on the drive home.

"He said he was proud of me. That I reminded him of himself at my age—trying to figure out how to be good at everything without sacrificing myself in the process." Ethan's voice was thick. "He said if I ever needed anything—advice, help, a quiet place to think—his door was always open."

"He's a good dad."

"He's the dad I wish I'd had. No offense to Robert."

"All the offense to Robert is appropriate."

The night before graduation, I couldn't sleep.

At midnight, I texted Ethan: *You awake?*

He responded immediately: *Can't turn my brain off.*

*Meet me at the park?*

*15 minutes.*

We met at our swings—the place where we'd had so many important conversations. The June night was perfect—warm but not hot, stars visible through light pollution, sounds of the city quiet at this hour.

"Tomorrow we graduate," Ethan said, swinging gently.

"Tomorrow we're done with high school."

"Tomorrow we're officially adults."

"We've been adults for a while now. Tomorrow just makes it official."

He was quiet for a moment. "Are you scared?"

"Terrified. You?"

"Completely." He dragged his feet through the mulch, stopping his swing. "Everything's changing. Everything we've known, everyone we've been around, the entire structure of our lives. In three months we'll be at MIT, and this—" he gestured around, "—all of this will be memory."

"Good memory though."

"Some good. Some terrible. Lots of complicated."

"That's life, I think. Good and terrible and complicated all mixed together."

"When did you get so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You were just too distracted to notice." I stopped my swing too, turned to face him. "We're going to be okay. At MIT, after MIT, all of it. We're going to be okay."

"How do you know?"

"Because we've survived everything thrown at us so far. We'll survive the next things too."

He reached across the space between swings and took my hand. "Promise?"

"Promise. Together."

"Always together."

We stayed until the sky started to lighten—talking about everything and nothing, processing the end of one chapter and the beginning of whatever came next.

At 5:30 AM, as sunrise painted the sky pink and gold, Ethan pulled me close.

"Thank you," he said. "For everything. For being here, for asking hard questions, for not trying to control my decisions. For being exactly who you are."

"Back at you."

"I'm serious. You changed my life, Sophie."

"You changed your own life. I just watched and asked questions."

"You were more than that. You were proof that different was possible. That excellent didn't have to mean sacrificed. That I could be more than one thing." He kissed my forehead. "You saved me."

"You saved yourself. I just reminded you that you could."

We watched the sun rise over Winnipeg—the city that had brought us together, kept us apart, tested us relentlessly, and ultimately let us go.

"Ready for graduation?" Ethan asked as the first rays of sunlight broke over buildings.

"Ready as I'll ever be."

"That's not very confident."

"It's honest. And that's better."

We drove home separately—him to Caroline's apartment, me to my house. Three hours to shower, change, prepare for graduation.

Three hours until high school officially ended and the rest of our lives officially began.

Three hours until we walked across that stage and stepped into whatever came next.

I couldn't wait.

I was terrified.

Both were true, and both were valid.

And that was exactly where I needed to be.
