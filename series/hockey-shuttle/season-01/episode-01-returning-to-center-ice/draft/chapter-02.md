# Chapter 2: Now

## Sunday, September 4th - Day Before School

Sophia spent Sunday trying on different versions of herself.

Navy henley and jeans.

Black t-shirt and jeans.

Green sweater.

Gray hoodie.

She settled on the navy henley, then immediately questioned the decision. Because what did it matter what she wore? Ethan might not even remember her. Or worse, he might remember her and not care.

Her phone buzzed. Maya: **First day outfit check? Send pics!**

Sophia took a selfie in the mirror, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

**Maya: You look cute! Very "smart but approachable." The henley is perfect.**

**Sophia: Thanks. Nervous.**

**Maya: You'll be fine. Just be yourself.**

But Sophia had no idea who herself was anymore. The girl who'd left Brampton three days ago? The nine-year-old who used to race Ethan across fresh ice? Someone completely new?

She opened Instagram again, thumb hovering over Ethan's profile. She'd looked at it probably fifty times since yesterday. @ethanprice23. His most recent story was from this morning: a video of him doing pull-ups in what looked like a home gym. Caption: "Season starts tomorrow. Ready."

732 views already.

Before she could overthink it, she typed a message: **Hey. Weird question, but do you remember me? Sophia Chen from Millbrook. I'm starting at St. Paul's tomorrow.**

Her finger hovered over send for thirty seconds.

Then she deleted it.

Too desperate. Too needy. Too much like she'd spent eight years thinking about him when he'd probably forgotten her entirely.

She put her phone face-down and tried to sleep, but all she could see was the staircase at St. Paul's, the one from the virtual tour on the school's website. That's where people gathered between classes. That's where she'd probably see him.

If she saw him at all.

## Monday, September 5th - First Day, Junior Year

Sophia woke up at 5:47 AM after barely sleeping.

She showered, dressed in the outfit she'd picked out, and spent twenty minutes on her hair before giving up and pulling it into a ponytail. Natural. Effortless. Like she wasn't going to a school where her former best friend was now a hockey star with a perfect life.

Downstairs, her father was already deep in his laptop, reviewing lecture notes. Her mother had left earlier for a faculty meeting.

"Ready?" he asked without looking up.

"Definitely not."

"You'll be fine. You're brilliant."

"That's not how high school works, Dad."

He finally glanced at her. "How does high school work?"

Sophia poured herself coffee—too much creamer, not enough actual caffeine. "It's a complex social ecosystem with hierarchies based on arbitrary factors like athletic ability, physical attractiveness, and whether you know the right people. Academic achievement is actually a negative indicator of social success."

"That sounds like something you read on the internet."

"It's something I observed for two years at Brampton. Why would Winnipeg be different?"

Her father closed his laptop. "Sophia. I know this is hard. I know you didn't want to move. But this is an incredible opportunity for your mother and me professionally, and we really think—"

"It's fine." She cut him off because she couldn't have this conversation again. They'd had it a dozen times since announcing the move in June. "I'm fine. Everything's fine."

He studied her with that physicist look, like she was a problem he was trying to solve. Then he sighed.

"You know, when I was sixteen, my family moved from Shanghai to Toronto. I didn't speak English very well yet. I thought I'd never make friends."

"Did you?"

"Eventually. It took time."

"How much time?"

"About a year."

A year. Sophia had two years of high school left. That meant she'd be friendless until senior year. And by then everyone would already have their college plans, their established groups.

Perfect.

Just perfect.

"I have to go," she said, dumping the rest of her coffee in the sink. "Don't want to be late."

St. Paul's High School was a twelve-minute walk from their new house. Sophia knew because she'd timed it yesterday, scouting the route like she was planning a military operation. Twelve minutes of neutral territory before entering hostile social landscape.

The building was newer than Brampton High—all glass and modern architecture, probably renovated in the last decade. The parking lot was full of nice cars. Not rich-rich, but comfortable-rich. Hockey money, probably. Everyone knew Winnipeg was a hockey city.

Sophia joined the stream of students flowing through the main entrance, trying to look like she belonged. The hallways were crowded and loud, full of people hugging and laughing and picking up conversations from wherever they'd left them in June.

She navigated through them with her head down, avoiding eye contact, trying to be invisible.

The main office was easy to find. The secretary—Mrs. Kowalski, according to her nameplate—was efficient and kind, the type of adult who actually remembered what it felt like to be sixteen and terrified.

"Chen, Sophia," she said, pulling up the file. "Transfer from Brampton, Ontario. Welcome to St. Paul's!"

"Thanks."

"You're in the academic stream, I see. Taking physics, calculus, English, history, chemistry, and..." She scrolled. "Badminton for your athletics credit. That's wonderful! We have an excellent badminton program here. Maya Foster is the team captain—she's a sweetheart."

Sophia nodded, accepting her schedule and locker assignment. Locker 247, second floor, west wing. She committed it to memory and escaped before Mrs. Kowalski could suggest she join any clubs or try out for student council or do any of the things that required talking to people.

The hallway was even more crowded now. Sophia checked her phone: 8:23. Classes started at 8:45. She had time to find her locker, drop off her jacket, maybe hide in the bathroom until first period.

The staircase to the second floor was wide and central, with students gathering on every step. This was the heart of the school, she realized. The place where social hierarchies played out in real time.

She was halfway up when she saw him.

---

Seventh step up when she saw him.

Her brain just—stopped.

Sophia's foot was on the seventh step when her eyes found him at the top landing, and everything else disappeared.

Ethan Price.

She recognized him instantly, which was insane because it had been eight years and people changed dramatically between nine and seventeen. But something about the way he moved—confident, easy, like he knew exactly where he belonged—was exactly the same.

He was taller. Obviously. His hair was darker than she remembered, pushed back carelessly from his face. His shoulders were broader, his jaw more defined. He was wearing a St. Paul's hockey jacket—navy and gold—and he was surrounded by at least six people, all talking at once, all vying for his attention.

He looked good. Really good. Not in an objective observation way but in a way that made her mouth go dry.

She should keep walking. Should get to her locker, start her day, pretend she'd never seen him. What were the odds he'd remember her anyway? They'd been kids. He'd had eight years to become someone completely different, make important friends, build a life that had nothing to do with Saturday mornings at a community rink.

But then—impossibly—he looked up.

Their eyes met across the crowded staircase.

Sophia watched recognition dawn on his face. Saw his expression shift from casual laughter to surprise to something she couldn't read. Saw him excuse himself from his group and start moving toward the stairs.

Toward her.

No no no no no.

She was frozen on step seven, students streaming past her, bumping her shoulder, muttering "excuse me." Her ears rang.

Ethan reached her, and the world came crashing back—sound, the smell of bodies and cafeteria food. But all Sophia could see was him standing two steps above her, looking at her like she was a math problem that didn't make sense.

"Sophia?" He said her full name, not Soph, and something about that felt wrong. "Sophia Chen?"

Her voice came out smaller than she wanted. "Hi."

"Holy shit." He ran a hand through his hair, still staring. "What are you— When did you— You're here?"

"Apparently."

"I mean—" He laughed, but it sounded nervous. "Sorry. I just— It's been a while."

"Eight years."

"Yeah. Eight years." He was staring at her like she was a ghost. "You look— You look different. Obviously. We were nine."

"You look different too."

This was excruciating. This was worse than being friendless. This was seeing someone who used to know you and realizing they didn't anymore, not really, and having to navigate that gap in a crowded high school staircase while people stared.

"Are you transferring here?" Ethan asked. "To St. Paul's?"

"Yeah. My parents got jobs at U of M. We moved last weekend."

"That's—wow. That's crazy." He seemed genuinely shocked, which meant he hadn't been stalking her Instagram. Which meant he probably hadn't thought about her at all in eight years. "I can't believe you're here."

A girl's voice cut through the moment: "Ethan! There you are!"

Sophia's stomach sank as Becca Martinez appeared—tall, beautiful, perfect dark hair and perfect makeup and a perfect smile aimed directly at Ethan. This had to be Becca. The girlfriend from Instagram.

"Hey Becs." Ethan straightened up slightly, his body language shifting. "What's up?"

"Student council meeting in five minutes. You promised you'd be there for the fall events discussion, remember?" Becca turned to Sophia, and her smile didn't waver but it changed somehow. Became more polite, less warm. "Hi! I'm Becca Martinez. You're new, right?"

"Sophia Chen. I just transferred."

"Welcome to St. Paul's! Are you settling in okay?"

It was a perfectly nice question from a perfectly nice person, and Sophia hated every second of it.

"Fine, thanks."

"Sophia and I actually know each other," Ethan said. "From when we were kids. In Millbrook."

Becca's eyebrows rose slightly. "Oh? That's such a coincidence!"

"Yeah." Ethan checked his phone. "Listen, I should get to that meeting, but Sophia, we should—do you want to maybe grab lunch later? Catch up properly?"

Sophia's brain supplied several responses:
- *No thanks, I can see you're busy*
- *I don't want to intrude on your perfect life*
- *Please don't pity-friend me*

What she actually said was: "Sure."

"Cool. Meet at the cafeteria? First lunch is 11:30."

"Okay."

Becca linked her arm through Ethan's—a casual gesture that screamed *mine*—and smiled at Sophia. "Nice meeting you, Sophia!"

Then they were gone, disappearing into the crowd, and Sophia was alone on the staircase wondering what the hell just happened.

She closed her eyes.

Seeing Ethan again—that was a force she hadn't planned for. And she had no idea how to balance it.

## Ethan's POV - The Same Moment

Ethan Price was telling Tyler about the new defensive strategy Coach wanted to implement when he saw her.

At first, his brain didn't process it. Just registered *girl on staircase* and moved on. But something made him look again, and then—

Holy shit.

Sophia Chen.

He hadn't thought about Sophia Chen in years. Well, that wasn't true. He thought about her sometimes, in that vague way you think about childhood friends who'd disappeared from your life. Wondered where she was, what she was doing, if she still remembered those Saturday mornings at the rink.

But he hadn't expected her to materialize on the staircase at St. Paul's, looking completely different and exactly the same.

"—are you even listening?" Tyler was saying.

"Sorry, I—" Ethan watched her climb the stairs, uncertain and guarded. "I'll be right back."

He excused himself from the group and headed for the stairs, his mind racing. Sophia Chen. Here. At his school. What were the odds?

She'd changed. Of course she'd changed—eight years, childhood to almost-adult. But something in the way she moved was familiar. That careful precision, like she was calculating every step.

He stopped two steps above her, and when she looked up at him, he felt something shift in his chest. Her eyes were the same. Dark, intelligent, seeing more than people expected.

"Sophia?" He used her full name because Soph felt too familiar after eight years. "Sophia Chen?"

She looked terrified. "Hi."

And just like that, Ethan was nine years old again, teaching crossovers to a quiet girl who understood things no one else did. The only person in Millbrook who'd cared about math competitions as much as hockey.

"Holy shit. What are you— When did you— You're here?"

"Apparently."

He laughed, trying to process this. "Sorry. I just— It's been a while."

"Eight years."

Eight years. He'd gone from nine-year-old Novice player to junior year captain. He'd lost his gap tooth, grown a foot, gotten serious about hockey. He'd made friends, gotten a girlfriend, built an entire life.

And Sophia Chen had been... where? What had she been doing for eight years?

"You look different," he said, because it was true and also completely inadequate. "Obviously. We were nine."

"You look different too."

Ethan wanted to ask her a thousand questions. Why was she here? How long had she been in Winnipeg? Did she still do math? Did she remember their last day at the rink? Did she ever think about him?

But they were blocking the stairs, and people were staring, and Becca was going to find him any second and—

"Are you transferring here? To St. Paul's?"

"Yeah. My parents got jobs at U of M. We moved last weekend."

Last weekend. Which meant she'd been here for days and hadn't told him. Which meant—what? That she hadn't wanted to? That she thought he wouldn't care?

"That's crazy," he said, and it was. "I can't believe you're here."

Then Becca appeared, and Ethan felt himself shift into performance mode automatically. Student council president's boyfriend. Team captain. The version of himself everyone expected.

He introduced them, watched Sophia shrink under Becca's friendly interrogation, and felt weirdly protective. This was his friend from before. Before AAA hockey and scouts and the weight of everyone's expectations. She knew him when he was just Ethan, not "Ethan Price, future NHL player."

"We should grab lunch," he heard himself say. "Catch up properly."

Sophia agreed, and Becca pulled him away to the meeting, and Ethan spent the entire forty-five minutes thinking about a girl he used to teach crossovers to instead of fall event budgets.

## Sophia - Calculus, First Period

First period: Calculus with Mr. Reynolds.

Sophia slid into an empty seat near the back and immediately pulled out her notebook. If she looked busy, maybe no one would try to talk to her.

The classroom filled up quickly. Everyone seemed to know each other, trading summer stories and complaining about workload. Sophia kept her head down and tried to blend into the furniture.

"Okay, settle down!" Mr. Reynolds was young for a teacher, maybe early thirties, with the kind of energy that suggested he actually liked teenagers. "Welcome to Calculus, where we'll be exploring the beautiful world of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Who's excited?"

Silence.

"Tough crowd." He grinned. "Right, let's start with a diagnostic to see where everyone's at. Don't panic—this isn't graded. I just want to know what you remember from pre-calc."

He passed out a worksheet, and Sophia relaxed slightly. Math she could do. Math made sense.

She worked through the problems methodically: limits, basic derivatives, related rates. They were review from last year, stuff she'd found easy at Brampton. She finished in twelve minutes and checked her work twice while everyone else was still on problem four.

When Mr. Reynolds collected the worksheets, he glanced at hers and did a double-take.

"Sophia, right? The new transfer?"

"Yes."

"This is perfect. All of it." He sounded impressed. "Were you in an accelerated program at your old school?"

"Just regular academic stream."

"Well, you're going to do great here. Might even give Ethan a run for his money—he's usually my top student."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "Ethan's in this class?"

"Should be. Although he's not—oh, there he is."

The door opened and Ethan slipped in, slightly out of breath. "Sorry, student council ran late."

"No problem. Grab a diagnostic sheet and have a seat."

Ethan's eyes found Sophia in the back, and he smiled—quick, genuine—before taking a seat three rows ahead. Close enough that she could see the back of his neck, the way his hair curled slightly at the edge. Far enough that she couldn't accidentally make eye contact.

Perfect. This was perfect. She'd be spending an hour a day watching the back of Ethan Price's head while trying not to think about how he used to be her best friend and now he was a stranger with a girlfriend and a life that didn't include her.

Mr. Reynolds launched into a lecture about the course outline, and Sophia took notes mechanically. Normally she loved calculus—the precision of it, the way everything built on everything else. But today she couldn't focus. She kept getting distracted by the way Ethan leaned back in his chair, completely relaxed, like he belonged everywhere he went.

When the bell rang, he turned around.

"Hey. You're coming to lunch, right?"

"I said I would."

"Cool. I'll meet you at the caf." He hesitated. "It's good to have you here, Soph. I mean it."

Soph. He'd called her Soph, finally, and it felt like something unlocking.

"Thanks," she managed.

Then he was gone, swept up by friends who all seemed to need him urgently, and Sophia was left wondering if lunch was going to be the best or worst decision she'd made all day.

---

## Ethan's POV - Between Classes

Ethan couldn't stop thinking about her.

Which was stupid. He had a chemistry quiz to study for and practice at 3:30 and Becca wanted to talk about homecoming plans. He didn't have time to be distracted by a girl from his past who'd randomly shown up.

But he kept seeing her face when she'd said "eight years." Like she'd been counting. Like those Saturday mornings had mattered to her too.

Tyler caught up to him outside the chemistry lab. "Dude, what was that?"

"What was what?"

"The staircase thing. Who's the girl?"

"Old friend from Millbrook. Sophia Chen. We used to skate together."

Tyler's eyebrows rose. "Old friend, huh?"

"Yeah. Why?"

"Nothing. Just, you looked pretty intense talking to her."

"Did I?" Ethan hadn't realized. He'd just been... surprised. Thrown off balance by a variable he hadn't anticipated.

"Becca noticed too."

Of course she did. Becca noticed everything.

"It's not a big deal," Ethan said. "Just weird seeing someone from that long ago."

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't true. Because standing on that staircase talking to Sophia, he'd felt something he hadn't felt in years: recognized. Like she could see past the performance to whoever he actually was underneath.

And he had no idea what to do with that.

---

## Lunch - The Cafeteria

By the time third period ended (Physics with Dr. Okafor, who seemed legitimately excited about mechanics), Sophia had worked herself into a state of low-level panic.

She could just skip lunch. Say she felt sick. Go hide in the library.

But that would make her a coward. And besides, she was hungry.

The cafeteria was overwhelming—huge, loud, full of established social groups staking out their territories. Sophia stood in the doorway scanning for Ethan and feeling increasingly like this was a mistake.

"Sophia!" He was waving from a table near the windows. "Over here!"

She navigated through the crowd, clutching her lunch bag. Ethan was sitting with three other people: Becca, a guy with sandy hair and a hockey jacket, and another girl who was scrolling through her phone.

"Hey!" Ethan gestured to the empty seat next to him. "Everyone, this is Sophia. We were friends when we were kids. Sophia, this is Becca—you met her earlier—Tyler, and Jess."

"Hey." Tyler nodded at her. "You're the transfer from Ontario, right?"

"Yeah."

"Cool. You play any sports?"

"Badminton."

"Nice!" Jess looked up from her phone. "Maya's great. You'll love the team."

Becca smiled. "So tell us about Millbrook. Is it as small as Ethan says?"

"Smaller, probably."

"We had one grocery store," Ethan said. "One. And the pizza place closed at eight."

"That sounds kind of nice, actually," Jess said. "Winnipeg can be overwhelming sometimes."

Tyler snorted. "You think Winnipeg is overwhelming? Try moving here from Ontario."

"Toronto's different though," Becca said. "That's actually a big city."

They launched into a debate about city sizes, and Sophia sat quietly, eating her sandwich and trying to figure out the social dynamics. Tyler and Ethan were clearly close—probably teammates. Jess seemed quieter, more observant. And Becca was... Becca was the kind of person who made everything look easy. She laughed at the right moments, asked follow-up questions, kept the conversation flowing.

She was also sitting very close to Ethan. Not touching, exactly, but in that way that suggested they were together. Comfortable. Established.

"So Sophia," Becca said, turning her attention away from the group. "What made your family move to Winnipeg?"

"My parents got research positions at U of M. My mom's in chemistry, my dad's in physics."

"Professor parents!" Tyler grinned. "That explains why you and Price are both nerds."

"Says the guy taking AP Bio," Ethan shot back.

"That's for medical school applications. Different kind of nerd."

"Still a nerd."

Watching them banter felt like watching a play she hadn't rehearsed for. They had rhythms, shared history. Sophia was the outsider trying to catch up, and it was exhausting.

"Do you know what you want to study?" Becca asked. "In college?"

"Engineering, maybe. Or physics."

"Like father, like daughter," Ethan said. "You always were going to end up in STEM."

"What about you?" The question came out before Sophia could stop it. "Are you still thinking NHL?"

The table went quiet for just a second. Tyler and Jess exchanged a glance.

"That's the plan," Ethan said carefully. "If it works out."

"It'll work out," Tyler said firmly. "Price is the best player in the province. Scouts are already watching."

"We'll see." Ethan's voice had that careful quality again, the one that meant he was trying to sound confident but wasn't quite there. "Lots can happen in two years."

Becca reached over and squeezed his hand. "You're going to be amazing. Like always."

The gesture was small, casual, but it hit Sophia like a wall. Right. They were together. And she was the girl from his past, barely a memory, sitting here like she had any right to his present.

"I should go," she said abruptly, standing up. "I have to find the library before next period."

"Oh—okay." Ethan looked surprised. "But lunch isn't over for another fifteen minutes."

"I know. I just— I want to make sure I know where everything is."

"I can show you around after school if you want. Give you the full tour."

"That's okay. I'll figure it out." She grabbed her bag. "Thanks for lunch."

She left before anyone could respond, navigating back through the cafeteria. That was stupid. She'd been rude. They were being nice and she'd just run away like a scared kid.

Every force in her life was pointing in directions she didn't understand, and she had no idea how to find her balance anymore.

She found the library and hid in the back corner until fourth period, trying not to think about Ethan's smile or Becca's hand on his or the way it felt to be the outsider looking in on a life that had once been partly hers.

This was going to be harder than she thought.

---

By the time school ended at 3:15, Sophia was mentally exhausted.

She'd survived History (boring but manageable), Chemistry (actually interesting), and one more period of people looking at her like she was a puzzle they couldn't solve. Now she just wanted to go home, hide in her room, and pretend this day had never happened.

Her phone buzzed as she was walking out.

**Ethan: Hey, are you okay? You left lunch kind of suddenly.**

Sophia stared at the message. She could ignore it. She could make an excuse. She could tell him the truth: that seeing him with his perfect girlfriend and his perfect friends made her feel like the lonely nine-year-old she'd been when he left.

Instead she typed: **Fine. Just overwhelmed. First day stuff.**

The response came immediately: **Totally get it. Listen, I meant what I said about showing you around. No pressure, but if you want to grab coffee or something this week, let me know. Would be good to actually catch up.**

Sophia sat down on a bench outside the main entrance and read the message three times.

He wanted to catch up. He was reaching out. Maybe he did remember their friendship. Maybe it mattered to him too.

Or maybe he just felt obligated because they used to know each other and he was a nice person who helped new students.

She didn't know which was worse.

**Sophia: Maybe. I'll let you know.**

**Ethan: Cool. See you in calc tomorrow.**

She put her phone away and started the twelve-minute walk home, trying to organize her thoughts into something coherent.

Facts:
1. Ethan Price remembered her.
2. He seemed genuinely happy to see her.
3. He had a girlfriend.
4. He had a whole life here that didn't include her.
5. She still felt the same flutter when he smiled at her that she'd felt at nine years old.

Conclusion: This situation required careful management. Minimal emotional investment. Protective distance.

She made it home, survived dinner with her parents.

"How was your first day?"

"Fine."

"Did you make any friends?"

"Not really."

"Give it time, honey."

She retreated to her room to do homework she couldn't focus on.

Her phone buzzed again at 9:47.

**Ethan: One more thing - there's a hockey game Friday night. Season opener. You should come. If you want. No pressure.**

Sophia stared at the message for a full minute.

Going to his hockey game felt like crossing a line. Felt like admitting she wanted to be part of his world. Felt dangerous.

But she was already typing: **Maybe. I'll think about it.**

**Ethan: Cool. It's at Bell MTS Iceplex, 7pm. I can save you a ticket if you decide.**

**Sophia: We'll see.**

**Ethan: :) Good night, Soph.**

**Sophia: Night.**

She put her phone face-down on her nightstand and lay in the dark, staring at the ceiling.

Ethan Price had reentered her life, and every calculation she'd ever made about how to survive high school had just become completely useless.

She was going to go to that game. She knew it already, even though she was trying to pretend she didn't.

She was going to watch him play hockey in front of crowds and scouts and a future that was already written. And she was going to have to figure out how to be happy for him while simultaneously protecting her heart from wanting things that weren't hers to want.

The question was whether she was brave enough to try.

Sophia closed her eyes and tried to sleep, but all she could see was nine-year-old Ethan teaching her crossovers, saying *think of it like a double helix*, making her laugh when she fell.

Eight years ago, she'd lost her best friend.

Now he was back, and she had no idea what that meant.

But she was going to find out.
