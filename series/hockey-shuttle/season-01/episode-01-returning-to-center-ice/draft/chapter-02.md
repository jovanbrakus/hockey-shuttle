# Chapter 2: Now

## Present Day - September 5th - First Day, Junior Year

Sophia stood in front of her closet at 6:47 AM, trying to decide who she wanted to be.

The problem with moving to a new school junior year was that everyone else had already figured out their identities. They'd had two years to establish themselves, make friends, join clubs, become recognizable. Meanwhile, Sophia was standing in her bedroom surrounded by half-unpacked boxes, holding up two different shirts like they were going to solve her existential crisis.

"Just pick one," she muttered to herself.

She went with the navy blue henley. Casual but not trying too hard. Paired with jeans and her beat-up Converse, she looked like someone who wasn't desperate to make friends. Which was perfect, because she was absolutely desperate to make friends but couldn't let anyone know that.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her mother, who'd already left for her first day at the University of Manitoba chemistry department:

**Mom: You've got this! Remember—smile, make eye contact, be yourself. Love you! ❤️**

Sophia typed back a thumbs up emoji and tried not to think about how "be yourself" was terrible advice when yourself was an introverted badminton player with exactly zero social skills.

She grabbed her backpack—new, because apparently her old one from Brampton High wasn't good enough for "a fresh start"—and headed downstairs. Her father was in the kitchen, already deep into his laptop, probably reviewing lecture notes for his first class at U of M.

"Ready?" he asked without looking up.

"Definitely not."

"You'll be fine. You're brilliant."

"That's not how high school works, Dad."

He finally glanced at her. "How does high school work?"

Sophia poured herself coffee—too much creamer, not enough actual caffeine to deal with this day. "It's a complex social ecosystem with hierarchies based on arbitrary factors like athletic ability, physical attractiveness, and whether you know the right people. Academic achievement is actually a negative indicator of social success."

"That sounds like something you read on the internet."

"It's something I observed for two years at Brampton. Why would Winnipeg be different?"

Her father closed his laptop. "Sophia. I know this is hard. I know you didn't want to move. But this is an incredible opportunity for your mother and me professionally, and we really think—"

"It's fine." She cut him off because she couldn't have this conversation again. They'd had it a dozen times since announcing the move in June. "I'm fine. Everything's fine."

He studied her with that physicist look, like she was a problem he was trying to solve. Then he sighed.

"You know, when I was sixteen, my family moved from Shanghai to Toronto. I didn't speak English very well yet. I thought I'd never make friends."

"Did you?"

"Eventually. It took time."

"How much time?"

"About a year."

A year. Sophia had two years of high school left. That meant she'd be friendless until senior year, and then what? Everyone would already have their college plans, their established groups, their inside jokes she'd never understand.

Perfect.

"I have to go," she said, dumping the rest of her coffee in the sink. "Don't want to be late."

St. Paul's High School was a twelve-minute walk from their new house. Sophia knew because she'd timed it yesterday, scouting the route like she was planning a military operation. Twelve minutes of neutral territory before entering hostile social landscape.

The building was newer than Brampton High—all glass and modern architecture, probably renovated in the last decade. The parking lot was full of nice cars. Not rich-rich, but comfortable-rich. Hockey money, probably. Everyone knew Winnipeg was a hockey city.

Sophia joined the stream of students flowing through the main entrance. Her schedule said to report to the main office first, get her locker assignment and student ID. Simple enough.

Except nothing about high school was ever simple.

The hallways were crowded and loud, full of people hugging and laughing and picking up conversations from wherever they'd left them in June. Sophia navigated through them like she was crossing a busy intersection—quick, efficient, trying not to make eye contact.

The main office was easy to find. The secretary—Mrs. Kowalski, according to her nameplate—was efficient and kind, the type of adult who actually remembered what it felt like to be sixteen and terrified.

"Chen, Sophia," she said, pulling up the file. "Transfer from Brampton, Ontario. Welcome to St. Paul's!"

"Thanks."

"You're in the academic stream, I see. Taking physics, calculus, English, history, chemistry, and..." She scrolled. "Badminton for your athletics credit. That's wonderful! We have an excellent badminton program here. Maya Foster is the team captain—she's a sweetheart."

Sophia nodded, accepting her schedule and locker assignment. Locker 247, second floor, west wing. She committed it to memory and escaped before Mrs. Kowalski could suggest she join any clubs or try out for student council or do any of the things that required talking to people.

The hallway was even more crowded now. Sophia checked her phone: 8:23. Classes started at 8:45. She had time to find her locker, drop off her jacket, maybe hide in the bathroom until first period.

She was halfway up the stairs when she saw him.

Ethan Price.

She recognized him instantly, which was insane because it had been eight years and people changed dramatically between nine and seventeen. But something about the way he moved—confident, easy, like he knew exactly where he belonged—was exactly the same. His hair was darker than she remembered, and he was taller (obviously), and his shoulders were broader (hockey training), and he was surrounded by at least six people, all talking at once.

Sophia froze on the staircase.

He looked... good. Really good. Not in a objective-observation way but in a way that made her stomach flip. Dark hair pushed back carelessly, strong jawline, the kind of athletic build that came from years of elite training. He was wearing a St. Paul's hockey jacket—navy and gold—and he was laughing at something one of his friends said, and Sophia suddenly remembered with perfect clarity what it felt like to be nine years old and racing him across fresh ice.

She should keep walking. Should get to her locker, start her day, pretend she'd never seen him. What were the odds he'd remember her anyway? They'd been kids. He'd probably had dozens of friends since then, important friends, hockey friends, friends who mattered.

But then—impossibly—he looked up.

Their eyes met across the crowded hallway, and Sophia watched recognition dawn on his face. His expression shifted from casual laughter to surprise to something she couldn't read, and then he was excusing himself from his group and moving toward the stairs.

Toward her.

No no no no no.

"Sophia?" He said her full name, not Soph, and something about that felt wrong. "Sophia Chen?"

She forced herself to breathe. "Hi."

"Holy shit." He ran a hand through his hair, looking genuinely shocked. "What are you— When did you— You're here?"

"Apparently."

"I mean—" He laughed, but it sounded nervous. "Sorry. I just— It's been a while."

"Eight years."

"Yeah. Eight years." He was staring at her like she was a math problem that didn't make sense. "You look— You look different. Obviously. We were nine."

"You look different too."

This was excruciating. This was worse than being friendless. This was seeing someone who used to know you and realizing they didn't anymore, not really, and having to navigate that gap in a crowded high school hallway while people stared.

"Are you transferring here?" Ethan asked. "To St. Paul's?"

"Yeah. My parents got jobs at U of M. We moved last weekend."

"That's—wow. That's crazy." He seemed to remember they were blocking the stairs and stepped aside, gesturing for her to come up. "Sorry. Do you have a locker assignment yet? I can help you find it. This place is confusing at first."

"I'm okay."

"It's really no problem. I have—" He checked his phone. "Twenty minutes before calc. And we should—I mean, it would be good to catch up. If you want."

The thing was, Sophia did want to catch up. She wanted to ask him a thousand questions: Did you make the NHL like everyone said you would? Do you still do math competitions? Do you remember teaching me crossovers? Do you remember me at all, or am I just some girl from elementary school who doesn't matter anymore?

But she couldn't ask any of that. So instead she said, "Sure. My locker's 247."

"West wing, perfect. I'm 198, so we're close." He started walking, and she fell into step beside him. "This is so weird. Good weird, but weird. Like, what are the odds?"

"Four hundred thirty thousand to one," Sophia said automatically, then winced. "Sorry. That's— I'm not actually calculating odds. It's just something I do when I'm nervous."

Ethan glanced at her, and for just a second, she saw something familiar in his expression. "You still do that? The math thing?"

"What math thing?"

"When we were kids, you'd always turn things into equations. Especially when you were anxious." He grinned. "One time you tried to calculate the exact trajectory needed to throw a dodgeball in gym class. You got hit in the face while you were doing the math."

Sophia felt her face heat. "I don't remember that."

"I do. You had to go to the nurse. I felt terrible because I was the one who threw it."

"You threw it at me?"

"Not on purpose! You were just standing there, not paying attention—" He broke off, laughing. "God, I'm making this worse. The point is, it's good to see you haven't changed completely."

They reached her locker. Sophia spun the combination—12-34-18, easy to remember—and it opened on the first try. Small miracle.

"So you're taking calc?" Ethan asked, leaning against the locker next to hers. "What else?"

"Physics, chemistry, English, history. And badminton."

"Badminton, nice. Maya Foster runs that program—she's great. Super competitive but in a good way." He paused. "Did you keep skating?"

The question landed like a weight.

"No," Sophia said quietly. "I quit after... after you moved."

Something flickered across Ethan's face. Regret, maybe. Or guilt. "Why?"

Because it wasn't fun without you. Because every time I went to the rink I remembered our last day together. Because I was nine and heartbroken and didn't have the emotional vocabulary to understand what I was feeling.

"Just lost interest," she said instead.

"That's too bad. You were getting really good."

Before Sophia could respond, a voice called out: "Ethan! There you are!"

A girl appeared—tall, pretty, confident in that effortless way that made Sophia want to disappear. She had perfect dark hair and perfect makeup and a perfect smile that she aimed directly at Ethan.

"Hey Becs." Ethan straightened up. "What's up?"

"Student council meeting in five minutes. You promised you'd be there for the fall events discussion, remember?" The girl turned to Sophia, and her smile didn't waver but it changed somehow. Became more polite, less warm. "Hi! I'm Becca Martinez. You're new, right?"

"Sophia Chen. I just transferred."

"Welcome to St. Paul's! Are you settling in okay?"

It was a perfectly nice question from a perfectly nice person, and Sophia hated every second of it.

"Fine, thanks."

"Sophia and I actually know each other," Ethan said. "From when we were kids. In Millbrook."

Becca's eyebrows rose slightly. "Oh? That's such a coincidence!"

"Yeah." Ethan checked his phone. "Listen, I should get to that meeting, but Sophia, we should—do you want to maybe grab lunch later? Catch up properly?"

Sophia's brain supplied several responses:
- *No thanks, I can see you're busy*
- *I don't want to intrude on your perfect life*
- *Please don't pity-friend me*

What she actually said was: "Sure."

"Cool. Meet at the cafeteria? First lunch is 11:30."

"Okay."

Becca linked her arm through Ethan's. "We really need to go. Nice meeting you, Sophia!"

Then they were gone, disappearing into the crowd, and Sophia was alone at her locker wondering what the hell just happened.

She closed her eyes. Forces in equilibrium. Net force equals zero.

But that was the problem. Seeing Ethan again—that was a force she hadn't planned for. And she had no idea how to balance it.

---

First period: Calculus with Mr. Reynolds.

Sophia slid into an empty seat near the back and immediately pulled out her notebook. If she looked busy, maybe no one would try to talk to her.

The classroom filled up quickly. Everyone seemed to know each other, trading summer stories and complaining about workload. Sophia kept her head down and tried to blend into the furniture.

"Okay, settle down!" Mr. Reynolds was young for a teacher, maybe early thirties, with the kind of energy that suggested he actually liked teenagers. "Welcome to Calculus, where we'll be exploring the beautiful world of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Who's excited?"

Silence.

"Tough crowd." He grinned. "Right, let's start with a diagnostic to see where everyone's at. Don't panic—this isn't graded. I just want to know what you remember from pre-calc."

He passed out a worksheet, and Sophia relaxed slightly. Math she could do. Math made sense.

She worked through the problems methodically: limits, basic derivatives, related rates. They were review from last year, stuff she'd found easy at Brampton. She finished in twelve minutes and checked her work twice while everyone else was still on problem four.

When Mr. Reynolds collected the worksheets, he glanced at hers and did a double-take.

"Sophia, right? The new transfer?"

"Yes."

"This is perfect. All of it." He sounded impressed. "Were you in an accelerated program at your old school?"

"Just regular academic stream."

"Well, you're going to do great here. Might even give Ethan a run for his money—he's usually my top student."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "Ethan's in this class?"

"Should be. Although he's not—oh, there he is."

The door opened and Ethan slipped in, slightly out of breath. "Sorry, student council ran late."

"No problem. Grab a diagnostic sheet and have a seat."

Ethan's eyes found Sophia in the back, and he smiled—quick, genuine—before taking a seat three rows ahead. Close enough that she could see the back of his neck, the way his hair curled slightly at the edge. Far enough that she couldn't accidentally make eye contact.

Perfect. This was perfect. She'd be spending an hour a day watching the back of Ethan Price's head while trying not to think about how he used to be her best friend and now he was a stranger with a girlfriend and a life that didn't include her.

Mr. Reynolds launched into a lecture about the course outline, and Sophia took notes mechanically. Normally she loved calculus—the precision of it, the way everything built on everything else. But today she couldn't focus. She kept getting distracted by the way Ethan leaned back in his chair, completely relaxed, like he belonged everywhere he went.

When the bell rang, he turned around.

"Hey. You're coming to lunch, right?"

"I said I would."

"Cool. I'll meet you at the caf." He hesitated. "It's good to have you here, Soph. I mean it."

Soph. He'd called her Soph, finally, and it felt like something unlocking.

"Thanks," she managed.

Then he was gone, swept up by friends who all seemed to need him urgently, and Sophia was left wondering if lunch was going to be the best or worst decision she'd made all day.

---

Second period was English Literature with Ms. Park, and Sophia spent the entire class trying not to obsess about lunch.

What would they even talk about? Eight years was a long time. They'd been children then. Now they were—what? Acquaintances? Former friends? People who used to know each other?

By the time third period ended (Physics with Dr. Okafor, who seemed legitimately excited about mechanics), Sophia had worked herself into a state of low-level panic.

She could just skip lunch. Say she felt sick. Go hide in the library.

But that would make her a coward. And besides, she was hungry.

The cafeteria was overwhelming—huge, loud, full of established social groups staking out their territories. Sophia stood in the doorway scanning for Ethan and feeling increasingly like this was a mistake.

"Sophia!" He was waving from a table near the windows. "Over here!"

She navigated through the crowd, clutching her lunch bag. Ethan was sitting with three other people: Becca, a guy with sandy hair and a hockey jacket, and another girl who was scrolling through her phone.

"Hey!" Ethan gestured to the empty seat next to him. "Everyone, this is Sophia. We were friends when we were kids. Sophia, this is Becca—you met her earlier—Tyler, and Jess."

"Hey." Tyler nodded at her. "You're the transfer from Ontario, right?"

"Yeah."

"Cool. You play any sports?"

"Badminton."

"Nice!" Jess looked up from her phone. "Maya's great. You'll love the team."

Becca smiled. "So tell us about Millbrook. Is it as small as Ethan says?"

"Smaller, probably."

"We had one grocery store," Ethan said. "One. And the pizza place closed at eight."

"That sounds kind of nice, actually," Jess said. "Winnipeg can be overwhelming sometimes."

Tyler snorted. "You think Winnipeg is overwhelming? Try moving here from Toronto."

They launched into a debate about city sizes, and Sophia sat quietly, eating her sandwich and trying to figure out the social dynamics. Tyler and Ethan were clearly close—probably teammates. Jess seemed quieter, more observant. And Becca was... Becca was the kind of person who made everything look easy. She laughed at the right moments, asked follow-up questions, kept the conversation flowing.

She was also sitting very close to Ethan. Not touching, exactly, but in that way that suggested they were together. Comfortable. Established.

"So Sophia," Becca said, turning her attention away from the group. "What made your family move to Winnipeg?"

"My parents got research positions at U of M. My mom's in chemistry, my dad's in physics."

"Professor parents!" Tyler grinned. "That explains why you and Price are both nerds."

"Says the guy taking AP Bio," Ethan shot back.

"That's for medical school applications. Different kind of nerd."

"Still a nerd."

Watching them banter felt like watching a play she hadn't rehearsed for. They had rhythms, inside jokes, shared history. Sophia was the outsider trying to catch up, and it was exhausting.

"Do you know what you want to study?" Becca asked. "In college?"

"Engineering, maybe. Or physics."

"Like father, like daughter," Ethan said. "You always were going to end up in STEM."

"What about you?" The question came out before Sophia could stop it. "Are you still thinking NHL?"

The table went quiet for just a second. Tyler and Jess exchanged a glance.

"That's the plan," Ethan said carefully. "If it works out."

"It'll work out," Tyler said firmly. "Price is the best player in the province. Scouts are already watching."

"We'll see." Ethan's voice had that careful quality again, the one that meant he was trying to sound confident but wasn't quite there. "Lots can happen in two years."

Becca reached over and squeezed his hand. "You're going to be amazing. Like always."

The gesture was small, casual, but it hit Sophia like a wall. Right. They were together. And she was the girl from his past, barely a memory, sitting here like she had any right to his present.

"I should go," she said abruptly, standing up. "I have to find the library before next period."

"Oh—okay." Ethan looked surprised. "But lunch isn't over for another fifteen minutes."

"I know. I just— I want to make sure I know where everything is."

"I can show you around after school if you want. Give you the full tour."

"That's okay. I'll figure it out." She grabbed her bag. "Thanks for lunch."

She left before anyone could respond, navigating back through the cafeteria with her heart pounding. That was stupid. She'd been rude. They were being nice and she'd just run away like a scared kid.

Forces in equilibrium, she thought. Net force equals zero.

But she was lying to herself. Every force in her life was pointing in directions she didn't understand, and she had no idea how to find her balance anymore.

She found the library and hid in the back corner until fourth period, trying not to think about Ethan's smile or Becca's hand on his or the way it felt to be the outsider looking in on a life that had once been partly hers.

This was going to be harder than she thought.

---

By the time school ended at 3:15, Sophia was mentally exhausted.

She'd survived History (boring but manageable), Chemistry (actually interesting), and one more period of people looking at her like she was a puzzle they couldn't solve. Now she just wanted to go home, hide in her room, and pretend this day had never happened.

Her phone buzzed as she was walking out.

**Ethan: Hey, are you okay? You left lunch kind of suddenly.**

Sophia stared at the message. She could ignore it. She could make an excuse. She could tell him the truth: that seeing him with his perfect girlfriend and his perfect friends made her feel like the lonely nine-year-old she'd been when he left.

Instead she typed: **Fine. Just overwhelmed. First day stuff.**

The response came immediately: **Totally get it. Listen, I meant what I said about showing you around. No pressure, but if you want to grab coffee or something this week, let me know. Would be good to actually catch up.**

Sophia sat down on a bench outside the main entrance and read the message three times.

He wanted to catch up. He was reaching out. Maybe he did remember their friendship. Maybe it mattered to him too.

Or maybe he just felt obligated because they used to know each other and he was a nice person who helped new students.

She didn't know which was worse.

**Sophia: Maybe. I'll let you know.**

**Ethan: Cool. See you in calc tomorrow.**

She put her phone away and started the twelve-minute walk home, trying to organize her thoughts into something coherent.

Facts:
1. Ethan Price remembered her.
2. He seemed genuinely happy to see her.
3. He had a girlfriend.
4. He had a whole life here that didn't include her.
5. She still felt the same flutter in her chest when he smiled at her that she'd felt at nine years old, which was problematic on multiple levels.

Conclusion: This situation required careful management. Minimal emotional investment. Protective distance.

She was so busy constructing emotional defense mechanisms that she almost didn't notice the sign on the building she was passing:

**Winnipeg Badminton Club - Open Training Sessions - All Levels Welcome**

Sophia stopped. She hadn't played badminton all summer—the move had disrupted her training schedule, and she'd told herself she'd get back to it once they settled. But maybe what she needed was something that was just hers. Something that had nothing to do with Ethan or high school social dynamics or feeling like she didn't belong.

She pulled out her phone and took a photo of the address.

Tomorrow, maybe. Or this weekend. Whenever she felt ready to be someone other than "the new girl" or "Ethan's friend from elementary school."

Just Sophia. Playing badminton. Finding her own balance.

But even as she thought it, she knew it wasn't that simple. Because Ethan was here, in Winnipeg, at her school, in her calculus class. And she couldn't avoid him even if she wanted to.

Which she didn't. And that was the real problem.

She made it home, survived dinner with her parents ("How was your first day?" "Fine." "Did you make any friends?" "Not really." "Give it time, honey."), and retreated to her room to do homework she couldn't focus on.

Her phone buzzed again at 9:47.

**Ethan: One more thing - there's a hockey game Friday night. Season opener. You should come. If you want. No pressure.**

Sophia stared at the message for a full minute.

Going to his hockey game felt like crossing a line. Felt like admitting she wanted to be part of his world. Felt dangerous.

But she was already typing: **Maybe. I'll think about it.**

**Ethan: Cool. It's at Bell MTS Iceplex, 7pm. I can save you a ticket if you decide.**

**Sophia: We'll see.**

**Ethan: :) Good night, Soph.**

**Sophia: Night.**

She put her phone face-down on her nightstand and lay in the dark, staring at the ceiling.

Forces in equilibrium. Net force equals zero.

But that was impossible now. Ethan Price had reentered her life, and every calculation she'd ever made about how to survive high school had just become completely useless.

She was going to go to that game. She knew it already, even though she was trying to pretend she didn't.

She was going to watch him play hockey in front of crowds and scouts and a future that was already written. And she was going to have to figure out how to be happy for him while simultaneously protecting her heart from wanting things that weren't hers to want.

The question was whether she was brave enough to try.

Sophia closed her eyes and tried to sleep, but all she could see was nine-year-old Ethan teaching her crossovers, saying *think of it like a double helix*, making her laugh when she fell.

Eight years ago, she'd lost her best friend.

Now he was back, and she had no idea what that meant.

But she was going to find out.
