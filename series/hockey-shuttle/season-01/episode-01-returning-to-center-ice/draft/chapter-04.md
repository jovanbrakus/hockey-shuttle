# Chapter 4: Game Night

## Friday, September 9th - Bell MTS Iceplex

Sophia almost chickened out seventeen times.

She was standing in her bedroom at 5:47 PM, wearing jeans and a navy sweater that she'd changed into and out of three times, trying to convince herself this was a normal thing to do. Go to a hockey game. Support an old friend. No big deal.

Except it was a big deal. Because going to Ethan's hockey game felt like a declaration: *I'm part of your life. I care about this. You matter to me.*

And all of that was true, which made it terrifying.

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: You still coming? No pressure if you changed your mind.**

She could back out. Say she felt sick. That her parents needed her home. That she'd forgotten about prior commitments.

Instead she typed: **On my way. Be there by 6:30.**

**Ethan: Awesome. Meet me at the main entrance—I'll leave a pass for you.**

Sophia grabbed her jacket and headed downstairs, where her father was reading in the living room.

"I'm going to a hockey game," she announced.

He looked up, surprised. "A hockey game?"

"Ethan invited me. Season opener."

Her father's expression shifted to something knowing. "Ethan Price. Your friend from Millbrook."

"Yes."

"The one who moved here for hockey. Who's now apparently very good at hockey."

"Dad."

"I'm just observing." He closed his book. "Do you need a ride?"

"I can walk. It's only twenty minutes."

"It'll be dark when the game ends."

"Then I'll text you."

He studied her for a moment, and Sophia braced herself for the lecture about being careful or not getting too attached or maintaining focus on academics. But instead he just said, "Have fun, kiddo. It's nice that you're reconnecting with old friends."

The walk to Bell MTS Iceplex gave Sophia too much time to overthink. The arena was massive—a serious facility that hosted WHL games and training camps. This wasn't the community rink in Millbrook with its ancient Zamboni and hand-painted boards. This was where real hockey happened.

The parking lot was already filling up when she arrived at 6:28. Cars disgorging families and teenagers and serious-looking adults with clipboards. Sophia felt underdressed and out of place.

The main entrance was crowded, but she spotted Ethan immediately. He was standing near the ticket booth in full gear except for his helmet, talking to an older couple who were probably someone's parents. When he saw her, his whole face changed.

"Soph!" He excused himself and jogged over. "You made it!"

"I said I would."

"I know, but—" He seemed genuinely relieved. "I'm glad. Come on, I have your pass."

He led her to the will-call window and picked up a ticket, plus a laminated pass on a lanyard. "This is a player guest pass. It gets you into the pre-game if you want, and down to the locker room area after. If you want," he added quickly. "No pressure."

Sophia took the pass, feeling its weight. "Pre-game?"

"Yeah, we do warm-ups from 6:35 to 6:50. Some people like watching. But you can also just go find your seat—I left you a ticket in section 104, behind our bench. Good view."

"I'll watch warm-ups."

Another smile, bright and genuine. "Cool. Follow me."

He led her through a side entrance, down a hallway that smelled like ice and rubber and ambition. They passed other players heading to the locker room, coaches reviewing plays on tablets, a woman who might have been a scout making notes on her phone.

"This is intense," Sophia said.

"Season opener. Everyone's watching." Ethan's voice had shifted to something more focused. "Scouts, parents, coaches from other teams. First chance to see how the season's going to shape up."

"Are you nervous?"

"Terrified." He said it lightly, but she could see the tension in his shoulders. "But Coach says nerves are good. Means you care."

They emerged into the arena itself, and Sophia stopped. The ice was perfect—glossy and smooth under the bright lights. The boards were professional, the penalty boxes pristine, the scoreboard digital and huge. This was worlds away from Millbrook.

"Pretty nice, right?" Ethan was watching her reaction. "This is actually where the Jets do some of their training camps. We're lucky to play here."

"It's beautiful."

"Yeah." He pulled on his helmet. "Okay, I need to get out there. Stay warm—it gets cold near the ice. And Soph?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for coming. Really. It means a lot."

Then he was gone, skating out onto the ice with his team, and Sophia was left standing there trying to process what just happened.

She found a spot near the glass to watch warm-ups. The team was running drills—skating patterns, passing sequences, shots on goal. They moved with precision that came from thousands of hours of practice, and even Sophia could see the hierarchy: some players were good, others were better, and then there was Ethan.

He was different on the ice. Faster, more fluid, completely in control. When he had the puck, everyone else adjusted to him. When he shot, the goalie had to work to stop it. He made hockey look effortless and inevitable.

"You must be Sophia."

A woman had appeared beside her—mid-forties, kind face, wearing a St. Paul's Hockey jacket. "I'm Mrs. Hayes, Tyler's mom. Ethan said to look out for you."

"Hi. Yeah, I'm Sophia."

"First time watching St. Paul's play?"

"First time watching any hockey in a long time."

Mrs. Hayes smiled. "Well, you picked a good game. Season opener against Fort Richmond—they're our biggest rivals. Should be exciting." She gestured to the ice. "Ethan's been talking about you all week. Says you two were friends back in Millbrook."

"When we were kids, yeah."

"He was so happy when he found out you'd moved here. Kept telling Tyler about how you used to skate together, how you were the smartest kid in school."

Sophia didn't know what to do with that information. "He was the smartest kid in school."

"Maybe you both were." Mrs. Hayes checked her watch. "I should get to my seat—I'm helping with the booster club table tonight. But come find me after if you need anything, okay? Anyone who's important to Ethan is important to us."

She left, and Sophia stood there processing. He'd been talking about her. He'd been happy she'd moved here. He'd told people she mattered.

The warm-ups ended, and the teams retreated to their locker rooms. Sophia made her way to section 104, finding her seat—fourth row, perfect view of the bench and ice. The arena was filling up fast, hundreds of people settling in with popcorn and programs and team scarves.

She pulled out her phone.

**Maya: How's the hockey game?**

**Sophia: Hasn't started yet. Nervous.**

**Maya: For him or for you?**

**Sophia: Both? I don't know.**

**Maya: Just remember—badminton is still cooler than hockey. ;)**

**Sophia: Obviously.**

The lights dimmed, and music started playing. The announcer's voice boomed through the speakers: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bell MTS Iceplex for tonight's season opener! Please welcome your St. Paul's Crusaders!"

The team skated out onto the ice in a line, and the crowd went wild. Sophia watched Ethan emerge with his teammates, watched him take his position for the national anthem, and felt something shift in her chest.

This was his world. This was what he'd been training for since he was nine years old. This was the dream his parents had sacrificed for, the future everyone expected from him.

And he'd invited her to witness it.

The puck dropped at 7:04 PM.

---

Sophia had watched hockey on TV a handful of times. She knew the basic rules—get the puck in the net, don't fight too much, something about offsides. But watching live was completely different.

The speed was incredible. The players moved faster than seemed physically possible, the puck a blur between sticks. Bodies crashed into boards with sounds that made her wince. The noise was overwhelming—skates on ice, sticks slapping, coaches yelling, crowd roaring.

And Ethan was everywhere.

He played center—she'd figured that out from the starting lineup. Which meant he was in the middle of everything, taking face-offs, controlling play, creating opportunities. Within the first five minutes, he'd set up two scoring chances and stolen the puck from Fort Richmond's best player.

"He's having a good night," the man next to her commented. "Price is always good, but tonight he's on."

By the end of the first period, St. Paul's was up 2-0, and both goals had Ethan's fingerprints on them. The first was his assist—a perfect pass across the slot that Tyler buried. The second he scored himself, a wrist shot that went bar-down so fast the goalie never moved.

During the intermission, Sophia checked her phone.

**Ethan: How bored are you?**

**Sophia: Not bored. You're really good.**

**Ethan: We're winning, that helps. Still nervous though.**

**Sophia: Why? You're dominating.**

**Ethan: Scouts. There's at least three here. Coach pointed them out.**

**Sophia: So show them why they should care.**

**Ethan: Yes ma'am. :)**

The second period was harder. Fort Richmond came out aggressive, scoring two quick goals to tie it up. The game got physical—lots of hits, a few penalties, escalating tension. Sophia found herself on her feet without meaning to, watching every play with her heart in her throat.

Ethan got checked hard into the boards midway through the period and went down. Sophia's stomach dropped. But he was up seconds later, skating back to the bench, waving off the trainer. When he returned for his next shift, he played harder, faster, like the hit had energized him rather than slowed him down.

With three minutes left in the period, St. Paul's scored on a power play. Then again thirty seconds later. By the time the buzzer sounded, they were up 4-2, and the momentum had completely shifted.

The third period was electric. Fort Richmond pulled their goalie for an extra attacker with two minutes left, desperate to tie it up. The crowd was on their feet, screaming. Sophia's hands were clenched into fists without her realizing.

Ethan won a face-off in his own zone, passed to Tyler, who sent it up to their right wing, who shot it the length of the ice into the empty net.

5-2. Game over.

The final buzzer sounded, and the team poured off the bench to celebrate. Sophia watched Ethan hug his teammates, watched the pure joy on his face, and felt something warm and complicated spread through her chest.

This was happiness. Not for herself, but for him. He'd worked his entire life for moments like this, and watching him celebrate felt like being part of something bigger.

The arena slowly emptied as people filed out, but Sophia stayed in her seat, not quite ready to leave. Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Meet me at the main entrance in 20 min? Want to introduce you to some people.**

**Sophia: Okay.**

She made her way down to the main entrance, which was still crowded with parents and players and people congratulating the team. She stood off to the side, trying not to be in the way.

"Sophia!" Mrs. Hayes appeared again. "What did you think?"

"It was incredible. Ethan was amazing."

"He really was. Best I've seen him play in months." She lowered her voice. "Between you and me, I think having you here helped. He's been so stressed about scouts and expectations. Maybe having a friend here who remembers him from before all this—maybe that helped him just play."

Before Sophia could respond, the locker room doors opened and players started emerging in street clothes, hair wet from showers, equipment bags over shoulders. Parents and friends swarmed them with congratulations.

Ethan appeared, laughing at something Tyler was saying. He'd changed into jeans and a hoodie, and his hair was messy from being towel-dried, and Sophia thought distantly that this wasn't fair. He wasn't supposed to look like that. He wasn't supposed to make her heart stutter.

Then he saw her and his expression changed—softened into something that was just for her.

"Hey." He made his way through the crowd. "You stayed."

"You asked me to."

"Yeah, but—I thought you might bail. It's late and you don't know anyone and—" He shook his head. "Never mind. Come here, I want you to meet people."

He led her over to a group of his teammates. "Guys, this is Sophia. Friend from Millbrook. Sophia, this is the team—you know Tyler, that's Marcus, Jamie, Connor, and Alex."

They all greeted her with varying degrees of interest and friendliness. Tyler was the most welcoming, probably because his mom had already briefed him.

"So you're the famous Sophia," he said, grinning. "Price hasn't shut up about you all week."

Ethan elbowed him. "Shut up."

"I'm just saying! 'Sophia this, Sophia that, did you know Sophia came in third at math competition in fourth grade—'"

"I'm going to murder you."

The team laughed, and Sophia felt her face heat. But it wasn't uncomfortable, exactly. Just overwhelming.

"You played a great game," she said to Ethan, partly to change the subject.

"Thanks. It felt good." He glanced at his teammates. "Give us a minute?"

They drifted away, and suddenly it was just the two of them in a corner of the lobby, the crowd flowing around them like water around stones.

"So," Ethan said. "Honest opinion. Was it completely boring?"

"Are you kidding? It was incredible. You were incredible."

"I had a good night."

"You had a great night. That goal in the first period—I don't even know how you saw that angle."

"Just saw where the goalie's weight was. He was leaning glove-side, so I went blocker." He said it like it was obvious, like reading a goalie at full speed was something anyone could do. "Did you really have fun? You're not just saying that?"

"I really had fun. It was..." Sophia searched for the right words. "It was like watching you speak a different language. One you're completely fluent in."

Ethan smiled. "That's exactly what it feels like sometimes. Like everything makes sense on the ice in a way it doesn't anywhere else."

"Must be nice."

"It is. But it's also—" He broke off. "Sorry, I'm not making sense. Post-game adrenaline."

"You're making perfect sense."

They stood there for a moment, just looking at each other, and Sophia felt the air between them change. Become charged with something she couldn't name.

"Ethan!" Becca appeared, breaking the moment. She threw her arms around him, and he hugged her back automatically. "You were amazing! That second goal was perfect!"

"Thanks, Becs."

"Hi Sophia." Becca's smile was friendly but distant. "Did you enjoy the game?"

"Yeah. It was great."

"Isn't he incredible?" Becca was still holding onto Ethan's arm. "I keep telling him he's going to be playing in the NHL before he knows it."

"Yeah," Sophia said quietly. "He's pretty incredible."

"We're all going to Mickey's for pizza," Becca continued. "Celebration dinner. You should come!"

But the invitation felt obligatory, and Sophia could read the subtext: *This is his girlfriend. This is his life. You're just visiting.*

"I should get home," Sophia said. "It's late."

"Are you sure?" Ethan looked disappointed. "It's just pizza."

"I'm sure. But congratulations on the win. Really."

"Let me at least walk you out."

"I'm fine—"

"Soph. It's dark and you walked here. I'm walking you out."

Becca's expression flickered with something—annoyance? confusion?—but she smiled. "I'll save you a seat, babe."

Ethan nodded, and they headed for the exit.

Outside, the September air was cool and crisp, carrying the first hint of autumn. The parking lot was half-empty now, cars pulling out in streams of headlights.

"You really don't have to walk me anywhere," Sophia said. "I can text my dad for a ride."

"I want to." Ethan shoved his hands in his hoodie pocket. "That was intense in there. The team, Becca, everyone wanting something. I needed a minute."

"To breathe?"

"Yeah."

They walked in silence for a bit, their footsteps echoing in the parking lot.

"Can I ask you something?" Sophia said finally.

"Always."

"Do you actually want to go to that pizza place? Or are you doing it because everyone expects you to?"

Ethan stopped walking. Looked at her with an expression she couldn't quite read. "You see right through me, don't you?"

"I remember you. The real you, under all the performance."

"Sophia Chen, human lie detector." But he said it fondly. "Honestly? I'm exhausted. I want to go home, eat something quiet, maybe watch a movie. But that's not—that's not what the captain of the hockey team does after a season-opener win."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm supposed to be the leader. The guy everyone rallies around. If I skip the celebration, it looks like I don't care about the team."

"But you scored two goals and set up three others. I think they know you care."

He laughed softly. "Maybe. But it's complicated."

"Most things are."

They'd reached the edge of the parking lot, where a path led toward residential streets. Sophia pulled out her phone to text her dad, but Ethan stopped her.

"Wait. One more thing."

"What?"

He seemed to be gathering courage, which was strange because Ethan Price didn't seem like someone who needed courage for anything. "I just—I wanted to say thank you. For coming tonight. For being here."

"You already said thank you."

"I know. But I mean it differently now." He ran a hand through his still-damp hair. "Having you in the stands... I don't know. It felt different. Good different. Like I was playing for someone who knew me before I was 'Ethan Price, hockey player.' Someone who knew me when I was just... me."

Sophia's heart was doing complicated things again. "You're still you."

"Am I?" He looked at her intently. "Sometimes I'm not sure. I've spent so many years being what everyone needs me to be—the star player, the good son, the reliable boyfriend, the team captain. I don't know if there's any 'just me' left."

"There is." She said it with certainty. "I saw him today at The Forks, talking about engineering. And just now, saying you'd rather watch a movie than go to a loud pizza place. He's still there."

"You've been here less than a week and you already see things no one else does."

"Maybe everyone else isn't looking."

The moment stretched between them, heavy with things neither of them could say. Then Ethan's phone buzzed—probably Becca wondering where he was—and reality crashed back.

"I should let you go," Sophia said. "Your team's waiting."

"Yeah. Yeah, they are." But he didn't move. "Soph?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm really glad you're here. In Winnipeg, I mean. At St. Paul's. In my life again." He said it quietly, intensely, like it was the most important thing in the world. "I didn't realize how much I missed having someone who actually knows me until you showed up."

Sophia didn't trust her voice, so she just nodded.

"I'll see you Monday?" he continued. "In calc?"

"Monday. In calc."

"Cool. And maybe—if you want—we could study together sometime? For the first test? Like old times?"

"Old times we were studying multiplication tables."

"Derivatives are basically fancy multiplication." He smiled, and it was the smile she remembered from childhood—unguarded and genuine. "Think about it?"

"I'll think about it."

"Good night, Soph."

"Good night."

She watched him walk back toward the arena, back toward his team and his girlfriend and his carefully constructed life. Then she pulled out her phone and texted her dad for a ride.

While she waited, standing under a streetlight in an empty parking lot, Sophia tried to organize her thoughts into something coherent.

Facts:
1. Ethan Price was still the same person she'd known at nine—just buried under expectations and performance.
2. He valued her presence in a way that felt significant.
3. He had a girlfriend he'd been with for over a year.
4. Sophia's feelings were becoming increasingly complicated and dangerous.
5. This was going to hurt. Eventually, inevitably, this was going to hurt.

She thought about forces and equilibrium and Newton's laws of motion. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

But what happened when the external force was your own heart?

Her dad's car pulled up, and she climbed in.

"Good game?" he asked.

"Yeah. Really good."

"And Ethan? How is he?"

Sophia looked out the window at the city lights streaming past. "He's... he's exactly who I remembered. And completely different. And I think I'm in trouble."

Her father glanced at her but had the wisdom not to ask follow-up questions.

At home, Sophia lay in bed staring at the ceiling, replaying the night. The game, the conversation in the parking lot, the way Ethan had looked at her when he said *I'm really glad you're here.*

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Made it home. Pizza was loud and terrible, you made the right call.**

**Sophia: Told you.**

**Ethan: You did. You're smart like that.**

A pause. Then:

**Ethan: Hey, I meant what I said earlier. About being glad you're here. I know we were just kids before, and eight years is a long time, but... I don't know. Feels like no time passed at all. Like we just picked up where we left off.**

**Sophia: Except now we're solving derivatives instead of multiplication.**

**Ethan: Exactly. Same but different. Better, maybe.**

Sophia stared at that message for a long time. Better. He thought having her here was better.

**Sophia: Get some sleep. You played hard tonight.**

**Ethan: Yes ma'am. See you Monday, Soph.**

She put her phone on her nightstand and closed her eyes, but sleep was impossible. Because tonight had changed something fundamental, shifted the ground beneath her in ways she couldn't quite name.

She'd moved to Winnipeg expecting to be lonely. Expected to spend two years as an outsider, counting down until college.

But then Ethan Price had walked back into her life, and suddenly everything was complicated and confusing and terrifying and wonderful all at once.

He had a girlfriend. He had a future mapped out. He had a life that didn't have space for someone like her—someone who would question his choices and see through his performance and remind him of who he used to be.

But he'd invited her to his game. He'd walked her out to the parking lot. He'd told her she mattered.

And now Sophia had to figure out what to do with that information.

She thought about nine-year-old Ethan teaching her crossovers, making her laugh, understanding her in ways no one else did. She thought about seventeen-year-old Ethan on the ice tonight, completely in his element, brilliant and untouchable.

She thought about the moment in the parking lot when he'd looked at her and said *I don't know if there's any 'just me' left* and she'd seen straight through to the boy she remembered.

Forces in equilibrium. Net force equals zero.

But nothing about this was balanced. Everything was tilting, accelerating, heading toward an outcome she couldn't predict but could feel approaching like an inevitable collision.

Sophia pulled her blanket tighter and admitted the truth to herself, there in the dark where no one could hear:

She was falling for Ethan Price.

Again.

Still.

Maybe she'd never stopped.

And he was with someone else, and this was going to hurt, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.

But she was going to see him Monday in calc. She was going to sit three rows behind him and try not to stare at the back of his neck. She was going to agree to study together because she was weak and she missed him and she wanted to be near him even if it destroyed her.

She was going to let herself care about someone who wasn't hers to care about.

And maybe—just maybe—that would be enough.

Or maybe it would break her heart.

Either way, there was no going back now.

The season had begun, and Sophia Chen was all in.

## Sunday Morning - September 11th

Sophia was lying in bed at 11 AM, having successfully avoided human interaction all weekend, when her phone rang.

Not texted. Called. Which was alarming because no one their age actually called.

She checked the screen: Ethan.

"Hello?"

"Hey!" He sounded cheerful, energized. "What are you doing?"

"Currently? Trying to decide if I'm getting up today."

"Get up. I'm taking you skating."

Sophia sat bolt upright. "What?"

"Skating. Remember skating? Frozen water, metal blades, physics in action?"

"I remember what skating is. I haven't skated in eight years."

"Perfect. Time to fix that. I'm picking you up in an hour."

"Ethan—"

"One hour, Soph. Dress warm."

He hung up before she could protest.

Sophia stared at her phone, processing. Ethan Price had just invited her—no, told her—they were going skating. On a Sunday morning. After his season opener two days ago.

This was a terrible idea.

This was the best idea ever.

She got up and started looking for clothes.

Exactly one hour later, his truck pulled up outside. Sophia climbed in, and he grinned at her.

"Ready?"

"I'm going to fall constantly and embarrass myself."

"Probably. But that's half the fun."

He drove them to a small outdoor rink near Assiniboine Park—nothing fancy, just a community rink with wooden boards and a warming house. It was almost empty, just a few families with young kids wobbling around.

"This is where I used to come when I first moved here," Ethan said, pulling skates out of his truck. "Before AAA and elite training and all that. When it was still just... fun."

"Why'd you stop?"

"Got too serious too fast, I guess." He handed her a pair of women's skates. "These were my mom's. They should fit."

Sophia laced up the skates, and the moment her feet settled into them, muscle memory kicked in. Her body remembered this—the slight forward lean, the way your weight distributed, the anticipation of ice.

They stepped onto the rink, and Sophia immediately wobbled.

Ethan caught her elbow, laughing. "Easy. Give it a second."

"I told you I'd be terrible."

"You're not terrible. You're just out of practice."

He skated backward in front of her, holding both her hands, pulling her slowly across the ice. Just like he'd done when they were nine.

"There you go," he said. "Feel it coming back?"

"Maybe."

They made slow circuits around the rink. Sophia fell twice—once on her own, once because a toddler cut in front of her—and both times Ethan helped her up, patient and encouraging.

After about twenty minutes, her body really did remember. Her ankles remembered how to hold steady. Her legs remembered how to push and glide. Her arms remembered how to balance.

"Okay," Ethan said. "Now try a crossover."

"Absolutely not."

"Come on. For old times' sake."

"I'll die."

"You won't die. Front foot pushes under, back foot comes around and over. Remember? Double helix."

Sophia took a breath and tried. She made it three steps before losing the pattern and having to stop.

"Better!" Ethan circled around her. "Again."

She tried again. And again. And on the fourth try, she made it halfway around the rink.

"YES!" Ethan was grinning like she'd just won Olympic gold. "You did it!"

"I did it," she echoed, surprised and delighted.

"Now race me."

"I'll lose."

"Obviously. But race me anyway."

They raced to the blue line, and Sophia did lose, but it didn't matter. What mattered was the cold air and the scrape of blades and the sound of Ethan's laugh when she tried to trip him at the finish line.

What mattered was that for this one morning, they were nine years old again, and nothing was complicated yet.

They skated until Sophia's legs ached and her face hurt from smiling. In the warming house afterward, drinking hot chocolate from a vending machine, she felt more herself than she had since the move.

"Thank you," she said. "For this."

"Thank you for coming." Ethan wrapped his hands around his cup. "I needed this. Just... being normal for a minute."

"This is normal for you?"

"This is who I wish I could be more often. Just some guy skating on a Sunday morning. Not the star player, not the NHL prospect. Just... Ethan."

Sophia understood completely. Because right now, she wasn't the new girl or the math nerd or the badminton player trying to fit in. She was just Soph, skating with her best friend.

Except he wasn't just her best friend anymore. And she wasn't just anything.

They were something undefined and fragile and important, and Sophia had no idea what to do with it except hold on and hope it didn't break.

---

That night, lying in bed, Sophia admitted the final truth:

She was in love with Ethan Price.

Maybe she'd never stopped. Maybe she'd been in love with him at nine years old and just didn't have the vocabulary for it yet.

And he was with someone else, and this story didn't have a happy ending, but she couldn't make herself care.

Because today he'd taken her skating. He'd held her hands and taught her crossovers again and looked at her like she was the most important person in his world.

And for now—just for now—that was enough.

Even if it hurt later.

Even if this all fell apart.

For now, she had this: Ethan Price skating beside her, calling her Soph, reminding her what it felt like to be known.

And she was going to hold onto that for as long as she possibly could.

## Preview: Episode 2 - "Face-Off"

Coming Soon...

*As Sophia settles into St. Paul's, the lines between friendship and something more begin to blur. When Becca invites her to a group study session, Sophia must navigate the complicated dynamics of being close to Ethan while respecting his relationship. Meanwhile, badminton provincials approach, and Sophia discovers that competing while emotionally compromised is harder than any physics problem she's ever solved.*

*But everything shifts when Ethan's parents discover how much time he's spending with Sophia—and decide it's a distraction he can't afford.*

*Because when you're training for the NHL, you don't have time for complications.*

*And Sophia Chen is definitely a complication.*
