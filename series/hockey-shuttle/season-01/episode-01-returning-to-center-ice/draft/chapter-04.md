# Chapter 4: Game Night

## Friday, September 9th - Bell MTS Iceplex

Sophia stood in her bedroom at 5:47 PM, staring at her closet.

She'd already changed three times. Nothing felt right. Because this wasn't just going to a hockey game. This was going to *Ethan's* hockey game. Where his girlfriend would be. Where his whole life would be on display.

Navy henley. Safe. Familiar.

She grabbed it before she could overthink it more.

Her phone buzzed. **Ethan: You still coming? No pressure if you changed your mind.**

She could back out. Say she felt sick. That her parents needed her home. That she'd forgotten about prior commitments.

Instead she typed: **On my way. Be there by 6:30.**

**Ethan: Awesome. Meet me at the main entrance—I'll leave a pass for you.**

She headed downstairs before she could change her mind again.

Her father was in the living room, grading papers. "Going somewhere?"

"Hockey game. Ethan invited me."

He looked up, and something shifted in his expression. Recognition, maybe. Or concern. "Ethan Price. From Millbrook."

"Yeah."

"The one who moved here for hockey."

"Dad."

"I'm just observing." He closed his laptop. "Do you need a ride?"

"I can walk. It's only twenty minutes."

"Text me when the game ends. I'll come get you."

"Okay."

He studied her for a moment longer, and Sophia braced herself for the lecture about being careful or not getting too attached or maintaining focus on academics. But instead he just said, "Have fun, kiddo."

---

The walk to Bell MTS Iceplex gave Sophia too much time to overthink.

The arena was massive—a serious facility that hosted WHL games and professional training camps. This wasn't Millbrook Community Rink with its ancient Zamboni and hand-painted boards. This was where real hockey happened.

The parking lot was already filling up when she arrived at 6:28. Cars disgorging families and teenagers and serious-looking adults with clipboards. Scouts, maybe. People who mattered.

Sophia felt underdressed and out of place.

The main entrance was crowded, but she spotted Ethan immediately. He was in full gear except for his helmet, talking to an older couple, and when he saw her, his whole face changed.

"Soph!" He excused himself and jogged over, skates making that distinctive sound on the rubber matting. "You made it!"

"I said I would."

"I know, but—" He seemed genuinely relieved. "I'm glad. Come on, I have your pass."

He led her to the will-call window and picked up a ticket plus a laminated pass on a lanyard. "This is a player guest pass. Gets you into pre-game warm-ups if you want, and down to the locker room area after. If you want," he added quickly. "No pressure."

Sophia took the pass, feeling its weight against her chest. "Pre-game?"

"Yeah, we warm up from 6:35 to 6:50. Some people like watching. But you can also just go find your seat—section 104, behind our bench. Good view."

"I'll watch warm-ups."

Another smile, bright and genuine. "Cool. Follow me."

He led her through a side entrance, down a hallway that smelled like ice and rubber and decades of sweat. They passed other players heading to the locker room, coaches reviewing plays on tablets, a woman making notes on her phone who might have been a scout.

"This is intense," Sophia said.

"Season opener. Everyone's watching." Ethan's voice had shifted to something more focused, sharper. "Scouts, parents, coaches from other teams. First chance to see how the season shapes up."

"Are you nervous?"

"Terrified." He said it lightly, but she could see the tension in his jaw, his shoulders. "But Coach says nerves are good. Means you care."

They emerged into the arena itself, and Sophia stopped.

The ice was perfect—glossy and smooth under brilliant lights that made it glow. The boards were professional-grade, the penalty boxes pristine, the scoreboard massive and digital. The cold hit her face, familiar and sharp, carrying that specific smell of ice that she hadn't realized she'd missed.

"Pretty nice, right?" Ethan was watching her reaction. "This is where the Jets do some training camps. We're lucky to play here."

"It's beautiful."

"Yeah." He pulled on his helmet. "Okay, I need to get out there. You can watch from near the glass—it'll be cold, so..." He trailed off, looking like he wanted to say something else, then shook his head. "Thanks for coming. Really."

Then he was gone, skating out onto the ice with his team, and Sophia was left standing there trying to process what just happened.

She found a spot near the glass to watch warm-ups. The team ran through drills—skating patterns, passing sequences, shots on goal. They moved with precision that came from thousands of hours of practice.

And then there was Ethan.

He was different on the ice. Faster, more fluid, completely in control. When he had the puck, everyone else adjusted to him. When he passed, the puck went exactly where it needed to go. When he shot, even in warm-ups, the sound of it hitting the boards echoed through the arena.

"You must be Sophia."

A woman had appeared beside her—mid-forties, kind face, wearing a St. Paul's Hockey jacket. "I'm Mrs. Hayes, Tyler's mom. Ethan said to look out for you."

"Hi. Yeah, I'm Sophia."

"First time watching St. Paul's play?"

"First time watching any hockey in years, actually."

Mrs. Hayes smiled. "Well, you picked a good game. Season opener against Fort Richmond—they're our biggest rivals. Should be exciting." She gestured to the ice where Ethan was demonstrating something to a younger player. "Ethan's been talking about you all week. Says you two were friends back in Millbrook."

"When we were kids, yeah."

"He was so happy when he found out you'd moved here. Kept telling Tyler about how you used to skate together, how you were the smartest kid in school." Mrs. Hayes checked her watch. "I should get to my seat—I'm helping with the booster club table tonight. But come find me after if you need anything, okay? Anyone who's important to Ethan is important to us."

She left, and Sophia stood there processing. *He'd been talking about her. He'd been happy she'd moved here.*

The warm-ups ended, and the teams retreated to their locker rooms. Sophia made her way to section 104, finding her seat—fourth row, dead center, perfect view of the bench and ice. The arena was filling up fast, hundreds of people settling in with popcorn and programs and team scarves.

She pulled out her phone to text her dad that she'd arrived safely, and noticed Maya had texted.

**Maya: How's the hockey game?**

**Sophia: Hasn't started yet. Nervous.**

**Maya: For him or for you?**

**Sophia: Both?**

**Maya: Just remember—badminton is still cooler than hockey. ;)**

**Sophia: Obviously.**

The lights dimmed. Music started playing. The announcer's voice boomed through the speakers: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bell MTS Iceplex for tonight's season opener! Please welcome your St. Paul's Crusaders!"

The team skated out in a line, and the crowd went wild. Sophia watched Ethan emerge with his teammates, watched him take his position for the national anthem, and felt something shift in her chest.

This was his world. What he'd been training for since he was nine years old. The dream his parents had sacrificed for, the future everyone expected from him.

And he'd invited her to witness it.

The puck dropped at 7:04 PM.

---

Sophia had watched hockey on TV a handful of times, knew the basic rules. But watching live was completely different.

The speed. The sound of bodies hitting boards. The puck disappearing and reappearing. The crowd noise washing over everything in waves.

And Ethan was everywhere.

He played center, which meant he was in the middle of everything. Taking face-offs, controlling play, creating opportunities. Within the first five minutes, he'd set up two scoring chances and stolen the puck from Fort Richmond's best player twice.

"He's having a good night," the man next to her commented to his companion. "Price is always good, but tonight he's on."

By the end of the first period, St. Paul's was up 2-0. The first goal came off Ethan's assist—a perfect pass across the slot that Tyler buried top shelf. The second he scored himself, a wrist shot that went bar-down so fast the goalie never moved.

The crowd was on their feet. Sophia found herself standing too, heart pounding, watching Ethan celebrate with his team.

During the intermission, her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: How bored are you?**

**Sophia: Not bored. You're really good.**

**Ethan: We're winning, that helps. Still nervous though. Three scouts here.**

**Sophia: So show them why they should care.**

**Ethan: Yes ma'am. :)**

The second period was harder. Fort Richmond came out aggressive, scoring two quick goals to tie it up. The game got physical—lots of hits, a few penalties, escalating tension. Sophia found herself on her feet without meaning to, watching every play with her hands clenched.

Ethan got checked hard into the boards midway through the period and went down.

Time seemed to slow—the sound of the hit echoing, Ethan sprawled on the ice, everyone in the arena holding their breath.

But he was up seconds later, skating back to the bench, waving off the trainer. When he returned for his next shift, he played harder, faster, like the hit had energized him.

With three minutes left in the period, St. Paul's scored on a power play. Then again thirty seconds later. By the time the buzzer sounded, they were up 4-2, and the momentum had completely shifted.

The third period was electric. Fort Richmond pulled their goalie with two minutes left, desperate to tie. The crowd was on their feet, screaming. Sophia's hands were clenched into fists.

Ethan won a face-off in his own zone, passed to Tyler, who sent it up to their right wing, who shot it the length of the ice into the empty net.

5-2. Game over.

The final buzzer sounded, and the team poured off the bench to celebrate. Sophia watched Ethan hug his teammates, watched the pure joy on his face, and felt something warm and complicated spread through her chest.

This was happiness. Not for herself, but for him. Pride mixed with something sharper, more dangerous. He'd worked his entire life for moments like this, and watching him celebrate felt like being part of something bigger than both of them.

The arena slowly emptied. Sophia stayed in her seat, not quite ready to leave. Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Meet me at main entrance in 20? Want to introduce you to some people.**

**Sophia: Okay.**

She made her way down, navigating through the thinning crowd. The main entrance was still busy with parents and players and people congratulating the team. She stood off to the side, trying not to be in the way.

"Sophia!" Mrs. Hayes appeared. "What did you think?"

"It was incredible. Ethan was amazing."

"He really was. Best I've seen him play in months." She lowered her voice. "Between you and me, I think having you here helped. He's been so stressed about scouts and expectations lately. Maybe having a friend here who remembers him from before all this—maybe that helped him just play."

Before Sophia could respond, the locker room doors opened and players started emerging in street clothes, hair wet from showers, equipment bags over shoulders. Parents and friends swarmed them with congratulations.

Ethan appeared, laughing at something Tyler was saying. He'd changed into jeans and a hoodie, his hair messy from being towel-dried, and Sophia thought distantly that this wasn't fair. He wasn't supposed to look like that. Wasn't supposed to make her heart stutter.

Then he saw her and his expression changed—softened into something that was just for her.

"Hey." He made his way through the crowd. "You stayed."

"You asked me to."

"Yeah, but I thought you might bail. It's late and you don't know anyone and—" He shook his head. "Never mind. Come here, I want you to meet people."

He led her over to a group of his teammates. "Guys, this is Sophia. Friend from Millbrook. Sophia, this is the team—you know Tyler, that's Marcus, Jamie, Connor, and Alex."

They all greeted her with varying degrees of interest and friendliness. Tyler was the most welcoming.

"So you're the famous Sophia," he said, grinning. "Price hasn't shut up about you all week."

Ethan elbowed him. "Shut up."

"I'm just saying! 'Sophia this, Sophia that, did you know Sophia came in third at math competition in fourth grade—'"

"I'm going to murder you."

The team laughed, and Sophia felt her face heat. But it wasn't uncomfortable, exactly. Just overwhelming.

"You played a great game," she said to Ethan, partly to change the subject.

"Thanks. It felt good." He glanced at his teammates. "Give us a minute?"

They drifted away, and suddenly it was just the two of them in a corner of the lobby, the crowd flowing around them like water around stones.

"So," Ethan said. "Honest opinion. Was it completely boring?"

"Are you kidding? It was incredible. You were incredible."

"I had a good night."

"You had a great night. That goal in the first period—I don't even know how you saw that angle."

"Just read where the goalie's weight was. He was leaning glove-side, so I went blocker." He said it like it was obvious, like reading a goalie at full speed was something anyone could do. "Did you really have fun? You're not just saying that?"

"I really had fun. It was..." Sophia searched for the right words. "It was like watching you speak a different language. One you're completely fluent in."

Ethan smiled. "That's exactly what it feels like sometimes. Like everything makes sense on the ice in a way it doesn't anywhere else."

They stood there for a moment, just looking at each other, and Sophia felt the air between them change. Become charged with something she couldn't name but could definitely feel.

"Ethan!" Becca appeared, breaking the moment. She threw her arms around him, and he hugged her back automatically. "You were amazing! That second goal was perfect!"

"Thanks, Becs."

"Hi Sophia." Becca's smile was friendly but distant. The smile of someone being polite to her boyfriend's acquaintance. "Did you enjoy the game?"

"Yeah. It was great."

"Isn't he incredible?" Becca was still holding onto Ethan's arm, a casual gesture that screamed ownership. "I keep telling him he's going to be in the NHL before he knows it."

"Yeah," Sophia said quietly. "He's pretty incredible."

"We're all going to Mickey's for pizza," Becca continued. "Celebration dinner. You should come!"

But the invitation felt obligatory, and Sophia could read the subtext: *This is his girlfriend. This is his life. You're just visiting.*

"I should get home," Sophia said. "It's late. My dad's expecting me."

"Are you sure?" Ethan looked disappointed. "It's just pizza."

"I'm sure. But congratulations on the win. Really. You were..." She trailed off, not trusting herself to finish the sentence without revealing too much.

"Let me at least walk you out."

"I'm fine—"

"Soph. It's dark and you're waiting for your dad. I'm walking you out."

Becca's expression flickered with something—annoyance? confusion?—but she smiled. "I'll save you a seat, babe."

Ethan nodded, and they headed for the exit.

---

Outside, the September night was cool and crisp, carrying that first real bite of autumn. The parking lot was half-empty now, cars pulling out in streams of headlights and brake lights.

"You really don't have to wait with me," Sophia said. "I already texted my dad. He'll be here in like five minutes."

"I want to." Ethan shoved his hands in his hoodie pocket. "That was intense in there. The team, Becca, everyone wanting something. I needed a minute."

"To breathe?"

"Yeah."

They walked slowly toward the edge of the parking lot where the designated pickup area was. The sounds of the arena—voices, car engines, celebration—faded slightly.

"Can I ask you something?" Sophia said finally.

"Always."

"Do you actually want to go to that pizza place? Or are you doing it because everyone expects you to?"

Ethan stopped walking. Looked at her. "You see right through me, don't you?"

"I remember you. The real you, under all the performance."

"Sophia Chen, human lie detector." But he said it fondly. "Honestly? I'm exhausted. I want to go home, eat something quiet, maybe watch a movie. But that's not what the captain of the hockey team does after a season-opener win."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm supposed to be the leader. The guy everyone rallies around. If I skip the celebration, it looks like I don't care about the team."

"But you scored one goal and assisted on three others. I think they know you care."

He laughed softly. "Maybe. But it's complicated. Everything's always complicated."

"Most things are."

They'd reached the pickup area. A few other people were waiting, checking phones, scanning for headlights. Sophia pulled out her phone to check if her dad had texted an ETA, but Ethan stopped her.

"Wait. One more thing."

"What?"

"I just—I wanted to say thank you. For coming tonight. For being here."

"You already said thank you. Like three times."

"I know. But I mean it differently now." He ran a hand through his still-damp hair. "Having you in the stands... it felt different. Like I was playing for someone who knew me before all this. Someone who knew me when I was just... me."

Sophia's heart was doing complicated things again. "You're still you."

"Am I?" He looked at her intently, and in the parking lot lights his eyes were darker, more serious. "Sometimes I'm not sure. I've spent so many years being what everyone needs. The star player, the good son, the boyfriend, the captain. I don't know if there's any 'just me' left."

"There is." She said it with certainty. "I saw him at The Forks, talking about engineering. And just now, saying you'd rather watch a movie than go to a loud pizza place. He's still there."

"You've been here less than a week and you already see things no one else does."

"Maybe everyone else isn't looking."

The moment stretched between them, heavy with things neither of them could say. Then Ethan's phone buzzed—probably Becca wondering where he was—and the spell broke.

"I should let you go," Sophia said. "Your team's waiting."

"Yeah. Yeah, they are." But he didn't move. "Soph?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm really glad you're here. In Winnipeg, I mean. At St. Paul's. In my life again." He said it quietly, intensely, like it was the most important thing in the world. "I didn't realize how much I missed having someone who actually knows me until you showed up."

Sophia didn't trust her voice, so she just nodded.

"I'll see you Monday?" he continued. "In calc?"

"Monday. In calc."

Headlights swept across the parking lot—her father's car. Perfect timing before she could do something stupid like tell him how she felt.

"Good night, Soph."

"Good night."

She watched him walk back toward the arena, back toward his team and his girlfriend and his carefully constructed life. Then she climbed into her father's car.

"Good game?" he asked.

"Yeah. Really good."

"And Ethan? How is he?"

Sophia looked out the window at the city lights streaming past. "He's... he's exactly who I remembered. And completely different. And I think I'm in trouble."

Her father glanced at her but had the wisdom not to ask follow-up questions.

---

At home, Sophia went straight to her room, dropped her bag, and lay on her bed staring at the ceiling.

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Made it to pizza place. Loud and terrible, you made the right call.**

**Sophia: Told you.**

**Ethan: You did. You're smart like that.**

A pause. Then:

**Ethan: Hey, I meant what I said earlier. About being glad you're here. I know we were just kids before, and eight years is a long time, but... I don't know. Feels like no time passed at all.**

**Sophia: Except now we're solving derivatives instead of multiplication.**

**Ethan: Exactly. Same but different. Better, maybe.**

*Better.* He thought having her here was better.

**Sophia: Get some sleep. You played hard tonight.**

**Ethan: Yes ma'am. Good night, Soph.**

**Sophia: Night.**

She put her phone on her nightstand and closed her eyes, but sleep was impossible.

She'd moved to Winnipeg expecting to be lonely. Expected to spend two years as an outsider, counting down until college.

But then Ethan Price had walked back into her life, and suddenly everything was complicated and confusing and terrifying and wonderful all at once.

He had a girlfriend. He had a future mapped out. He had a life that didn't have space for someone like her—someone who would question his choices and see through his performance and remind him of who he used to be.

But he'd invited her to his game. He'd walked her to the parking lot. He'd told her she mattered.

And now Sophia had to figure out what to do with that information.

She thought about nine-year-old Ethan teaching her crossovers, making her laugh, understanding her in ways no one else did. She thought about seventeen-year-old Ethan on the ice tonight, completely in his element.

She thought about the moment in the parking lot when he'd looked at her and said *I don't know if there's any 'just me' left* and she'd seen straight through to the boy she remembered.

Nothing about this was balanced. Everything was tilting, accelerating, heading toward something she couldn't predict but could feel approaching.

Sophia pulled her blanket tighter and admitted the truth to herself, there in the dark where no one could hear:

She was falling for Ethan Price.

Maybe she'd never stopped.

And he was with someone else, and this was going to hurt.

---

## Saturday, September 10th - 11:47 AM

Sophia woke late on Saturday, disoriented and still tired. She'd stayed up too late replaying every moment of the game, every word in the parking lot.

Her phone showed three texts.

**Ethan (10:23 AM): Good morning! Still sleeping off the game probably.**

**Ethan (10:45 AM): Random question - you free tomorrow? Want to take you skating. Like old times.**

**Ethan (11:15 AM): Okay definitely still asleep. Text me when you're alive.**

Sophia stared at the messages, heart racing. He wanted to take her skating. Tomorrow. Just the two of them.

This was dangerous territory. But she was already typing.

**Sophia: Sorry, just woke up. Skating sounds good. What time?**

The response came immediately.

**Ethan: 11 AM? I know this outdoor rink near Assiniboine Park. Where I used to go before everything got serious.**

**Sophia: Okay. Should I meet you there?**

**Ethan: I'll pick you up. 10:45. Dress warm.**

**Sophia: See you then.**

She put her phone down and tried not to think about what this meant. Tried not to think about the fact that he was choosing to spend his Sunday with her instead of with Becca or his team or doing whatever hockey captains did on weekends.

Her phone buzzed again. Maya this time.

**Maya: Badminton girls are going to a movie tonight. Want to come? 7pm showing.**

A month ago, Sophia would have said yes immediately. Would have been grateful for the invitation, for potential friends, for something to do that didn't involve sitting alone in her room.

But now all she could think about was tomorrow. Skating with Ethan.

**Sophia: Can't tonight. Family stuff. But thanks for the invite!**

**Maya: No worries. Next time!**

Sophia felt a twinge of guilt. She was lying to Maya. She was prioritizing a boy over potential friends. She was making all the classic mistakes.

But she couldn't bring herself to care.

Tomorrow she'd skate with Ethan. She'd recapture something from childhood, just for a few hours.

And maybe that would be enough.

---

## Sunday, September 11th - Morning

Ethan's truck pulled up at 10:45 exactly.

Sophia climbed in, and he grinned at her. "Ready?"

"I'm going to fall constantly and embarrass myself."

"Probably. But that's half the fun."

He drove them to a small outdoor rink near Assiniboine Park—nothing fancy, just a community rink with wooden boards and a warming house. It was almost empty, just a few families with young kids wobbling around.

"This is where I used to come when I first moved here," Ethan said, pulling skates out of his truck. "Before AAA and elite training and all that. When it was still just... fun."

"Why'd you stop?"

"Got too serious too fast, I guess." He handed her a pair of women's skates. "These were my mom's. Should fit."

Sophia laced up the skates, and muscle memory kicked in. Her body remembered this—the slight forward lean, the way her weight distributed, the anticipation of ice.

They stepped onto the rink, and Sophia immediately wobbled.

Ethan caught her elbow, laughing. "Easy. Give it a second."

"I told you I'd be terrible."

"You're not terrible. You're just out of practice."

He skated backward in front of her, holding both her hands, pulling her slowly across the ice. Just like he'd done when they were nine.

"There you go," he said. "Feel it coming back?"

"Maybe."

They made slow circuits around the rink. Sophia fell twice—once on her own, once because a toddler cut in front of her—and both times Ethan helped her up, patient and encouraging.

After about twenty minutes, her body really did remember. Her ankles remembered how to hold steady. Her legs remembered how to push and glide.

"Okay," Ethan said. "Now try a crossover."

"Absolutely not."

"Come on. For old times' sake."

"I'll die."

"You won't die. Front foot pushes under, back foot comes around and over. Remember? Double helix."

Sophia took a breath and tried. She made it three steps before losing the pattern.

"Better!" Ethan circled around her. "Again."

She tried again. And again. And on the fourth try, she made it halfway around the rink.

"YES!" Ethan was grinning like she'd just won Olympic gold. "You did it!"

"I did it," she echoed, surprised and delighted.

"Now race me."

"I'll lose."

"Obviously. But race me anyway."

They raced to the blue line, and Sophia did lose, but it didn't matter. What mattered was the cold air and the scrape of blades and the sound of Ethan's laugh when she tried to trip him at the finish line.

What mattered was that for this one morning, they were nine years old again, and nothing was complicated yet.

They skated until Sophia's legs ached and her face hurt from smiling. In the warming house afterward, drinking hot chocolate from a vending machine, she felt more herself than she had since the move.

"Thank you," she said. "For this."

"Thank you for coming." Ethan wrapped his hands around his cup. "I needed this. Just... being normal for a minute."

"This is normal for you?"

"This is who I wish I could be more often. Just some guy skating on a Sunday morning. Not the star player, not the NHL prospect. Just... Ethan."

"I like just Ethan."

He looked at her, and something passed between them. Something warm and dangerous and inevitable.

"I should probably get you home," he said finally, but he didn't move.

"Yeah. Probably."

They sat there for another few minutes, neither of them ready to leave this bubble where they could just be themselves.

Finally, reluctantly, they gathered their things and headed to the truck. The drive back was quiet, comfortable, neither of them needing to fill the silence.

Ethan pulled up in front of her house at 1:15.

"So," he said. "Same time next week?"

Sophia's heart jumped. "Next week?"

"If you want. I mean, this was fun. We could make it a thing. Sunday skating."

"What about Becca?"

The question came out before she could stop it, and Ethan's expression shifted. Became more guarded.

"Becca's... she's not really into skating. And she has debate prep on Sunday mornings." He looked at Sophia. "Is that weird? Us hanging out without her?"

Yes. It was weird. It was crossing lines. It was setting up a pattern that couldn't end well.

"No," Sophia heard herself say. "It's not weird. We're friends."

"Yeah. Friends." But the way he said it felt loaded with meaning.

"I should go," Sophia said, reaching for the door handle.

"Soph?"

"Yeah?"

"This was the best morning I've had in a really long time."

She didn't know what to say to that, so she just smiled and climbed out of the truck.

Inside, she went straight to her room, closed the door, and let herself feel everything she'd been holding back all morning.

She was in love with Ethan Price.

Not the crush she'd had at nine. Real, complicated, devastating love.

And he had a girlfriend.

In a few hours, he'd go back to his regular life, and Sophia would just be the girl he used to know.

Her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Made it home. Already miss the ice.**

**Sophia: Same.**

**Ethan: See you tomorrow in calc?**

**Sophia: See you tomorrow.**

She put her phone down and stared at the ceiling, trying to organize her thoughts.

For now, she had this: Ethan Price skating beside her, calling her Soph, reminding her what it felt like to be known.

And she was going to hold onto that for as long as she possibly could.

Even if it hurt later.

Even if this all fell apart.

For now, it was enough.

---

## Sunday Evening - 9:47 PM

Sophia was doing physics homework, trying not to think about tomorrow's calculus class, when her phone lit up with a notification.

Instagram. Maya had tagged her in a story.

Curious, she opened it.

It was a photo from the movie last night—Maya, Sarah, Claire, and a few other badminton girls crowded into a booth at the theater, smiling. Caption: "Missing @sophiachen but she'll be there next time!"

Sophia smiled and was about to close the app when she noticed she had a DM request.

From @beccamartinez.

Her stomach dropped.

She opened it.

**Becca: Hey! Hope it's ok I'm reaching out. Just wanted to say it's really cool that you and Ethan reconnected. He's been so much happier this week. Anyway, we're having a study group Tuesday after school for calc - you should come! Would be good to get to know you better. :)**

Sophia stared at the message for a long moment.

It was nice. Friendly. Exactly what the perfect girlfriend would send.

But underneath it, Sophia could read the subtext: *I know something's happening. I'm watching.*

She was typing a response when another notification popped up.

Instagram story from @ethanprice23.

Against her better judgment, she clicked it.

It was a photo from this morning. The outdoor rink. Sophia in the foreground, slightly blurry, mid-laugh, hands out for balance. Caption: "Teaching old tricks to old friends. Best Sunday."

He'd posted a photo of them. Of *her*. On his public Instagram with 2,000 followers.

She clicked through to see who'd viewed it.

847 views already.

And then she saw the comments.

**@tyler_hayes23: Who's the mystery girl Price?**

**@beccamartinez: So this is where you were this morning! Looks fun :)**

**@marcus_hockey: wait who is that**

**@jess_thompson: omg is that the new girl from ontario???**

**@random_username: price has a gf tho???**

This was bad.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Maya.

**Maya: Ummmm so you were with Ethan Price today?? Instagram is TALKING. You ok?**

Then another buzz. Different number. Unknown.

**Unknown: This is Claire (from badminton). Just saw the Instagram. Want you to know whatever's happening, we've got your back. But also maybe be careful? People are already talking.**

Sophia's phone kept buzzing. More Instagram notifications. More views. More comments.

And then the one that made her blood run cold.

Comment from @beccamartinez, posted three minutes ago:

**@beccamartinez: @ethanprice23 We need to talk.**

Sophia's phone rang.

Ethan.

She answered.

"Soph, I'm so sorry. I didn't think— I just posted a photo and now Becca's upset and people are commenting and I—"

In the background, she could hear raised voices. His parents, maybe. Or Becca. Or both.

"I have to go," Ethan said quickly. "But we'll figure this out, okay? I'll fix this."

"Ethan—"

"I have to go. I'm sorry."

He hung up.

Sophia sat on her bed watching the Instagram comments pile up.

Her phone buzzed again. Screenshot from an unknown number.

It was a group chat she wasn't in. St. Paul's students.

**Hockey gossip?? Price posting mystery girl while Becca's at debate prep?**

**That's the new transfer. Sophia something.**

**Wait doesn't Becca have debate WITH HER on Tuesday? Awkward...**

**plot twist: old friend or new drama???**

**beccas gonna lose it**

**price is an idiot lmao**

She opened Instagram again. Ethan's story was still up. Still getting views. Still getting comments.

She should text him. Tell him to take it down. Tell him they needed to stop this before it got worse.

But even as she thought it, she knew it was too late.

The damage was done.

Tomorrow she'd walk into St. Paul's, and everyone would be talking about her. About them. About the photo.

Tomorrow Becca would look at her differently.

Tomorrow everything would change.

She looked at her phone one more time. The photo was still there. Sophia mid-laugh, Ethan's caption: "Best Sunday."

For a few hours this morning, she'd forgotten about complications.

But now reality was crashing back.

Her phone buzzed one more time.

Text from Ethan.

**Ethan: Took down the story. But I think a lot of people already saw it. I'm sorry. This is my fault. See you tomorrow?**

Tomorrow. Calculus. Sitting three rows behind him, knowing everyone in that classroom had seen the photo. Knowing Becca had seen it.

Knowing that whatever this thing between them was, it couldn't stay hidden anymore.

She typed back: **See you tomorrow.**

Then she turned off her phone, lay in the dark, and tried not to think about what came next.

Just acceleration toward something she couldn't control.

She'd known this would hurt.

She just hadn't expected it to happen so soon.
