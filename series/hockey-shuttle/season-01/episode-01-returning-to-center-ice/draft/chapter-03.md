# Chapter 3: Reconnection

## Wednesday, September 7th

Sophia was at her locker before homeroom when her phone buzzed.

**Ethan: Coffee this afternoon? I'm done at 3:30. Can show you around the city.**

She stared at the message, weighing options. The smart thing would be to say no. To maintain distance, protect herself, avoid complications. But standing there in the hallway with students streaming past, she felt the loneliness of the last three days like a physical weight.

Besides, they were friends once. They could be friends again. Just friends.

**Sophia: Okay. Where?**

**Ethan: I'll pick you up out front. Bring questions - Winnipeg is full of weird facts.**

Three hours later, Sophia stood outside the main entrance watching for whatever Ethan drove. She was expecting... actually, she didn't know what she was expecting. Something flashy, maybe. Something that screamed "hockey star."

Instead, a slightly beat-up silver pickup truck pulled up, and Ethan leaned out the window grinning.

"Your chariot awaits."

Sophia climbed in, trying not to notice how the truck smelled like him—some combination of laundry detergent and that specific Ethan-smell she remembered from childhood. The cab was cluttered but not dirty: water bottles, a hoodie, a textbook wedged under the passenger seat.

"Nice truck," she said.

"Thanks. It's ancient but reliable. My dad gave it to me when I got my license." He pulled out of the parking lot. "Figured we'd go to The Forks—it's kind of the heart of the city. Good place to start."

"What's The Forks?"

"You'll see."

He drove with one hand on the wheel, relaxed, pointing out landmarks as they went. "That's Canadian Tire Centre—where I used to play before I made varsity. That coffee shop is the only one open past nine that isn't a chain. That's Tyler's house—we've been teammates since I moved here."

Sophia watched the city scroll past, trying to imagine Ethan at nine years old, new and scared, navigating this place alone.

"Was it hard?" she asked suddenly. "Moving here?"

Ethan glanced at her. "Yeah. Really hard, actually."

"But you had hockey."

"I had hockey." He said it like that explained everything and nothing. "My parents had this whole vision, you know? AAA team, elite coaching, pathway to NHL. And I wanted that too, I guess. But I was nine. Mostly I just missed Millbrook."

"Did you make friends?"

"Eventually. Tyler's family kind of adopted me that first year. His mom was our team manager and she'd noticed I was eating alone at the rink, so she started inviting me for dinner." He turned onto Waterfront Drive. "She makes this amazing borscht. Changed my life."

"Through soup."

"Through soup," he agreed, smiling. "What about you? After I left?"

Sophia looked out the window. "I quit skating."

"I know. You said. But why really?"

"It wasn't the same."

The admission hung in the air between them. Ethan was quiet for a moment, then: "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"That my leaving messed things up for you. I didn't—I mean, I knew I'd miss you, but I didn't think about how you'd feel."

"We were nine. Nobody thinks about other people's feelings at nine."

"You did. You always did." He pulled into a parking lot. "Okay, we're here."

The Forks was beautiful in that early September way—still green but with hints of gold creeping into the leaves. The historic buildings had been converted into shops and restaurants, and the river sparkled in the afternoon sun. It was busy but not crowded, full of people walking dogs and riding bikes and just existing.

"Come on." Ethan led her down a path toward the river. "There's this spot I want to show you."

They walked in silence for a bit, and Sophia realized this was the first time since moving that she'd felt almost relaxed. Maybe it was being away from school. Maybe it was the sound of the river. Maybe it was just being with someone who knew her before she became "the new girl."

"Here." Ethan stopped at a bench overlooking the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. "This is where I come when I need to think."

"About hockey?"

"About everything." He sat down, and Sophia joined him. "Hockey, school, what happens after graduation. Whether I'm actually good enough or if everyone's just being nice."

Sophia turned to look at him. "You're definitely good enough. Tyler said scouts are already watching."

"Tyler exaggerates."

"Does he?"

Ethan shrugged, but she could see the tension in his shoulders. "There's good, and then there's NHL-good. The gap is bigger than people think."

"But you're working toward it."

"Every day. Summer training, season training, off-ice conditioning, film study. My entire life is basically designed around hockey." He said it matter-of-factly, not complaining, just stating reality. "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to just... not."

"Not what?"

"Not have every decision I make filtered through 'is this good for hockey.' Not have my parents' entire financial future riding on whether I make it. Not have everyone at school know me as 'Ethan Price, hockey player' before they know anything else about me."

Sophia studied him. This was different from the confident guy she'd seen in the hallways, different from the easy charm he'd shown at lunch. This was real.

"What would you do?" she asked. "If you could be anyone?"

Ethan laughed softly. "Honestly? I'd probably study engineering. Go to MIT or Caltech, do research, solve problems that matter. But that's not—that's not the plan."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm good at hockey. Really good. And walking away from that would be stupid when so many people would kill for this chance."

"But if it's not what you want—"

"It's not that simple, Soph." He turned to face her. "Do you know how much my parents have invested in this? Not just money—though that too—but time, energy, their whole lives. My dad turned down promotions because the travel would interfere with my schedule. My mom learned everything about sports nutrition so she could optimize my diet. They've sacrificed everything."

"For your dream or theirs?"

The question came out sharper than she intended, but Ethan didn't look offended. Just tired.

"I don't know anymore," he admitted. "Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe they're the same thing now."

A duck paddled past in the river below, oblivious to teenage existential crises. Sophia watched it for a moment, thinking.

"You know what I remember most about when we were kids?" she said finally.

"What?"

"How you'd explain things. Like crossovers—you made me think about DNA. Or math problems—you'd turn them into stories. You were teaching me physics before either of us knew what physics was."

"You're saying I should be a teacher?"

"I'm saying you've always been someone who sees patterns and connections. That's not just hockey. That's how your brain works."

Ethan was quiet, processing. Then: "You're still doing that too."

"Doing what?"

"Seeing people clearly. Understanding things about them they haven't said out loud." He smiled at her, and it was the first completely unguarded expression she'd seen since the reunion. "I forgot how much I missed talking to you."

Sophia's heart did something complicated in her chest. "We only talked for two days."

"Still."

The moment stretched between them, comfortable but charged with something she couldn't name. Then Ethan's phone buzzed, and he checked it with a grimace.

"Becca. Asking where I am."

Right. Becca. The girlfriend. The person who actually belonged in his present.

"You should probably tell her," Sophia said, standing up.

"I did. Earlier." But he typed out a response anyway. "Sorry. She gets anxious when I'm not where she expects me to be."

"That's... nice?" Sophia didn't know what to say. "That she cares."

"Yeah." Ethan pocketed his phone. "She's great. Really great. We've been together since sophomore year. She's—you'd like her, I think. If you got to know her."

Sophia made a noncommittal sound. She'd met Becca twice and both times had felt like an intruder. But that wasn't Becca's fault. That was Sophia's own issue to deal with.

"Come on," Ethan said. "Let me show you the market before we head back."

They spent the next hour wandering through The Forks Market—a maze of local vendors selling everything from handmade jewelry to fresh produce to Indigenous art. Ethan bought them both coffee from a tiny stand run by a woman who clearly knew him.

"Ethan Price!" she exclaimed. "Where have you been all summer?"

"Training camp, Mrs. Reyes. You know how it is."

"Working too hard, as always." She turned to Sophia. "Is this your girlfriend? About time you brought someone nice around!"

"This is Sophia," Ethan said quickly. "Old friend from Millbrook. Just moved here."

"Well, welcome to Winnipeg, Sophia! Any friend of Ethan's gets the good coffee." She poured them two cups from a special carafe. "On the house."

Outside, Sophia raised an eyebrow. "The good coffee?"

"She's convinced the regular stuff isn't strong enough for athletes. This is her special blend." He took a sip. "Honestly? I can't tell the difference, but it makes her happy."

They sat on a bench overlooking the river, drinking the allegedly superior coffee, and Sophia felt something shift. This was familiar—just sitting, talking, existing together. Like no time had passed at all.

"So," Ethan said. "Tell me about badminton."

"What about it?"

"Why badminton? You could have stuck with hockey. Or done nothing."

Sophia considered the question. "My mom suggested it. Said I needed something athletic that wasn't skating. I went to one practice and..." She shrugged. "I liked it. The speed, the strategy. It's like chess but with your whole body."

"Are you good?"

"I'm competitive provincially. Not nationals-level, but solid."

"Sophia Chen: too modest, as always." Ethan grinned. "I bet you're amazing."

"I bet you're biased."

"Maybe. But I remember you—once you decided to learn something, you didn't stop until you mastered it."

"That was math competitions."

"That was everything. You had this intensity. Still do, probably."

Sophia felt her face heat. "I'm just... persistent."

"It's more than that. You're brilliant. Always were." He said it so casually, like it was obvious fact. "You're definitely going to do something important. Engineering, physics, whatever. You'll probably win a Nobel Prize or something."

"That's ridiculous."

"Is it? You came in third at regionals in fourth grade. Against fifth and sixth graders." He bumped her shoulder with his. "I came in first, but only because you made me work for it."

"You remember that?"

"Of course I remember. We studied together for two weeks. You made flashcards."

"You made up songs about prime numbers."

"They worked!"

They were both laughing now, and it felt like being nine again, like the eight years had compressed into nothing.

Sophia's phone buzzed. Text from her mom: **Home for dinner?**

She checked the time—5:47. They'd been here for over two hours.

"I should go," she said reluctantly. "My parents get weird about dinner."

"Yeah, I need to get home too. Practice in the morning." Ethan stood and stretched. "But this was good. Really good."

"It was."

They walked back to the truck, and Sophia tried to memorize the feeling of this afternoon—the ease of it, the way conversation flowed, the sense that maybe she wasn't completely alone here after all.

Ethan drove her home, pointing out more landmarks, and pulled up in front of her house exactly at 6:00.

"So," he said. "Friday. Hockey game. You coming?"

Sophia had been avoiding thinking about this decision, but sitting here in the truck with him, the answer felt obvious.

"Yeah. I'll come."

His whole face lit up. "Seriously?"

"If you're offering a ticket."

"I'm offering a ticket. I'll text you details." He hesitated, then: "Thanks for today, Soph. For listening and not thinking I'm crazy for having doubts about stuff."

"You're not crazy. You're just thinking about your life."

"Becca doesn't really get it. She thinks I'm lucky, having such a clear path."

Sophia didn't know what to say to that. So instead she said, "See you tomorrow in calc?"

"See you tomorrow."

She climbed out of the truck and watched him drive away, then stood in her driveway for a moment, thinking.

This was dangerous. Getting close to Ethan again, spending time with him, learning about his doubts and dreams—it was dangerous because she could feel herself starting to care. Not just about their old friendship, but about him now. The person he'd become.

And he had a girlfriend. A serious girlfriend. A perfect girlfriend who probably never made him question his choices because she fit seamlessly into his world.

Sophia went inside, survived dinner (her parents asking too many questions about her day), and retreated to her room. She pulled out her laptop, intending to do homework, but instead found herself googling "Bell MTS Iceplex."

The arena looked intimidating. Professional. The kind of place where serious hockey happened.

She was going to watch Ethan play on Friday. She was going to see him in his element, doing the thing that defined his entire life.

And she had no idea how that was going to make her feel.

## Thursday, September 8th - Badminton Practice

Sophia almost skipped badminton practice.

She'd gotten the email from Coach Peterson about first practice being Thursday at 3:30, and she'd spent all day talking herself out of it. She was already behind—everyone else would know each other, know the drills, be comfortable. She'd be the outsider again.

But at 3:25, she found herself standing outside the gym with her racket bag, trying to decide between facing new people or hiding in her room.

"You must be Sophia!"

A girl appeared—tall, athletic, with box braids pulled back in a high ponytail and an expression of genuine welcome. She stuck out her hand.

"Maya Foster. Team captain. Coach told me we had a new player from Ontario."

"Yeah. Hi." Sophia shook her hand.

"Come on, I'll introduce you to everyone. Fair warning—we're intense but friendly. And we're always looking for strong players." Maya held the gym door open. "What level were you playing at in Ontario?"

"Competitive provincial. Made it to semifinals last year."

"Nice! We compete provincially too, and we're hoping to make nationals this year. Do you play singles or doubles?"

"Singles mostly, but I can do doubles."

"Perfect. We need depth in both."

The gym was set up with four badminton courts, nets already in place. About fifteen girls were warming up, hitting birdies back and forth, stretching. They all looked competent and comfortable, and Sophia felt her anxiety spike.

"Okay everyone!" Maya clapped her hands. "Quick intro—this is Sophia Chen, transfer from Ontario. She's playing competitive provincial, so she knows her stuff. Make her feel welcome."

There was a chorus of "hi" and "welcome" and then everyone went back to warming up, and somehow that was perfect. No pressure, no performance, just acceptance.

"You can join Sarah and Claire for warm-ups," Maya said, pointing to two girls hitting on the far court. "Then we'll do some drills and maybe run a round-robin if we have time."

Sophia dropped her bag and grabbed her racket, trying to shake off the nerves. This was her thing. She knew how to do this.

Sarah and Claire turned out to be a doubles team—seniors who'd been playing together since freshman year. They were good, sending the birdie back and forth in a rhythm that spoke to years of partnership.

"Want to join?" Sarah called.

Sophia stepped onto the court, and the moment she hit her first shot—a clean overhead clear that sailed to the back line—she felt something settle. This was familiar. This was hers.

They warmed up for twenty minutes, then Coach Peterson—a compact woman in her forties with intense eyes—called them together.

"All right, ladies. Welcome back, welcome to our new players. This year we're aiming high—nationals, if we work for it. That means commitment, discipline, and pushing each other to improve." She ran through the season schedule, tournament dates, practice expectations. Then: "Let's see what we're working with. Round-robin singles, first to eleven points. Maya, you're up first with Sophia."

Sophia felt everyone's eyes on her. The new girl, being tested immediately.

Maya grinned. "Don't hold back. I won't."

They took positions on opposite sides of the court, and Sophia served.

The rally that followed was fast and brutal. Maya was good—really good—with powerful smashes and quick reflexes. But Sophia had spent two years training against some of the best players in Ontario, and she knew how to read opponents.

Maya's smash was predictable—always crosscourt when she was in the right corner. Sophia started anticipating, returning with drops that forced Maya to the net. The rallies got longer, more intense.

At 10-9, Sophia's favor, Maya sent up a high clear. Sophia jumped, twisted, and smashed—perfect angle, perfect speed. The birdie hit just inside the line.

"Point. Game to Sophia, 11-9."

They met at the net, both breathing hard.

"Okay, you're actually really good," Maya said, grinning. "Coach wasn't kidding."

"You too. That backhand was scary."

"Wait until you see my serve." Maya glanced at Coach Peterson, who was taking notes. "I think you just made varsity."

The rest of practice flew by. Sophia played three more matches—won two, lost one—and by the end she was exhausted and energized. This was what she'd needed. A space that was just hers, where she was valued for her skill, not for who she used to know.

In the locker room afterward, Maya appeared next to her.

"Hey, some of us are going for smoothies at Tall Grass Prairie. Want to come?"

Sophia's instinct was to say no. To protect herself from potential rejection or awkwardness. But Maya was looking at her with genuine friendliness, and saying no felt like closing a door she might need.

"Sure. Yeah, okay."

Twenty minutes later, she was squished into a booth at a trendy juice place with Maya, Sarah, and Claire, drinking something purple and probably extremely healthy.

"So," Claire said. "What brought you to Winnipeg?"

Sophia gave the abbreviated version—parents' jobs, last-minute move, starting junior year at new school.

"That's rough," Sarah said sympathetically. "Junior year too. Everyone's so established already."

"Yeah, I noticed."

"How are you finding St. Paul's?" Maya asked.

"It's... big. Overwhelming."

"Do you know anyone?"

Sophia hesitated. "Actually, yeah. Ethan Price—we were friends when we were kids, before he moved here."

All three girls exchanged glances.

"Ethan Price," Claire said slowly. "The hockey player."

"Yeah."

"You're friends with Ethan Price."

"We were friends. When we were nine. I don't know what we are now."

Maya leaned forward, interested. "But you've talked to him since you moved?"

"A few times. He's been... nice. Showing me around."

"That's good," Sarah said, but she sounded cautious. "Ethan's a good guy. Really popular, obviously. But genuine, you know? Not an asshole like some of the hockey players."

"He's also very taken," Claire added. "He and Becca Martinez have been together forever. Like, relationship goals forever."

"I know. I met her."

"Right, of course." Maya took a long drink of her smoothie. "Sorry, we're not trying to be weird. It's just—the hockey players kind of exist in their own universe at St. Paul's. They're not unfriendly, exactly. Just... separate."

Sophia absorbed this information. "So me being friends with Ethan is weird?"

"Not weird. Just... unexpected." Sarah seemed to be choosing her words carefully. "The hockey team and everyone else don't really mix. Different social circles."

"But you're on the badminton team," Claire added quickly. "So you're automatically one of us. And we're way cooler than hockey."

"Objectively cooler," Maya agreed. "We have better endurance, faster reflexes, and we don't smell like equipment bags."

They all laughed, and Sophia felt some of her anxiety ease. These were good people. Potential real friends.

"So you're going to make varsity for sure," Maya said, steering the conversation back to badminton. "Which means you'll travel to tournaments with us. First one is in three weeks—Grand Forks."

"North Dakota?"

"Yep. It's actually fun—we make a weekend of it. You should come."

"I'll think about it."

"Think hard. We need you." Maya grinned. "Plus, it's good to have friends outside the school bubble, you know? People who know you for you, not for who you sit with at lunch."

Sophia understood what she was really saying: You can have your hockey-player friend, but you should have other friends too. Friends in your own world.

"Thanks," she said. "For being welcoming. I was nervous about today."

"Please. You destroyed me in that match. You have nothing to be nervous about."

They stayed at the smoothie place for another hour, talking about badminton and teachers and the weird dynamics of St. Paul's social hierarchy. By the time Sophia got home at 6:45, she felt lighter than she had since the move.

Her phone buzzed while she was doing homework.

**Ethan: How was badminton?**

**Sophia: Good. Made varsity, probably.**

**Ethan: Of course you did. Told you you were amazing.**

**Sophia: How was hockey practice?**

**Ethan: Brutal. Coach is in playoff mode already. But good. Excited for tomorrow.**

**Sophia: Nervous?**

**Ethan: Always. But that's part of it.**

Sophia stared at her phone, thinking about what Maya and Sarah and Claire had said. About hockey players existing in their own universe. About Ethan and Becca being relationship goals.

**Sophia: You'll be great. You're always great.**

**Ethan: Come early tomorrow if you can. I want you to meet the team properly. 6:30?**

That was probably a bad idea. That was definitely crossing some kind of line from "old friends reconnecting" into "actively part of his life."

**Sophia: Okay. I'll be there.**

**Ethan: :) See you then, Soph.**

She put her phone down and tried to focus on her physics homework—kinetic energy, momentum, conservation principles. But all she could think about was tomorrow. Watching Ethan play. Being part of his world, even just for one night.

Maya's words echoed: *People who know you for you, not for who you sit with at lunch.*

Sophia had spent three days trying to figure out who she was in this new place. But sitting here alone in her room, she realized the truth: she didn't know yet. She was still becoming.

And maybe that was okay.

Maybe you didn't have to have all the answers right away. Maybe you could just show up, try things, see what felt right.

Tomorrow she'd watch Ethan play hockey. She'd see him in his element, doing the thing that defined his entire existence.

And maybe then she'd understand what it meant that he'd come back into her life.

Or maybe she'd just get her heart broken again.

Either way, she was going to find out.

Forces in equilibrium, she thought. Net force equals zero.

But that was impossible now. Everything was in motion, accelerating in directions she couldn't predict.

All she could do was hold on and see where it took her.
