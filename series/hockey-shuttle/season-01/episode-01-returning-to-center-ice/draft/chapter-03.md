# Chapter 3: Reconnection

## Tuesday, September 6th

Sophia woke up to the smell of *congee*.

Her mother only made congee on special occasions—first days of school, exam mornings, days when she sensed Sophia needed comfort. The smell of ginger and green onion drifted up from the kitchen, mixing with the September air coming through her window.

For a moment, lying in bed in this unfamiliar room, Sophia could pretend she was back in Brampton. That yesterday hadn't happened. That Ethan Price was still a memory from childhood, not a real person she'd have to see in calculus in forty-five minutes.

Her phone buzzed. **Ethan: Morning. See you in calc?**

So much for pretending.

**Sophia: Yeah. See you.**

She got up, showered, and dressed in jeans and a gray sweater. Downstairs, her mother was ladling congee into bowls—rice porridge cooked until it was creamy and soft, topped with shredded chicken, century egg, and cilantro.

"Sit," her mother said. "Eat."

Sophia sat. The congee was perfect—ginger warming her throat, the rice familiar and soothing. Her mother had added extra *you tiao*, the fried dough sticks that soaked up the porridge.

"How was yesterday?" her mother asked in Mandarin. She always switched to Mandarin at home.

"Fine," Sophia answered in English.

Her mother frowned but didn't push. "Your father said you seemed... anxious."

"First days are always anxious."

"Did you see Ethan?"

Of course her mother remembered Ethan. Dr. Lisa Chen forgot nothing, especially not the boy who'd made her daughter cry for weeks when he moved away.

"Yeah. We have calculus together."

"And?"

"And nothing. It's been eight years. We're different people now."

Her mother studied her over the rim of her tea cup—jasmine, always jasmine in the mornings. "Maybe. Or maybe you're the same people with more years between you."

Sophia didn't want to think about that. She finished her congee, grabbed her bag, and escaped before her mother could ask more questions.

---

The walk to school felt different today. Yesterday it had been neutral territory. Today it was the place where Ethan Price existed, and she'd have to figure out how to navigate that.

Calculus was first period. Sophia slid into the same seat as yesterday—back row, good view of the board, easy escape route to the door. The classroom filled up, and then Ethan appeared, on time today, heading straight for his seat three rows ahead.

But he paused at her desk. "Hey."

"Hey."

"So I was thinking," he said, lowering his voice so the students around them couldn't hear. "That coffee thing I mentioned. You free after school tomorrow? Wednesday?"

Sophia's brain immediately supplied reasons to say no. But her mouth said: "Yeah. I'm free."

"Cool. I can pick you up out front. Show you around the city, get coffee, whatever."

"Okay."

He smiled—that unguarded smile from childhood—and headed to his seat. Sophia spent the entire period trying to focus on derivatives while her mind kept wandering to tomorrow. Coffee with Ethan. Alone. Without Becca or Tyler or anyone else.

Just the two of them.

This was either the best or worst idea ever.

## Wednesday, September 7th - After School

Sophia was at her locker after the last bell, debating whether to text Ethan and cancel, when he appeared.

"Ready?"

Her heart jumped. "Yeah. I guess."

"You guess?"

"I'm ready. Definitely ready."

He grinned. "Come on."

His truck was in the student parking lot—the same beat-up silver pickup from Monday. Sophia climbed in, and the smell hit her immediately: laundry detergent, something vaguely minty (gum? deodorant?), and underneath it all, that specific Ethan-smell she remembered from childhood.

The cab was cluttered but organized. Water bottles in the cup holders, a physics textbook wedged under her seat, a hoodie balled up in the back. Evidence of a life being lived.

"Sorry about the mess," Ethan said, starting the engine. "Between hockey and school, I basically live in this truck."

"It's fine."

He pulled out of the parking lot, one hand on the wheel, completely relaxed. "So I was thinking we'd go to The Forks. It's kind of the heart of the city. Good place to start."

"What's The Forks?"

"You'll see."

As they drove, Ethan pointed out landmarks. "That's the Canadian Tire Centre—where I used to play before varsity. Tyler's house is over there—his family basically adopted me when I moved here."

Sophia watched the city scroll past. Winnipeg in early September was beautiful—trees still green but with hints of gold, the air carrying that first edge of autumn. The light had a quality she wasn't used to from Brampton, somehow bigger and more open.

"Was it hard?" she asked suddenly. "Moving here?"

Ethan glanced at her. "Yeah. Really hard, actually."

"But you had hockey."

"I had hockey." He said it like that explained everything and nothing. "My parents had this whole vision, you know? AAA team, elite coaching, pathway to NHL. And I wanted that too, I guess. But I was nine. Mostly I just missed Millbrook. Missed... everything."

The pause before "everything" felt deliberate, like he'd been about to say something more specific but changed his mind.

"Did you make friends?" Sophia asked.

"Eventually. Tyler's family kind of adopted me that first year. His mom, Mrs. Hayes—she noticed I was eating lunch alone at the rink after practice. Just sitting there doing homework in the stands because my parents were both working and couldn't pick me up until six. So she started inviting me for dinner."

"That's nice of her."

"She saved me, honestly. Taught me that Winnipeg could be home if I let it." He turned onto Waterfront Drive. "She makes this amazing borscht. Life-changing borscht. I know that sounds stupid, but—"

"It doesn't sound stupid."

"I'd never had borscht before. Never had Ukrainian food. Never had someone outside my family just... decide I mattered." He shook his head. "Sorry. That got heavy."

"It's okay." Sophia studied his profile—the line of his jaw, the way his hands rested easy on the wheel. "What about you?" he asked. "After I left?"

Sophia looked out the window. "I quit skating."

"I know. You said. But why really?"

"It wasn't the same."

The admission hung between them. Ethan was quiet for a long moment, and when he spoke, his voice was softer. "I'm sorry. That I left, that it messed things up for you. I didn't think—I mean, I knew I'd miss you, but I was nine. I didn't really understand that you'd miss me too."

"We were nine. Nobody thinks about other people's feelings at nine."

"You did. You always did." He pulled into a parking lot overlooking a wide expanse of green space and water. "Okay, we're here."

The Forks was beautiful. Historic buildings converted to markets, pathways winding along the riverbank, the smell of grass and water. It was busy but not crowded—people walking dogs, riding bikes, just existing in the September sunshine.

"Come on." Ethan led her down a path toward the river. "There's this spot I want to show you."

They walked in comfortable silence. Sophia noticed everything: the crunch of gravel under their feet, the sound of the river moving. A dog barked in the distance. Someone was playing guitar near one of the buildings, the music carrying on the wind.

"Here." Ethan stopped at a bench overlooking the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. "This is where I come when I need to think."

They sat. The bench was sun-warm, the metal slightly rough under Sophia's hands. The rivers met in a swirl of current, two different colors mixing but maintaining their distinct characters for a long stretch before finally blending.

"About hockey?" Sophia asked.

"About everything." Ethan leaned back, arms spread along the top of the bench. "Hockey. School. What happens after graduation. Whether I'm actually good enough or if everyone's just being nice."

Sophia turned to look at him. "You're definitely good enough. Tyler said scouts are already watching."

"Tyler exaggerates."

"Does he?"

Ethan shrugged, but she could see the tension in his shoulders. "There's good, and then there's NHL-good. The gap is bigger than people think."

"But you're working toward it."

"Every day. Summer training, season training, off-ice conditioning, film study. My entire life is basically designed around hockey." He said it matter-of-factly, not complaining, just stating reality. "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to just... not."

"Not what?"

"Not have everything be about hockey all the time." He stopped, frustrated. "Like, my parents moved here for this. They work extra shifts so I can have the best training. If I screw this up..."

He didn't finish. This wasn't the confident guy from the hallways. This was someone tired of performing.

"What would you do?" Sophia asked. "If you could be anyone?"

Ethan laughed softly. "Honestly? I'd probably study engineering. Go to MIT or Caltech, do research, solve problems that matter. Design bridges or sustainable energy systems or something that actually helps people." He paused. "But that's not the plan."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm good at hockey. Really good. And walking away from that would be stupid when so many people would kill for this chance."

"But if it's not what you want—"

"It's not that simple." He turned to face her, and she saw how tired he looked. Not physically—he was obviously in peak condition—but something else. "My parents. They moved here. They work extra. My dad turned down promotions. Everything's been about getting me here."

"For your dream or theirs?"

The question came out sharper than she intended, but Ethan didn't look offended. Just tired.

"I don't know anymore," he admitted. "Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe they're the same thing now."

A duck paddled past in the river below, completely unconcerned with teenage existential crises. Sophia watched it for a moment, thinking.

"You know what I remember most about when we were kids?" she said finally.

"What?"

"How you'd explain things. Like crossovers—you made me think about DNA. Or math problems—you'd turn them into stories about trains and trajectories. You weren't just teaching me to skate or to solve equations. You were teaching me to see patterns, to make connections."

"You're saying I should be a teacher?"

"I'm saying you've always been someone who sees patterns and connections. That's not just hockey. That's how your brain works. Engineering is about seeing patterns and connections. So is physics. So is basically any field that involves problem-solving."

Ethan was quiet, processing. "You're still doing that too."

"Doing what?"

"Seeing people clearly. Understanding things about them they haven't said out loud." He smiled at her, and it was completely unguarded. "I forgot how much I missed talking to you."

Sophia's heart did something complicated in her chest. "We've only talked for three days."

"Still. It's different with you. Like I can just... be. Without performing."

The moment stretched between them, comfortable but charged with something Sophia didn't want to name. Then Ethan's phone buzzed, and he checked it with a slight grimace.

"Becca. Asking where I am."

Right. Becca. The girlfriend. The person who actually belonged in his present.

"You should probably tell her," Sophia said, standing up.

"I did. Earlier." But he typed out a response anyway. "Sorry. She gets anxious when I'm not where she expects me to be."

"That's..." Sophia didn't know what to say. "That she cares."

"Yeah." Ethan pocketed his phone. "She's great. Really great. We've been together since sophomore year. Everyone says we're relationship goals."

He said it like he was trying to convince himself.

"Come on," he added. "Let me show you the market before we head back."

They spent the next hour wandering through The Forks Market—a maze of local vendors selling everything from handmade jewelry to fresh produce to Indigenous art. The air inside smelled like coffee and fresh bread. Voices echoed off the high ceilings, mixing with laughter and the hiss of espresso machines.

Ethan bought them both coffee from a tiny stand run by a woman who clearly knew him.

"Ethan Price!" she exclaimed. "Where have you been all summer?"

"Training camp, Mrs. Reyes. You know how it is."

"Working too hard, as always." She turned to Sophia with warm eyes. "Is this your girlfriend? About time you brought someone nice around!"

"This is Sophia," Ethan said quickly, his face slightly flushed. "Old friend from Millbrook. Just moved here."

"Well, welcome to Winnipeg, Sophia! Any friend of Ethan's gets the good coffee." She poured them two cups from a special carafe behind the counter. "On the house."

Outside, walking through the market with their coffees, Sophia raised an eyebrow. "The good coffee?"

"She's convinced the regular stuff isn't strong enough for athletes. This is her special blend." He took a sip. "Honestly? I can't tell the difference. But it makes her happy, so..."

They found a bench overlooking the river and sat, drinking the allegedly superior coffee. The afternoon sun was warm on Sophia's face, the coffee bitter and perfect, and for the first time since moving to Winnipeg, she felt almost relaxed.

"So," Ethan said. "Tell me about badminton."

"What about it?"

"Why badminton? You could have stuck with hockey. Or done nothing."

Sophia considered the question. "My mom suggested it after I quit skating. Said I needed something athletic. I went to one practice and..." She shrugged. "I liked it. The speed, the strategy. It's like chess but with your whole body. And unlike hockey, I could do it without thinking about..."

She trailed off, but Ethan finished the thought. "Without thinking about me."

"Yeah."

"Are you good?"

"I'm competitive provincially. Made semifinals last year in Ontario. Not nationals-level, but solid."

"Sophia Chen: too modest, as always." Ethan grinned. "I bet you're amazing."

"I bet you're biased."

"Maybe. But I remember you—once you decided to learn something, you didn't stop until you mastered it. That was true for math, for skating, for everything."

"That was competitions."

"That was your whole approach to life. You had this intensity. Still do, probably."

Sophia felt her face heat. "I'm just... persistent."

"It's more than that. You're brilliant. Always were." He said it so casually, like it was obvious fact. "You're definitely going to do something important. Engineering, physics, whatever. You'll probably win a Nobel Prize."

"That's ridiculous."

"Is it? You came in third at regionals in fourth grade. Against fifth and sixth graders." He bumped her shoulder with his. "I came in first, but only because you made me work for it."

"You remember that?"

"Of course I remember. We studied together for two weeks straight. You made flashcards."

"You made up songs about prime numbers."

"They worked!"

They were both laughing now, and it felt like being nine again, like the eight years had compressed into nothing and they were just Soph and Ethan, best friends who understood each other without trying.

Sophia's phone buzzed. Text from her mom: **Home for dinner? Making dumplings.**

She checked the time—5:47. They'd been here for over two hours.

"I should go," she said reluctantly. "My mom's making dumplings. It's like... a thing. When she makes dumplings, you show up."

"Understood. My mom's the same with pierogies." Ethan stood and stretched. "But this was good. Really good."

"It was."

They walked back to the truck, and Sophia tried to memorize the feeling of this afternoon—the ease of it, the way conversation flowed, the sense that maybe she wasn't completely alone here after all.

Ethan drove her home, the truck cab warm with late-afternoon sun, neither of them needing to fill the silence. He pulled up in front of her house exactly at 6:00.

"So," he said. "Friday. Hockey game. You coming?"

Sophia had been avoiding thinking about this decision, but sitting here in the truck with him, the answer felt obvious.

"Yeah. I'll come."

His whole face lit up. "Seriously?"

"If you're offering a ticket."

"I'm offering a ticket. I'll text you details." He hesitated, then: "Thanks for today, Soph. For listening and not thinking I'm crazy for having doubts about stuff."

"You're not crazy. You're just thinking about your life."

"Becca doesn't really get it. She thinks I'm lucky, having such a clear path. Like, why would I question something so many people want?"

Sophia didn't know what to say to that. The mention of Becca created a small barrier between them, a reminder that this afternoon existed in a bubble separate from his real life.

"I should go," she said. "See you tomorrow in calc?"

"See you tomorrow."

She climbed out of the truck and watched him drive away, then stood in her driveway for a moment, thinking.

This was dangerous. Getting close to Ethan again, spending time with him, learning about his doubts and dreams—it was dangerous because she could feel herself starting to care. Not just about their old friendship, but about him now. The person he'd become.

And he had a girlfriend. A serious girlfriend. A perfect girlfriend who probably never made him question his choices because she fit seamlessly into his world.

Sophia went inside. The smell of dumplings hit her immediately—pork and chive, her favorite. Her mother was in the kitchen, rolling out dough while her father chopped vegetables.

"You're home," her mother said in Mandarin. "Good. Come help."

Sophia washed her hands and joined her mother at the counter, falling into the familiar rhythm of dumpling-making. Flour on her hands, the dough soft and elastic, the precise fold required to seal the filling inside.

"How was your afternoon?" her mother asked.

"Good. Ethan showed me around the city."

"Ethan." Her mother's hands never stopped moving, folding dumplings with practiced efficiency. "The boy who left."

"He didn't leave. His family moved."

"And now you're friends again."

"I guess."

Her mother gave her a look—the one that meant she saw more than Sophia wanted her to see. But all she said was: "Be careful, Sophia. Sometimes the past is the past for a reason."

They finished the dumplings in silence, boiled them, and ate them with black vinegar and soy sauce. Normal. Familiar. Grounding.

But even as Sophia went through the motions—dinner, homework, getting ready for bed—all she could think about was Friday. Watching Ethan play. Being part of his world, even just for one night.

This was either going to be wonderful or it was going to hurt.

Probably both.

## Thursday, September 8th - Badminton Practice

Sophia almost skipped badminton practice.

She'd gotten the email from Coach Peterson about first practice being Thursday at 3:30, and she'd spent all day talking herself out of it. She was already behind—everyone else would know each other, know the drills, be comfortable. She'd be the outsider again.

But at 3:25, she found herself standing outside the gym with her racket bag, trying to decide between facing new people or hiding in her room.

"You must be Sophia!"

A girl appeared—tall, athletic, with box braids pulled back in a high ponytail and an expression of genuine welcome. She stuck out her hand.

"Maya Foster. Team captain. Coach told me we had a new player from Ontario."

"Yeah. Hi." Sophia shook her hand. Maya's grip was firm, confident.

"Come on, I'll introduce you to everyone. Fair warning—we're intense but friendly. And we're always looking for strong players." Maya held the gym door open. "What level were you playing at in Ontario?"

"Competitive provincial. Made semifinals last year."

"Nice! We compete provincially too, and we're hoping to make nationals this year. Singles or doubles?"

"Singles mostly, but I can do doubles."

"Perfect. We need depth in both."

The gym was set up with four badminton courts, nets already in place. About fifteen girls were warming up, hitting birdies back and forth, stretching. The sound was familiar—the *thwack* of racket on birdie, squeaking shoes, the rhythmic back-and-forth of rallies.

"Okay everyone!" Maya clapped her hands. "Quick intro—this is Sophia Chen, transfer from Ontario. She's competitive provincial level, so she knows her stuff. Make her feel welcome."

There was a chorus of "hi" and "welcome" and then everyone went back to warming up, and somehow that was perfect. No pressure, no performance, just acceptance.

"You can join Sarah and Claire for warm-ups," Maya said, pointing to two girls hitting on the far court. "Then we'll do some drills and maybe run a round-robin if we have time."

Sophia dropped her bag and grabbed her racket. The grip felt good in her hand—familiar, comfortable. This she knew how to do.

Sarah and Claire turned out to be a doubles team—seniors who'd been playing together since freshman year. They were good, sending the birdie back and forth in a rhythm that spoke to years of partnership.

"Want to join?" Sarah called.

Sophia stepped onto the court and hit her first shot—a clean overhead clear that sailed to the back line. Something settled in her chest. This was familiar. This was hers.

They warmed up for twenty minutes, then Coach Peterson—a compact woman in her forties with sharp eyes and a sharper voice—called them together.

"All right, ladies. Welcome back, welcome to our new players. This year we're aiming high—nationals, if we work for it. That means commitment, discipline, and pushing each other to improve."

She ran through the season schedule, tournament dates, practice expectations. Then: "Let's see what we're working with. Round-robin singles, first to eleven points. Maya, you're up first with Sophia."

Sophia felt everyone's eyes on her. The new girl, being tested immediately.

Maya grinned. "Don't hold back. I won't."

They took positions on opposite sides of the court. Sophia served—a high, arcing serve that Maya returned with power. The rally that followed was fast and brutal. Maya was good—really good—with powerful smashes and quick reflexes.

But Sophia had spent two years training against some of the best players in Ontario. She knew how to read opponents, how to anticipate patterns.

Maya's smash was predictable—always crosscourt when she was in the right corner. Sophia started anticipating, returning with drops that forced Maya to the net. The rallies got longer.

At 10-9, Sophia's favor, Maya sent up a high clear. Sophia jumped, twisted, and smashed. The birdie hit just inside the line.

"Point. Game to Sophia, 11-9."

They met at the net, both breathing hard.

"Okay, you're actually really good," Maya said, grinning. "Coach wasn't kidding."

"You too. That backhand was terrifying."

"Wait until you see my serve." Maya glanced at Coach Peterson, who was taking notes. "I think you just made varsity."

The rest of practice flew by. Sophia played three more matches—won two, lost one—and by the end she was exhausted and energized. This was what she'd needed. A space that was just hers, where she was valued for her skill, not for who she used to know.

In the locker room afterward, Maya appeared next to her.

"Hey, some of us are going for smoothies at Tall Grass Prairie. Want to come?"

Sophia's instinct was to say no. To protect herself from potential rejection or awkwardness. But Maya was looking at her with genuine friendliness, and saying no felt like closing a door she might need.

"Sure. Yeah, okay."

Twenty minutes later, she was squished into a booth at a trendy juice place with Maya, Sarah, and Claire, drinking something purple and probably extremely healthy.

"So," Claire said. "What brought you to Winnipeg?"

Sophia gave the abbreviated version—parents' jobs, last-minute move, starting junior year at new school.

"That's rough," Sarah said sympathetically. "Junior year too. Everyone's so established already."

"Yeah, I've noticed."

"How are you finding St. Paul's?" Maya asked.

"It's... big. Overwhelming."

"Do you know anyone?"

Sophia hesitated. "Actually, yeah. Ethan Price—we were friends when we were kids, before he moved here."

All three girls exchanged glances.

"Ethan Price," Claire said slowly. "The hockey captain."

"Yeah."

"You're friends with Ethan Price."

"We were friends. When we were nine. I don't know what we are now."

Maya leaned forward, interested. "But you've talked to him since you moved?"

"A few times. He's been... nice. Showing me around."

"That's good," Sarah said, but she sounded cautious. "Ethan's a good guy. Really popular, obviously. But genuine, you know? Not an asshole like some of the hockey players."

"He's also very taken," Claire added. "He and Becca Martinez have been together forever. Like, relationship goals forever."

"I know. I've met her."

"Right, of course." Maya took a long drink of her smoothie. "Sorry, we're not trying to be weird. It's just—the hockey players kind of exist in their own universe at St. Paul's. Separate ecosystem."

Sophia absorbed this information. "So me being friends with Ethan is weird?"

"Not weird," Sarah said carefully. "Just... unexpected. Hockey and everyone else don't really mix."

"But you're on the badminton team," Claire added quickly. "So you're automatically one of us. And we're way cooler than hockey."

"Objectively cooler," Maya agreed. "Better endurance, faster reflexes, and we don't smell like equipment bags."

They all laughed, and Sophia felt some of her anxiety ease. These were good people. Potential real friends.

"First tournament is in three weeks—Grand Forks," Maya said. "You should come. We make a weekend of it."

"I'll think about it."

"Think hard. We need you." Maya grinned. "Plus it's good to have friends outside the school bubble, you know? People who know you for you."

Sophia understood what she was really saying: You can have your hockey-player friend, but you should have other friends too. Friends in your own world.

"Thanks," she said. "For being welcoming. I was nervous about today."

"Please. You destroyed me in that match. You have nothing to be nervous about."

They stayed for another hour, talking about badminton and teachers and the weird dynamics of St. Paul's social hierarchy. By the time Sophia got home at 6:45, she felt lighter than she had since the move.

Her phone buzzed while she was doing homework.

**Ethan: How was badminton?**

**Sophia: Good. Made varsity, probably.**

**Ethan: Of course you did. Told you you were amazing.**

**Sophia: How was practice?**

**Ethan: Brutal. Coach is in playoff mode already. But good. Excited for tomorrow.**

**Sophia: Nervous?**

**Ethan: Always. But that's part of it. Can you come early? 6:30? Want you to meet the team properly.**

That was probably a bad idea. That was definitely crossing some kind of line from "old friends reconnecting" into "actively part of his life."

**Sophia: Okay. I'll be there.**

**Ethan: Perfect. See you then, Soph.**

She put her phone down and tried to focus on physics homework, but all she could think about was tomorrow. Watching Ethan play. Being in his world.

Maya's words echoed: *People who know you for you.*

Sophia had spent four days trying to figure out who she was in this new place. But sitting here alone in her room, she realized the truth: she didn't know yet. She was still becoming.

And maybe that was okay.

Tomorrow she'd watch Ethan play hockey. She'd see him in his element, doing the thing that defined his entire existence.

And maybe then she'd understand what it meant that he'd come back into her life.

Or maybe she'd just get her heart broken again.

Either way, she was going to find out.
