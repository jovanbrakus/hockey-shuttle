# Chapter 1: Then

## Age 9 - Millbrook Community Rink - March

The ice was perfect that morning.

Sophia Chen knew ice the way other kids knew their favorite books—by feel, by sound. This ice was smooth and hard, recently zambonied, with just enough texture that her blades could grip without fighting. She pushed off from the boards and glided across center, arms out for balance, feeling the cold air stream past her face.

"You're leaning left again!" Ethan's voice carried across the empty rink.

She stuck her tongue out at him but corrected her posture. Forces in equilibrium. Net force equals zero. That's what her dad always said about skating—you had to balance all the forces acting on your body or you'd fall.

Ethan laughed and skated toward her in that effortless way he had, like he'd been born with blades attached to his feet. Probably had been, knowing his parents. His hockey stick dragged behind him, leaving a thin line in the fresh ice.

"Better," he said when he reached her. "Now try the crossover again."

Sophia was nine years old and she hated crossovers. They made her feel clumsy and wrong, like her feet didn't know which way they were supposed to go. But Ethan was patient in a way that adults never were. He didn't sigh or check his watch or say things like "just try harder." He just skated beside her, matching her pace, breaking the movement down into smaller and smaller pieces until suddenly her body understood.

"Front foot pushes under," he said, demonstrating. "Back foot comes around and over. Think of it like... like a spiral. Or one of those DNA things Mrs. Patterson showed us."

"A double helix?"

"Yeah, that." He grinned at her. "Your feet are doing a double helix."

It was ridiculous.

Perfect.

Sophia tried again, thinking about DNA spiraling, and this time her feet cooperated. She made it halfway around the rink before she had to stop, breathing hard, her cheeks burning from cold and effort.

"You did it!" Ethan crashed into the boards beside her, sending up a spray of ice shavings. His helmet was crooked and his cheeks were red and he was smiling so wide she could see the gap where he'd lost a tooth last month. "That was perfect, Soph!"

Soph. Nobody else called her that. Her parents called her Sophia, always the full name, heavy with expectation. Her teacher called her Miss Chen. The other kids mostly didn't call her anything at all—she was too quiet, too focused on her schoolwork, too serious about the Learn-to-Skate program at the community center.

But Ethan called her Soph, like they were the kind of friends who had nicknames. Like they were the kind of friends who spent every Saturday morning at the rink, even though she was only in Learn-to-Skate and he was already in Novice hockey. Like they were the kind of friends who understood things about each other that other people didn't see.

"Race you to the blue line," she said.

"You're on."

They pushed off together, and Sophia knew she wouldn't win—Ethan was faster, stronger, had been skating since he was three—but it didn't matter. What mattered was the cold air in her lungs, the scrape of blades on ice, the way the morning sun came through the windows and made everything glow. What mattered was that for these few hours every week, she wasn't Sophia Chen, daughter of two PhD parents who expected perfection. She was just Soph, racing her best friend across fresh ice.

Ethan won, obviously. He always won. But he circled back for her, skating backward to match her pace, and said, "Getting faster."

"Still not fast enough."

"Fast enough for what?"

She didn't have an answer for that. Fast enough to keep up with you, maybe. Fast enough to be worth training with. Fast enough that when you make it to the NHL someday—because everyone said Ethan Price would make it to the NHL, even at nine years old everyone could see it—you'll remember the girl who used to race you at Millbrook rink.

But she couldn't say any of that out loud. So instead she said, "Fast enough to beat you someday."

"Maybe." He turned forward again, skating beside her now. "But I'm getting faster too."

They made slow laps around the rink, not racing now, just gliding. This was Sophia's favorite part—after the drills and the speed, when they just skated and talked and the whole rink belonged to them.

"Did you finish the math packet?" Ethan asked.

"Yesterday. Did you?"

"Last night. Number seventeen was weird."

"The one about the trains?" Sophia wrinkled her nose. "I think there's a mistake in it. The numbers don't make sense."

"That's what I thought!" Ethan's face lit up. "The second train would have to be going, like, two hundred miles an hour to make the answer work."

This was the other thing they shared, besides ice: numbers. Sophia loved math the way she loved physics, the way everything had rules and reasons and made sense if you just thought about it hard enough. Most of the other kids in their fourth-grade class groaned when Mrs. Patterson handed out the advanced math packets, but Sophia and Ethan leaned forward in their seats.

Last month, they'd both qualified for the regional Elementary Math Competition. They were the only two from Millbrook Elementary. Ethan's parents had taken them both to the competition in the city—an hour's drive, the farthest Sophia had ever been from home. They'd sat together in the back seat of the Prices' minivan, quizzing each other on multiplication tables and prime numbers, and Sophia had felt like she was part of something bigger than their small town.

She'd come in third. Ethan had come in first.

"We should tell Mrs. Patterson about the train problem," Sophia said now.

"Yeah. Maybe we can make up a better one."

They skated in silence for a while. The rink was starting to wake up—a few parents arriving early, dropping off kids for the 10 AM session. Soon the ice would be crowded with wobbly beginners and serious Novice players, and the magic of the empty rink would be gone.

"Hey Soph?"

"Yeah?"

Ethan slowed to a stop near the penalty box. His expression had changed—less happy, more serious. The look he got when he was trying to figure out a hard math problem or when his coach was yelling at him for missing a play.

"My dad wants to talk to your parents."

Sophia stopped too, confused. "Why?"

"He wants to ask them something. About me." Ethan fidgeted with his hockey stick, not meeting her eyes. "About hockey stuff."

"What kind of hockey stuff?"

"Just... stuff. Never mind." He pushed off again, faster now. "Come on, let's practice your backward skating."

But the moment felt wrong, like a wobble in her balance that she couldn't correct. Sophia followed him across the ice, but the perfect morning had shifted somehow, and she couldn't figure out why.

---

The conversation happened that afternoon.

Sophia wasn't supposed to hear it. She was supposed to be in her room, working on her book report about Sarah, Plain and Tall. But the Prices were sitting in their living room—a room they almost never used, with the nice furniture that nobody was allowed to sit on—and sound carried through the old heating vents.

She pressed her ear to the floor register and listened.

"—an incredible opportunity," Mr. Price was saying. His voice was deep and earnest, the same voice he used when he talked about Ethan's future at parent-teacher conferences. "The Winnipeg AAA program is one of the best in the country. They've produced three NHL players in the last five years."

"Ethan is very talented." That was her mother, in her careful professional voice. Dr. Lisa Chen, associate professor of chemistry, who chose every word like she was writing a research paper. "But he's only nine. Isn't that quite young to be thinking about professional athletics?"

"The window is small." That was Mrs. Price now, higher-pitched, urgent. "If we want Ethan to have a real shot, we need to get him into elite training now. The scouts start watching at twelve, thirteen. We can't wait."

"I understand." Her father this time, Dr. James Chen, physicist and the parent most likely to understand obsessive focus. "But why are you telling us this?"

A pause. Then Mr. Price said, "Because we want you to know that it's not about Ethan not wanting to spend time with Sophia. They're good friends. Good for each other, honestly. Both so bright."

Sophia's throat closed up.

"We're moving to Winnipeg," Mrs. Price said. "In two weeks. Paul's been transferred—it's a promotion, a good one—and the hockey program there is exactly what Ethan needs. But we wanted you to hear it from us first, not from the kids."

The silence that followed was terrible.

"Well." Her mother's voice was very controlled. "Thank you for telling us. Sophia will be... she'll miss him."

"They can stay in touch," Mr. Price said quickly. "Phone calls, maybe visits."

But Sophia knew how these things worked. She was nine, not stupid. Ethan would go to Winnipeg and join an AAA team and get busy with practices and games and tournaments. He'd make new friends, better skaters, kids whose parents understood hockey in a way her parents never would. He'd forget about the girl from Millbrook who could barely do crossovers and liked math competitions more than actual competitions.

She'd lose her best friend.

Sophia pulled away from the vent and lay flat on her bedroom floor, staring at the ceiling.

The grief came slowly. Not all at once like in movies, but in waves over the next few days. She'd be fine, and then she'd remember Ethan wouldn't be at school tomorrow, and her hands would go numb.

At school, she kept expecting to see him. In the cafeteria, at morning assembly, on the playground where they sometimes did math problems in the dirt with sticks. But he wasn't there. His desk in Mrs. Patterson's class sat empty, and nobody else even seemed to notice.

Sophia ate lunch alone. She walked home alone. She did her math homework alone, and every problem felt hollow because there was no one to compare answers with, no one to get excited about elegant solutions.

Her mother tried talking to her. "I know you're sad about Ethan leaving. It's okay to be upset."

But Sophia wasn't upset. Upset was too small a word.

Demolished.

Like something essential had been ripped out of her and she didn't know how to function around the hole it left.

She was nine years old, and her heart was breaking, and nobody understood that this wasn't just losing a friend. This was losing the only person who'd ever really seen her.

---

The last day came too fast.

It was a Tuesday, which meant no early morning ice time, but Ethan had begged his parents to let them go anyway. His mother drove them to the rink in silence, and Sophia sat in the back seat wondering if this was what heartbreak felt like. If nine-year-olds could have heartbreak. If you could miss someone who was sitting right next to you because you knew that in two days, they'd be four hundred miles away.

The rink was almost empty—just them and a figure skater practicing jumps in the far corner. Their blades echoed in the cold space.

"Want to race?" Ethan asked.

"Not today."

They skated slow laps instead, neither of them saying much. What was there to say? I'll miss you felt too small. Don't forget me felt too desperate. Everything Sophia thought of sounded wrong in her head.

"My new coach is supposed to be really good," Ethan said after a while. "His name is Coach Boychuk. He coached a guy who plays for the Jets now."

"That's cool."

"Yeah."

More silence. Another lap.

"You should keep skating," Ethan said suddenly. "You're getting really good. By the time you're in high school, you could probably play on a team or something."

Sophia didn't tell him that she was already thinking about quitting. That skating without him would feel like eating lunch alone in the cafeteria—technically possible but completely miserable.

"Maybe," she said.

"And you're definitely going to win at math competition next year. You only lost to me by, like, three points."

"Four points."

"Okay, four points. That's basically nothing." He turned to skate backward in front of her, that show-off move he'd mastered last month. "Promise me you'll keep doing it. The math stuff. Even if everyone thinks it's weird."

"Everyone already thinks it's weird."

"Everyone's stupid, then." He said it so matter-of-factly that Sophia almost smiled. "We're going to be scientists or engineers or something. We're going to do important stuff. Who cares what everyone else thinks?"

The figure skater landed a jump with a sharp crack of blades, and Sophia's vision tunneled.

"I don't want you to go," she said.

Ethan stopped skating. Just stopped, right there in the middle of the ice, and looked at her with an expression she'd never seen before. Sad and frustrated and something else she didn't have words for yet.

"I don't want to go either," he said quietly.

"Then don't."

"It's not—" He shook his head. "My parents already bought the house. My dad's starting his new job Monday. I already registered for the new school."

"So?"

"So I'm nine, Soph. I don't get to decide."

That was the worst part, Sophia thought. Being old enough to understand what you were losing but not old enough to do anything about it.

They skated until Mrs. Price called from the lobby that it was time to go. They took off their skates in silence. Ethan's equipment bag was already packed—he'd be leaving straight from here, heading home to finish packing the moving truck.

In the parking lot, standing by the minivan in the weak March sunshine, they faced each other awkwardly.

"I'll call you," Ethan said. "As soon as we get there and my dad sets up the phone."

"Okay."

"And maybe you could visit sometime. Winnipeg's not that far."

It was four hundred miles. It might as well have been the moon.

"Yeah," Sophia said. "Maybe."

Mrs. Price called for Ethan again. He picked up his equipment bag, hesitated, then dropped it and hugged Sophia quickly. It was clumsy and brief and smelled like hockey equipment and boy-sweat, and she wanted to hold on forever.

"See you around, Soph," he said.

Then he was in the van, and the van was pulling away, and Sophia stood in the parking lot of Millbrook Community Rink watching her best friend disappear down Oak Street.

She didn't cry. Not yet. She was too numb for crying.

The tears came later, that night, when she was alone in her bed and the reality settled in like ice forming over water. Ethan was gone. Really gone. And she'd never see him again, not really, because phone calls weren't the same and promises to visit always faded and people moved on.

She cried into her pillow so her parents wouldn't hear, great gulping sobs that shook her whole body. She cried for the Saturday mornings that wouldn't happen anymore, for the math competitions they'd never share, for all the conversations about nothing and everything that had made her feel less alone.

She cried until she was empty, and then she lay in the dark feeling hollow.

That night, her father knocked on her door late. He must have heard her after all.

"Hey, kiddo. Want to talk about it?"

"Not really."

He sat on the edge of her bed anyway. Dr. James Chen, professor of physics, brilliant researcher, completely hopeless at emotional conversations.

"Ethan will do well in Winnipeg," he said finally. "He's a talented kid. Dedicated."

"I know."

"You're talented too, you know. That math competition score was exceptional."

Sophia turned to look at him, eyes still swollen from crying. "Did you know I only beat him by four points?"

"Three points, actually. I saw the full results."

"He said four."

Her father smiled slightly. "He probably wanted you to feel better."

"That's stupid. The score is the score."

"Maybe. Or maybe he cared more about your friendship than about winning." He patted her shoulder awkwardly. "That's the kind of friend worth keeping, Sophia. Even at a distance."

After he left, Sophia pulled out her notebook—the one where she worked on extra math problems when she was bored or anxious—and tried to focus. But the numbers kept blurring.

She wondered what Ethan was doing right now. Packing boxes, probably. Or thinking about AAA hockey and Coach Boychuk and his big future. She wondered if he was thinking about her at all.

Nothing felt balanced anymore.

## Eight Years Later

## Age 17 - Present Day - Early September

The moving truck pulled into Winnipeg on a Saturday morning, and Sophia Chen felt like she was driving straight into the past.

"This is it!" Her mother's voice was aggressively cheerful from the front seat. "Our new adventure!"

Sophia stared out the window at the unfamiliar streets, her phone in her lap showing Ethan's Instagram profile.

She'd found it last night. @ethanprice23. Public account, because of course it was—hockey players needed visibility. The most recent photo was from two days ago: him in full gear, stick raised, celebrating what must have been a playoff goal. Caption: "Summer training starts Monday. Ready to work."

847 likes. 63 comments.

Before that: graduation photo with his arm around a girl. Beautiful, dark hair, perfect smile. Caption: "Couldn't have made it through without this one. Love you @beccamartinez."

Sophia had clicked through to Becca's profile. Student council president. Debate team captain. Every photo perfectly curated, showing a life of effortless achievement and social success.

Then she'd gone back to Ethan's page and scrolled further. Team photos. Workout videos. Pictures with friends at parties, someone's backyard pool.

He looked happy. Confident. Like someone who'd figured out exactly who he was supposed to be.

She'd almost sent a message: "Hey, moving to Winnipeg next week. Weird coincidence, right?"

But what if he didn't remember her? What if he did remember but didn't care? What if eight years was too long and they'd become completely different people?

So she'd closed Instagram and tried to convince herself it didn't matter.

"Winnipeg is bigger than I expected," her father said now, checking his phone's GPS. "Not city-huge like Toronto, but substantial."

Sophia locked her phone screen, Ethan's face disappearing. "Yeah."

"The house is just a few blocks from St. Paul's," her mother added. "You'll be able to walk to school."

St. Paul's High School. The same school Ethan attended. She'd checked the hockey team roster on their website: Ethan Price, Center, #23, Captain.

Of course he was captain.

"Junior year in a new city is going to be an adjustment," her father was saying. "But it's also an opportunity for a fresh start. You can be anyone you want to be."

Sophia didn't want to be anyone. She wanted to be invisible. She wanted to slip through the next two years unnoticed and get to college where maybe, finally, things would make sense.

But even as she thought it, she knew she was lying to herself. Because Ethan Price was here, at her new school, and there was no way she was going to be able to avoid him.

The question was whether she wanted to.

The truck turned onto their new street—tree-lined, quiet, the kind of neighborhood where people actually knew their neighbors. Their house was a two-story brick colonial, nice but not fancy, with a small front yard and a garage that her father was already eyeing for his woodworking projects.

"Home sweet home," her mother announced, pulling into the driveway.

Sophia climbed out and looked around. This was it. This was where she'd spend the next two years of her life. In the city where Ethan Price had become a hockey star with a perfect girlfriend and a predetermined future.

She pulled out her phone again, thumb hovering over Instagram. She could message him. Tell him she was here.

But fear stopped her.

Fear that he wouldn't respond. Fear that he would respond with polite disinterest. Fear that eight years had erased whatever they'd had.

"Sophia!" Her mother called from the front door. "Come see your room!"

She pocketed her phone and followed her parents inside, trying to ignore the way her heart was racing.

Everything was already in motion.

And she had no idea where it would take her.

---

That night, unpacking boxes in her new bedroom, Sophia's phone buzzed.

Text from Maya, her best friend from Brampton: **How's Winnipeg? Made any friends yet?**

**Sophia: Got here this morning. Mostly unpacked. No friends.**

**Maya: You'll find your people. Just takes time.**

**Sophia: Yeah.**

**Maya: You okay? You sound weird.**

Sophia sat on her bed, surrounded by half-empty boxes, and considered telling Maya the truth. That her childhood best friend was here. That she'd spent the last two days stalking his Instagram like a creep. That she was terrified of what Monday would bring.

Instead she typed: **Just tired. Long drive.**

**Maya: Get some sleep. Love you.**

**Sophia: Love you too.**

She put her phone down and stared at the ceiling of her unfamiliar room. Through the window, she could hear the distant sound of traffic, the rustle of leaves, the general hum of a city settling into Saturday night.

Somewhere out there, Ethan Price was doing whatever Ethan Price did on Saturday nights. Hanging out with his girlfriend, probably. Or his hockey teammates. Living the life he'd built here, completely unaware that the girl he used to teach crossovers to was now living four miles away.

Sophia closed her eyes and tried to sleep, but all she could see was nine-year-old Ethan saying "see you around, Soph" before driving away forever.

Except it hadn't been forever.

In two days, she'd walk into St. Paul's High School.

In two days, she might see him again.

And then she'd find out if those Saturday mornings at the rink had meant anything at all, or if they'd just been two lonely kids who'd found each other for a little while before real life pulled them apart.

Everything was tilting.

And Sophia Chen had no idea how to stop it.
