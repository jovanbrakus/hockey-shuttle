### Added Dialogue: Abuse Framing
**Location**: After cease-and-desist letter arrives (page 50-55 area)
**Key lines**:
```
Michael Chen: "This is textbook misogyny... This isn't about protecting
Ethan. This is about control dressed up in legal language. It's emotional
abuse using the legal system as a weapon."

Linda Chen: "We both know what this really is. Wealthy white man with
lawyers, using the system against an immigrant family."
```
