## Episode Synopsis
The brutal reality of their choice crashes down. Ethan is in Michigan at prep school hell, they're reduced to burner phones and coded emails. Sophia faces the weight of consequences: parents' disappointment, school gossip, Becca's dignified distance, and badminton as her only refuge. When Robert Price's lawyer sends a cease and desist letter demanding no contact, they find creative workarounds through Jordan. The strain builds toward breaking point until Valentine's Day, when Ethan does something impossibly reckless: shows up at her Minneapolis tournament, risking everything for three hours together. Their reunion is cut short when someone posts a photo to social media—and Robert is already on a plane to Minneapolis.

## Writing Notes

### Tone
- Winnipeg February cold as oppressive metaphor
- Exhaustion underlying everything
- Small moments of joy as survival
- Legal language as intimidation
- Teenage determination against adult power
- Valentine's Day romance cut through with terror

### Dialogue Style
- Burner phone whispers (intimate, urgent)
- Parent frustration (disappointed, protective)
- Maya's fierce loyalty (permission-giving)
- Jordan's practical help (less emotional, more action)
- Robert's cold control (legal, threatening)
- Ethan's letters (poetic, committed)

### Scene Balance
- 60% present action (school, calls, tournament)
- 25% emotional processing (breaking, recovering)
- 15% planning/conniving (Jordan's help, escape)

### Sensory Details
- Cold: bone-deep, relentless, numbing
- Phone vibrations: anxiety and relief
- Paper texture: letters as physical connection
- Court sounds: shuttlecock, shoes, breathing
- Arena lights: bright, exposing, theatrical
- Car heating: temporary warmth while fleeing

## Target Word Count Distribution
- **Chapter 1**: ~5,000 words (returning to separation reality)
- **Chapter 2**: ~5,000 words (legal threats and workarounds)
- **Chapter 3**: ~5,000 words (breaking point and resilience)
- **Chapter 4**: ~5,000 words (Valentine's tournament and chase)
- **Total**: ~20,000 words (80 pages)
