# CHAPTER 1: DISTANCE

## Previously On...

*Last episode: Ethan confronted his father after the winter tournament, refusing to cut Sophia out. Robert's ultimatum: Michigan prep school immediately or lose everything. Christmas together knowing separation was coming. New Year's Eve kiss before he left. She rejected MIT's early acceptance because being with him mattered more than any college. Now it's late January, and they're 800 miles apart.*

---

The whispers started before Sophia even reached her locker.

That particular quality of voices that aren't trying to be quiet, that want to be overheard. Monday morning, 7:45 AM. Her first day back at school since Ethan had been shipped to Michigan a week ago. She walked through the main entrance of Churchill High with her chin up and her expression carefully blank—the way you walk when you know everyone's watching.

"That's her."

"Heard Price sent his son away."

"Like, actually shipped him to another state."

"Can't believe she chose him over MIT."

Sophia kept walking. The hallway stretched ahead like a gauntlet, lined with faces that all seemed to turn toward her with synchronized precision. Some curious, some sympathetic, some just hungry for drama. She focused on the north stairwell at the end of the corridor. Counting steps.

Forty-three to the stairs. Forty-two. Forty-one.

Her locker was on the second floor, northeast corner. She'd calculated the route with the fewest people: north stairs, east hallway, third bay on the right. She'd memorized it last night lying awake at 2 AM, planning this walk like a military operation.

Someone had posted about Ethan leaving. Not the details—his family was too powerful for that—but enough. "E.P. transferring mid-year to Michigan prep school for hockey development. Guess some relationships aren't worth staying for." Posted Saturday night. 847 likes by Sunday afternoon. Dozens of comments Sophia hadn't read but could imagine.

Thirty-five steps. Thirty-four.

She'd dressed carefully this morning. Black jeans, gray sweater, her Canada Badminton jacket—armor of normalcy. Someone whose life was exactly as planned. She'd done her makeup to hide the exhaustion, the fact that she'd barely slept in seven days. Braided her hair the way she always did for competition: tight, controlled, nothing loose.

Twenty-eight steps. Twenty-seven.

"Sophia!"

Maya's voice cut through the whispers like a knife. Sophia's best friend waited at the base of the stairs, arms crossed, expression fierce. Maya Foster: transferred from Toronto two years ago, bonded with Sophia over shared love of science and mutual disdain for unnecessary drama. Right now she looked ready to fight anyone who so much as looked at Sophia wrong.

"Ignore them." Maya said as Sophia reached her. "Head up. You did nothing wrong."

"Feels like I did."

"Feelings aren't facts. Come on."

They climbed the stairs together. Maya positioned herself on Sophia's right—the side facing the hallway, blocking the worst of the stares. It was a small thing, that physical shield. Sophia's throat went tight.

"Did you see the post?" Sophia asked quietly.

"Saw it. Reported it. Got it taken down." Maya's voice was matter-of-fact. "Posted my own thing. 'Some people transfer schools for opportunities. Others stay stuck in gossip. Know which one you want to be.'"

"Maya, you didn't have to—"

"Yes, I did. Because I'm your friend and friends don't let friends walk through this alone."

Second floor. East hallway. The lockers here were newer, the light better. Fewer people. Sophia's shoulders relaxed fractionally. Her locker three bays down: number 237, covered in the periodic table stickers she'd put up freshman year when she'd been young enough to think that was cool.

Then she saw Becca.

Rebecca Morrison stood at locker 241, four down from Sophia's. Talking to Emma Chen (no relation) and Alyssa Park—the core of what used to be their friend group before everything got complicated. Before Ethan. Before Christmas. Before choices had to be made.

Becca looked up as Sophia approached. Their eyes met.

For a second, Sophia thought Becca might say something. They'd been friends since ninth grade. Studied together, competed in math competitions together, done science fair projects together. Becca had been at her house for dinner probably fifty times. Sophia had been at Becca's lake house every summer.

Becca's expression: carefully neutral. Not angry—that would have been easier. Just closed. She looked at Sophia with the polite distance of someone looking at a stranger in a grocery store, then deliberately turned back to Emma and Alyssa.

That dignified silence was louder than any confrontation could have been.

"Come on." Maya murmured, guiding Sophia past.

Sophia opened her locker on autopilot. Old textbooks and the lavender sachet her mom had insisted she hang there. She'd stuck a photo of her and Ethan on the inside of the door back in November—just the two of them at a hockey game, his arm around her shoulders, both smiling like they'd discovered something impossible. Looking at it now, the distance felt like a physical weight.

Eight hundred miles. Different time zone. Different life.

Her phone vibrated. Text from her mom.

*Have a good day. Remember we're here if you need to talk. Love you.*

Sophia stared at the message. Her parents had been careful with her since Ethan left. Careful the way you're careful around something breakable. The disappointment was still there—she'd rejected MIT's early acceptance, had thrown away something they'd worked toward for years—but under it was something else. Concern. Maybe even guilt.

She texted back: *Thanks. Love you too.*

"First period?" Maya asked.

"Calculus."

"Same. Let's go."

They walked together to Mrs. Patterson's classroom, arrived early, took seats in the back corner. Sophia pulled out her textbook and homework—perfectly completed, of course, because her academic performance was one thing she could still control. She'd done the problem sets lying in bed at midnight. Numbers didn't whisper. Equations didn't judge.

Other students filtered in. Some glanced at her, curious or sympathetic. Others ignored her entirely. Tyler Huang came in with his hockey friends, saw her, smirked. Ethan's teammate—former teammate now—had never hidden his opinion that Ethan was wasting his time with academics and relationships when he could be focusing on hockey.

"Heard your boyfriend got sent to Michigan." Tyler said loudly, dropping into his seat two rows ahead. "Bet that makes senior year easier for you. No distractions."

Sophia didn't respond. Kept her eyes on her textbook, on the elegant curves of the integral she'd completed last night.

"Just saying, sometimes things work out how they're supposed to. Price is where he needs to be. You're here. Clean break."

"Tyler." Maya said sharply. "Read the room and shut up."

"What? I'm just saying—"

"No one cares what you're saying. Turn around and focus on not failing calculus again."

Tyler's friends laughed. He scowled but turned back to face the front. Mrs. Patterson entered then. The class settled. Maya's hand squeezed Sophia's briefly under the desk—solidarity, support, grounding.

The class began. Derivatives of logarithmic functions. Sophia took notes with mechanical precision, her handwriting perfect, her attention divided between the board and the phone in her pocket that remained stubbornly silent.

---

Breakfast that morning had been a masterclass in tension.

The Chen family sat around their kitchen table in silence punctuated only by the clink of cutlery and the rustle of her father's newspaper. Her dad, Michael Chen, was reading the local section—deliberately not the sports section, Sophia noticed. He'd been avoiding hockey news for a week.

Her mother, Linda, ate her congee with delicate precision, eyes down. But Sophia could feel the weight of unspoken words hanging in the air between them like morning fog.

Tommy, her younger brother, fourteen and oblivious to subtlety, finally broke the silence. "Is everyone just going to be weird forever, or...?"

"Tommy." Their mother said quietly. "Eat your breakfast."

"I'm just saying, it's been like this for days. Nobody's talking. Nobody's—"

"Enough." Their father's voice: soft but final.

Sophia pushed rice around her bowl. She'd woken at 6 AM after four hours of fitful sleep. Showered, dressed, came downstairs to this tableau of family dysfunction. All because of choices she'd made. All because of a boy 800 miles away.

"I have early badminton practice. Coach Kim wants me there at 7."

Her mother looked up. "Sophia—"

"I'm fine, Mom."

"You look tired."

"I'm fine."

They looked at each other across the table. Linda Chen's expression was complicated—disappointment and love and worry all mixed together in a way that made Sophia want to cry or scream or both.

"MIT would have emailed back by now." Her father said quietly, still not looking up from his newspaper. "If you hadn't— if the acceptance was still active, we'd have heard about housing assignments. Financial aid details."

Sophia's hands tightened on her spoon. "I know."

"Do you?" Now he looked up. Michael Chen had the same dark eyes as his daughter, the same capacity for intensity. "Do you know what you've given up?"

"Michael." Her mother warned.

"She needs to understand—"

"I understand." Sophia said, her voice harder than she meant. "I understand that I made a choice. I understand what it cost. I understand you're disappointed."

"We're not disappointed in you. We're disappointed for you. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

Silence again. Tommy looked between them all with wide eyes, smart enough to stay quiet now.

"I have practice." Sophia repeated. She stood, carried her mostly-untouched bowl to the sink. "I'll be home by 4."

She grabbed her badminton bag from the mudroom—rackets packed and ready, because that at least was something she'd prepared last night—and headed for the door.

"Sophia." Her father called.

She stopped. Hand on the doorknob.

"We love you. You know that, right?"

She closed her eyes. "I know."

"We just want you to be happy."

"I know that too."

She left before the conversation could continue. Stepped out into the bitter January cold. Winnipeg winter: brutal and unforgiving. Minus twenty Celsius today, the kind of cold that stole your breath and made your lungs ache. The sky was that pale, washed-out gray that promised snow but never quite delivered. Everything felt frozen and waiting.

Her car was covered in frost. She scraped the windshield with numb fingers, watching ice fall away in sheets to reveal the glass beneath. Twenty minutes to the provincial training center. Twenty minutes of driving through empty morning streets with only her thoughts for company.

She got in. Started the engine. Cranked the heat. Sat waiting for the windshield to clear. Her phone on the passenger seat, screen blank.

No messages. No calls. No unfamiliar numbers.

The burner phone he'd promised was still hypothetical. He'd said he would find a way to call, but a week had passed with only one text from his regular number before he'd left: *On plane. Will find way to reach you. I promise. Love you.*

Seven days ago.

The windshield cleared. Sophia put the car in reverse and headed to practice.

---

The badminton court was sanctuary.

Coach Kim was already there when Sophia arrived at 6:50 AM. Setting up the net with practiced efficiency. Kim Young-mi: forty-three, former Korean national team member, competed in two Olympics before a shoulder injury ended her playing career. Immigrated to Canada fifteen years ago and built one of the best badminton programs in Western Canada.

She looked up as Sophia entered. Took in Sophia's expression in one glance. Nodded toward the changing room.

"Ten minutes. Then warm-up."

No questions. No sympathy. No gossip. Sophia's shoulders dropped an inch from where they'd been hunched near her ears.

The changing room was empty. Sophia put on her practice gear—black shorts, red tank top, her worn practice shoes with the grip she'd spent hours perfecting. Tied her hair back more securely. Looked at herself in the mirror. Same face as last week. Same eyes. But something in them looked older.

Back on the court, Coach Kim had music playing—instrumental, upbeat. Other players arriving: Sarah, training for nationals in the under-18 women's singles. Marcus and Jay, the men's doubles team. Elena, who played mixed doubles with her brother.

No one asked Sophia about Ethan. Either they didn't know, or Coach Kim had warned them off. Either way, Sophia was grateful.

"Footwork drills." Coach Kim announced. "Four corners, three minutes each station. Then shadow movements."

They spread across the courts. Sophia took position at her corner, racket ready. When the whistle blew, she moved.

Front court. Back court. Side to side. The shuttle wasn't even there but she chased its ghost—reaching, lunging, recovering. Her legs burned. Her lungs screamed in the dry, heated air. Physical pain was clean and simple. It had a purpose. It ended when you stopped moving.

"Faster." Coach Kim called. "Chen, you're holding back. Push."

Sophia pushed. Moved like the court was on fire and only motion would save her. Sweat dripped into her eyes. Her thighs trembled. Still she pushed.

"Time!" Coach Kim's whistle cut the air.

Sophia stopped. Bent double. Gasping. Her heart hammered in her chest. When she straightened, Coach Kim was watching her with those sharp eyes that missed nothing.

"You're playing angry."

"Using it." Sophia replied between breaths.

Coach Kim studied her for another moment, then nodded. "Good. But don't let it make you reckless. Anger is fuel. Don't let it be fire."

"Yes, Coach."

"Water break. Then court practice."

Sophia grabbed her bottle, drank deep. The cold water hit her overheated throat like a blessing. She closed her eyes, centered herself. On the court, she was just an athlete. Not a daughter who'd disappointed her parents. Not a girl whose boyfriend was 800 miles away. Not someone navigating gossip and judgment.

Just a player. Just this moment. Just the shuttle and the net and the precise geometry of movement.

"Chen!" Coach Kim called. "You're up with Sarah. Singles game to fifteen."

Sophia took position across from Sarah Kim, no relation to Coach. Sarah: seventeen, bound for University of Toronto on badminton scholarship, had beaten Sophia exactly once in competition. She grinned across the net.

"Heard you've had a rough week. Go easy on me?"

"No."

"Didn't think so."

The rally began. Sarah served long, testing. Sophia returned with a sharp cross-court drop shot that barely cleared the net. Sarah lunged, returned short. Sophia smashed from mid-court—power and precision combined. The shuttle hit the line with a crack.

"Point. Sophia leads one-zero."

They played. Sophia found her rhythm—the back and forth, reading Sarah's body language to predict shots, careful management of stamina and aggression. At the net: quick. From back court: powerful. Her smashes had velocity that came from somewhere deep and desperate.

"Fifteen-eight. Sophia wins."

She'd barely felt it. The points had blurred together into a continuous state of motion and reaction. Sarah was breathing hard, shaking her head with rueful admiration.

"Whatever's going on with you, bottle it for nationals."

Nationals. Right. In two months, she'd compete for the Canadian junior championship in the under-18 category. Last year she'd placed fourth. This year, Coach Kim thought she could medal.

If she could hold herself together that long.

Practice continued. Two hours of drills, games, conditioning. By the time Sophia showered and changed, her body was a mass of pleasant exhaustion and her mind was, finally, quiet.

She checked her phone in the parking lot: 9:15 AM. School started at 8:30 but she'd cleared the absence with the office yesterday—training exemption, one of the perks of being a nationally ranked athlete. She had second period free, then third period was chemistry.

She sat in her car with the engine running, heat blasting, phone in hand. Still no messages. Still no unfamiliar numbers.

He'd said he would find a way. She had to trust that.

The drive to school took fifteen minutes. She arrived at 9:40, parked, grabbed her bag. The building loomed ahead—brick and glass and the promise of whispers. She thought about the homework she'd completed, the tests she'd ace, the veneer of perfection she'd maintain.

She could do this. She'd done hard things before.

But when she walked back through those doors and felt the weight of stares again, she admitted the truth only to herself: nothing had been this hard before.

---

Her phone vibrated at 11:47 PM.

Sophia was lying in bed in the dark, staring at her ceiling. The glow-in-the-dark stars she'd put up when she was twelve making constellations she'd long since memorized. She wasn't sleeping. She hadn't really slept since Ethan left.

The phone vibrated again. Unknown number. Area code she didn't recognize.

Her heart stopped, then restarted at double speed. She grabbed the phone, answered.

"Hello?"

"Hi." His voice. Whispered, exhausted, but unmistakably his.

Sophia sat up, pressing the phone to her ear like she could pull him through it. "Ethan."

"Hi." He said again. She could hear the smile in his voice. "Sorry it took so long. Getting a burner phone at prep school is harder than you'd think."

"Where are you?"

"Bathroom. There's a bed check at midnight. I have thirteen minutes."

Thirteen minutes. After a week of silence, thirteen minutes felt simultaneously like forever and no time at all.

"Tell me everything. Tell me what it's like."

"It's—" He paused. Exhaled. "It's hell, Soph. Clinical and controlled and I swear they track every breath. The dorm is like a hotel—nice on the surface but completely soulless. My roommate is a junior whose dad is some NHL executive and he literally reports to his father every night about what I do. What time I sleep, what I eat, who I talk to."

"God, Ethan."

"Hockey practice is 6 AM and 8 PM. Between that is school, which is actually rigorous—they weren't lying about the academic side. Small classes, intense, lots of individual attention. But there's no freedom. Every minute is scheduled. Every activity monitored."

Sophia pulled her knees to her chest, curling around the phone. "Can you leave? Like, go off campus?"

"With permission and supervision, yeah. There's a mall fifteen minutes away. We can go on weekends if we've hit our training metrics for the week." His voice was dry. "So basically, no."

"And your phone?"

"They took it. Gave me a school phone that's monitored. All calls logged, all texts read. That's why I had to get this one. Bought it at the mall last Saturday during 'earned recreation time.'" The bitter emphasis on those last three words said everything about what he thought of the phrase.

"How did you even—"

"Cash that Jordan sent me. Long story. He's been helping."

Jordan. Sophia made a mental note to thank him. "The team?"

"Good. Really good, actually. These kids are headed for NCAA D1 programs. A few are already committed. The level of play is—" He paused. "It's what I'd need if I were serious about hockey as a career."

"Are you?"

"Serious about hockey? I don't know anymore." His voice dropped even lower. "A week ago I knew. Now I'm here and all I can think about is that I'm 800 miles away from you and I'm not allowed to call you and this was supposed to be what I wanted."

Sophia closed her eyes. "Don't. Don't do that."

"Do what?"

"Regret it. Regret choosing this. You're there because your dad forced you, not because you chose it."

"I'm there because I chose you. Because I wouldn't let him make me cut you out, so he made me go. That's still a choice."

"Then I'm here because I chose you too. And I'd choose you again."

Silence. Then: "Yeah?"

"Every time. Every version of this. You."

She heard him breathe out, shaky. "God, I miss you."

"Miss you more."

"Not possible."

"Definitely possible. I have empirical evidence."

He laughed, soft and fond. "You're giving me science arguments at midnight?"

"You love my science arguments."

"I really do." Another pause. "How's school? How are your parents? How's badminton?"

"School is complicated. Lots of gossip. Lots of stares. Maya's been great. Becca won't talk to me. Your old teammates think I'm a distraction who messed up your life."

"They're idiots."

"Agreed. But they're loud idiots." Sophia picked at a loose thread on her blanket. "My parents are disappointed. They won't say it directly but I can feel it. MIT would have sent housing information by now. They keep checking the mail like it might show up anyway."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I knew what I was doing." She said it firmly, as much to convince herself as him. "And badminton is good. Great, actually. I'm playing angry, Coach says. Using it."

"I bet you're terrifying on the court right now."

"Little bit."

"Wish I could see it."

"Wish you could too."

Silence fell, comfortable and aching all at once. Sophia looked at her alarm clock: 11:57 PM. His bed check was in three minutes.

"I have to go." Ethan said, reading her mind. "Bed check is random sweep. If they catch me with this phone—"

"I know. Go."

"Tomorrow? Same time?"

"I'll be awake."

"Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for answering. Thank you for being you. For still being here."

Her throat closed. "Where else would I be?"

"I don't know. I'm just scared sometimes that you'll realize this is too hard. That I'm not worth it."

"You're worth it." She said fiercely. "Every second of hard. Every piece of this. Don't doubt that."

"Okay." He sounded steadier. "Okay. I'll call tomorrow."

"Be safe."

"You too. I love you."

"Love you more."

"Not possi—" The call cut off.

Sophia sat in the dark, phone still pressed to her ear, listening to silence. Thirteen minutes had felt like thirteen seconds. Her whole body ached with missing him—physical, visceral, undeniable.

But he'd called. He'd found a way. He'd kept his promise.

She set the phone on her nightstand and lay back down. The stars on her ceiling glowed faintly. Cygnus, Lyra, Aquila—the Summer Triangle they'd talked about back in October, lying on the hood of his car looking up at the real sky. He'd taught her the myths. She'd taught him the science.

She could do this. She could handle the distance, the gossip, the disappointment. She could carry the weight of her choice.

As long as he called.

As long as his voice whispered across 800 miles of dark.

As long as they had thirteen minutes before midnight.

---

Tuesday was better. Or at least, less actively awful.

The whispers had faded to background noise. People were already moving on to new drama—apparently Tyler had hooked up with someone's ex at a weekend party, and that was more immediately interesting than Sophia's long-distance situation. She was grateful for the short attention span of high school gossip.

Chemistry class was awkward. She'd always partnered with Becca—they'd been lab partners since sophomore year, had the kind of natural rhythm where one of them could start a sentence and the other would finish it. Now Becca was partnered with Emma, and Sophia was paired with David Lin, a quiet kid who was brilliant at chemistry but had never said more than ten words at a time to her.

"So." David said as they set up their titration equipment. "Want me to handle the buret or the flask?"

"I'll do buret. Your handwriting is better for recording."

"Cool."

They worked in companionable silence. David was meticulous and careful. Sophia found herself relaxing into the familiar rhythm of lab work. Measure, mix, observe, record. Chemistry was reliable. Molecules behaved according to predictable rules. Reactions happened or they didn't, based on the properties of the substances involved, not on feelings or choices or the fact that the person you loved was 800 miles away.

"You okay?" David asked quietly, midway through their third trial.

Sophia glanced at him, surprised. "Yeah. Why?"

He shrugged. "You looked sad for a second. None of my business. Just checking."

It was such a simple thing—that quiet concern from someone who barely knew her. Sophia's throat went tight.

"I'm okay. Thanks for asking."

"Sure." He returned to his careful notation. They finished the lab in silence.

Lunch was her and Maya in their usual corner of the cafeteria. Maya had brought sushi from the good place downtown and was explaining her latest coding project—something about machine learning algorithms and natural language processing that was simultaneously over Sophia's head and fascinating.

"So basically," Maya said around a bite of salmon roll, "I'm teaching the computer to recognize sarcasm. Which is harder than you'd think because sarcasm is all about context and tone, and computers are terrible at subtext."

"Sounds like most people I know."

"Right? Like, if I say 'great job' with one tone, it's sincere. With another tone, it's scathing. How do you teach a machine that difference?" Maya gestured with her chopsticks for emphasis. "Language is wild."

"Have you tried training it on Twitter? That's like, concentrated sarcasm."

"Oh God, that's actually a great idea. I'm going to sound like the worst person alive after that dataset."

They laughed. For a moment, Sophia felt almost normal. Like she was just a girl having lunch with her best friend, talking about projects and possibilities, not carrying the weight of impossible choices.

"So." Maya said more carefully. "Have you heard from him?"

Sophia hesitated, then nodded. "Last night. Got a burner phone. Called at 11:47."

"How is he?"

"Surviving. Hating it. But surviving." Sophia picked at her sandwich. "He's got like, twelve minutes before bed check. That's all we get."

"That's brutal."

"Yeah."

"But you got to talk. That's something."

"It is." Sophia smiled, small but real. "It's everything, actually."

Maya reached across the table and squeezed her hand. "You guys are going to make it. I know it."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're both stubborn as hell and you love each other. That's a powerful combination."

Sophia wanted to believe her. Held onto that confidence like a lifeline.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of classes and homework and the ordinary rhythm of school. She aced a calculus quiz. She contributed thoughtfully to English class discussion of The Great Gatsby. She ignored Tyler's pointed stares and Becca's continued silence and the occasional whispers that still floated past her in hallways.

At 4:00 PM she went to badminton practice. Coach Kim worked them hard—conditioning drills, endurance training, match simulation. Sophia's legs were jelly by the time they finished at 6. She showered, changed, drove home in the dark winter evening.

Her parents were making dinner when she arrived. Her mom stir-frying vegetables, her dad setting the table. Tommy doing homework at the kitchen counter, headphones in. It looked almost normal.

"Hi, sweetheart." Her mom said. "How was practice?"

"Good. Coach thinks I'm ready for provincials next month."

"That's wonderful."

They ate dinner with careful conversation about school and practice and Tommy's upcoming science fair project. No one mentioned MIT. No one mentioned Ethan. The absence of those topics was loud but at least it wasn't hostile.

After dinner, Sophia retreated to her room. Homework, then reading, then lying in bed watching the clock tick toward 11:47 PM.

When her phone finally vibrated at 11:45, she answered before the first ring finished.

"Hi."

"Hi." Ethan said. He sounded a little more energetic tonight. "Okay, so you're going to appreciate this. The physics teacher here, Dr. Morrison, he's actually brilliant. Today we were talking about quantum mechanics and—"

"Wait, quantum mechanics in high school?"

"I know! It's an elective seminar. Only five students. And we got into this discussion about wave-particle duality and observation affecting outcomes, and I thought about you explaining interference patterns, remember? Back in October?"

Sophia smiled in the dark. "When you said physics was just math being pretentious?"

"I was wrong. Physics is math with an existential crisis, which is way more interesting."

"You're such a nerd."

"You love that I'm a nerd."

"I really do."

They talked about physics and hockey and the fact that Michigan winter was somehow colder than Winnipeg winter, which seemed impossible. They had eleven minutes tonight—one minute longer than yesterday, a small victory.

"Same time tomorrow?" Ethan asked as the minutes ran out.

"I'll be here."

"Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm going to figure out a way to see you. I don't know when or how but I will. This phone call thing—it's not enough."

Her heart hurt. "Ethan, you can't just leave. They're watching you."

"I know. But I'll find a way. I promise."

"Don't promise things you can't control."

"Too late. Already promised. I love you."

"Love you too. Be safe."

The call ended. Sophia lay in the dark, holding onto his promise like a secret. She didn't know if it was possible. She didn't know if they could survive months of this—twelve-minute phone calls and 800 miles and the weight of everyone's disappointment.

But tonight, she had his voice in her ear and his promise in her heart.

Tonight, that was enough.

---

Wednesday, the phone didn't ring at 11:45.

Or 11:50.

By 11:55, Sophia was sitting up in bed, panic rising in her chest. What if they'd found the burner phone? What if he'd been caught? What if his father had increased surveillance and Ethan couldn't get away?

11:57. Nothing.

11:58. Still nothing.

11:59. She was gripping her phone so hard her knuckles were white.

12:00. Midnight. The time of his bed check. He'd missed it. He wasn't calling. Something was wrong.

12:01. Sophia was halfway to texting Maya when her phone vibrated.

Unknown number. She answered on the first ring.

"Hello?"

"Hi." He sounded breathless, stressed. "God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Bed check was random tonight. They moved it up and I almost missed you—"

"Are you okay?"

"Got a demerit for being late to room. Worth it. Hi."

Relief hit her so hard she felt dizzy. "Hi."

"I thought I wasn't going to be able to call. I was literally running down the hallway. My roommate is going to report me and I don't care. Had to hear your voice."

"You're insane."

"About you? Yeah."

They had four minutes—shorter tonight because he'd been late, because the world wasn't fair about these things. But four minutes of his voice was infinitely better than the alternative.

When the call ended and Sophia lay back down, she understood something with absolute clarity: this was their new reality. Stolen moments. Whispered calls. The constant uncertainty of whether they'd connect.

And she'd take it. Every piece. Every minute.

Because the alternative was not having him at all.

And that was unthinkable.
