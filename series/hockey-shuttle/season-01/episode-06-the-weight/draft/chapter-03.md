# CHAPTER 3: BREAKING POINT

The crack appeared on a Wednesday morning in mid-February.

Sophia sat at her desk in calculus class, staring at a test she couldn't complete. The numbers swam on the page—derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions, problems she could normally solve in her sleep. But today her brain refused to cooperate. The equations looked like foreign language, symbols without meaning.

Mrs. Patterson was walking between desks, heels clicking on linoleum. Sophia tried to focus. She wrote out the first step of problem seven, then stopped. What came next? Chain rule? Product rule? The knowledge was there somewhere in her exhausted mind, but she couldn't access it.

"Ten minutes remaining," Mrs. Patterson announced.

Sophia looked at her paper. Four problems blank. Three more with only partial work. This was a disaster. She'd never failed a test in her life. Never even come close.

Her hand was shaking. She put down her pencil and pressed her palms flat against the desk, trying to ground herself. Breathe. Just breathe.

But breathing felt hard. Like the air wasn't reaching her lungs properly. Like there was a weight on her chest preventing full expansion.

"Five minutes."

Panic rising. Not now. Not here. She had to finish this test. Had to prove she was still capable, still excellent, still the student she'd always been.

She picked up her pencil again, forced herself to write. Numbers and symbols that might be correct, might be complete nonsense. She couldn't tell anymore.

"Time. Pencils down."

Sophia set her pencil down. Mrs. Patterson collected tests. When she reached Sophia's desk, she paused, glanced at the paper, and her expression flickered with concern.

"Sophia? Can you stay after class for a moment?"

Sophia nodded, not trusting her voice.

The rest of the class filtered out. Maya lingered in the doorway, questioning, but Sophia shook her head. Maya left reluctantly.

When the classroom was empty, Mrs. Patterson sat on the edge of her desk and looked at Sophia with kind, worried eyes.

"Want to tell me what's going on?"

"I'm fine."

"You left four problems blank and your work on the others is..." Mrs. Patterson chose her words carefully. "Uncharacteristic. You're usually my most consistent student."

"I just—I couldn't focus today. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. I'm not angry. I'm concerned." Mrs. Patterson tilted her head. "You look exhausted. Are you sleeping?"

Not really. Not more than four or five hours a night, broken by stress dreams and waking at 3 AM with racing thoughts. But Sophia couldn't say that.

"I'm fine," she repeated.

"Sophia, I'm going to let you retake this test next week. But I need you to talk to someone—school counselor, your parents, someone. Because you're clearly not fine, and I can't help if you won't let me."

Sophia's throat closed. The kindness was somehow worse than judgment would have been. She managed to nod, grabbed her bag, and fled the classroom before the tears could start.

She made it to the second-floor bathroom before breaking completely.

---

The bathroom was empty—small mercy in a day of mounting disasters. Sophia locked herself in the farthest stall, sat on the closed toilet lid, and let the sobs come.

She'd held it together for three weeks. Three weeks of legal threats and secret letters and maintaining perfect composure at school and home. Three weeks of late-night messages through Jordan and careful codes and constant vigilance. Three weeks of missing Ethan so intensely it was physical pain, while pretending to be fine.

And now she couldn't even pass a calculus test.

The sobs were ugly and wrenching, the kind that hurt your ribs and made you gasp for air. She pressed her hands over her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. Students were in class now but passing period was in twenty minutes. Someone would come in eventually.

She didn't know how long she cried. Long enough that her eyes were swollen and her throat raw. Long enough that she missed the beginning of her free period. Long enough that she didn't hear the bathroom door open or the footsteps approaching until someone knocked gently on the stall door.

"Sophia?"

Maya's voice. Of course it was Maya.

"Go away," Sophia managed.

"Not a chance. Open up."

"Maya—"

"I can stand here all day. Or you can open the door and let your best friend help. Your choice."

Sophia unlocked the stall. Maya took one look at her face and pulled her into a fierce hug.

"Oh, babe. Come on."

She guided Sophia to the sink, wet paper towels with cold water, pressed them gently to Sophia's eyes. The cold was shocking and grounding. Sophia took shaky breaths, slowly coming back to herself.

"What happened?" Maya asked quietly.

"Failed calculus test. Couldn't think. Brain just... stopped working."

"That's not failure. That's exhaustion." Maya kept the cool towels on Sophia's eyes. "You've been running on empty for weeks. Something had to give."

"I can't afford for something to give. I have to be perfect. I have to prove I didn't throw away my future for—" Sophia's voice cracked.

"For what? For love? For choosing yourself?" Maya pulled the towels away and made Sophia look at her. "You didn't throw away anything. You made a hard choice. That's different."

"Is it? Because MIT is gone. Ethan is in Michigan. His dad has lawyers threatening me. My parents are disappointed even though they won't say it. And I can't even pass a stupid calculus test—"

"Stop." Maya's voice was sharp. "Stop doing that. Stop catastrophizing. One test isn't your entire future. And MIT isn't the only school that matters."

"But it was—it was the dream. The plan. Everything I'd worked for—"

"Yeah, and plans change. Dreams evolve. That's allowed." Maya's expression softened. "You're seventeen. You're supposed to be figuring things out, not having your entire life mapped to the millimeter."

Sophia closed her eyes. "I'm so tired, Maya."

"I know."

"I'm tired of pretending I'm okay. Tired of codes and secret letters and checking my phone every five minutes. Tired of my parents looking at me like I'm fragile. Tired of people whispering. Tired of missing him so much I can barely breathe."

"Then stop pretending." Maya squeezed her shoulders. "With me, at least. You're allowed to not be okay. You're allowed to break. That's what best friends are for—catching you when you fall."

"What if I can't get back up?"

"You will. Because you're the strongest person I know. But you need to let yourself be human first." Maya checked her phone. "We have forty minutes of free period left. Let's get out of here."

"Where?"

"Anywhere but here. Come on."

---

They ended up at the park by the Red River, sitting in Maya's car with the heat running and indie music playing softly. The river was frozen solid, white and windswept, stretching between bare trees. February in Winnipeg was a particular kind of desolate—all the beauty of winter stripped away, leaving only cold and waiting.

Maya had brought emergency chocolate from her locker. Sophia ate it mechanically, the sweetness grounding.

"Okay," Maya said after a while. "Real talk. How bad is it really?"

Sophia considered lying, then decided she was too exhausted. "I don't know if we can survive this. The distance, the surveillance, the legal stuff. I don't know if love is supposed to be this hard."

"Love is supposed to be whatever it is. Sometimes it's easy. Sometimes it's work. Sometimes it's both." Maya unwrapped her own chocolate. "But the hard part isn't the love. The hard part is his dad being a controlling asshole."

"Same result though. We're still 800 miles apart. Still can't talk freely. Still facing another year of this before we're legal adults."

"So you're thinking of ending it?"

"I don't know what I'm thinking." Sophia's voice was small. "I just know I can't keep breaking down in bathrooms."

"Then don't. Let yourself actually feel things instead of bottling them up until they explode." Maya turned in her seat to face Sophia fully. "Look. I'm going to say something and you're not going to like it. But I'm saying it because I love you and someone needs to."

"Okay..."

"You're trying to be perfect. Perfect student, perfect daughter, perfect girlfriend. You're trying to prove to everyone—your parents, the gossips, maybe yourself—that choosing Ethan wasn't a mistake by being flawless in every other way. But that's impossible. And trying to do the impossible is what's breaking you."

Sophia wanted to argue. Couldn't. Because Maya was right.

"So what do I do?" she whispered.

"You let yourself be a person who's going through something hard. You accept help. You lower your impossible standards. You tell people when you're struggling instead of pretending until you crack." Maya's voice gentled. "And you stop measuring your worth by whether you're perfect."

"But if I'm not perfect, then what was the point? If I'm not excellent at everything else, then what I gave up—"

"Sophia. Listen to me. What you gave up was one school. One acceptance. That's not your entire worth or your entire future. You're still brilliant. You're still going to get into amazing schools. You're still going to do incredible things. MIT was a possibility. It wasn't your entire identity."

"Feels like it was."

"Because you're exhausted and in crisis. But it wasn't." Maya pulled out her phone, started typing. "Dr. Reeves asked me to recruit you for Science Olympiad. I was going to wait, but I think you need this now."

"Science Olympiad?"

"Regional competition next week in Minneapolis. Physics, chemistry, biology events. I'm on the team. We need someone strong in physics, and you're the best we've got." Maya showed her phone screen: email from Dr. Reeves, the physics teacher, specifically asking about Sophia's interest.

"I can't add another thing—"

"It's not adding something. It's refocusing energy you're already spending on academics into something structured and challenging. Give your brain problems to solve instead of catastrophes to spiral about." Maya's expression was earnest. "Plus it's next Saturday. Minneapolis. Which is where badminton tournament is next Sunday. Your coach already asked about competing, right?"

Sophia had forgotten about that. Coach Kim had mentioned the Minneapolis Invitational—good warmup for nationals in March. She'd said yes without really thinking about it.

"Yeah. I'm competing Sunday."

"So Science Olympiad Saturday, badminton Sunday. Full weekend of focusing on things you're good at, with me there to support. What do you say?"

It sounded exhausting and perfect in equal measure. Structure. Purpose. Problems with solutions.

"Okay," Sophia heard herself say. "I'll do it."

"Yeah?" Maya's face lit up.

"Yeah. But I need to tell you something first." Sophia took a breath. "Jordan got another letter from Ethan this week."

"And?"

"And Ethan knows about Minneapolis. The competition, the tournament. He says..." She couldn't finish.

"He says what?"

"He says he has a plan. For Valentine's Day weekend."

Maya's eyes widened. "Valentine's Day is February 14th. That's next Saturday."

"I know."

"Minneapolis is eight hours from Michigan."

"I know."

"He can't possibly—"

"He says he has a plan." Sophia pulled out the latest letter from her bag, handed it to Maya. "Read it."

Maya read, her expression cycling through surprise, concern, and something like admiration.

*Lyra,*

*The distance between us is eight hours by car, but I calculated it: only 640 miles. In stellar terms, that's nothing—basically the same star system. And Valentine's Day is a Saturday this year. Science Olympiad and badminton invitational in Minneapolis. I know because Jordan told me about your competitions.*

*I know you're thinking: impossible. Prep school won't let me leave. Surveillance is constant. Dad tracks everything.*

*But here's the thing about surveillance—it has patterns. Blind spots. And I've been studying them. Weekend activities require permission but sometimes I've built enough goodwill. If I say family emergency, one weekend pass is possible. Eight hours to Minneapolis, eight hours back. Sixteen hours total. If I leave Friday night, arrive early Saturday morning, I could have most of the day. See your competition. Maybe even see you.*

*I know it's risky. I know if they find out, consequences will be severe. But Lyra—I need to see you. Not just hear your voice or read your words. I need to see your face and hold your hand and know this is real. Know we're surviving this.*

*I can't promise it'll work. But I'm going to try.*

*If you don't want me to—if it's too dangerous or you're not ready—send me letter that says "constellation map incorrect." I'll understand. I'll stay away.*

*But if you want me to try, send letter that says "orbital calculations look promising." And I'll move heaven and earth to be there.*

*—Cygnus*

"Oh my God," Maya breathed. "He's going to drive eight hours to see you for what, a few hours?"

"Maybe. If it works. If I tell him to try."

"Are you going to tell him to try?"

Sophia looked out at the frozen river, at the desolate beauty of February in a city that knew how to survive winter. She thought about breaking down in calculus class. She thought about his letter saying *I need to know this is real*. She thought about the fact that love was supposed to be whatever it was, including hard, including impossible, including worth fighting for.

"Yeah," she said. "I'm going to tell him to try."

Maya whooped, startling her. "You're going to see him! Actual seeing, not just letters!"

"If it works. If he can get away. If we don't get caught—"

"We won't get caught. We'll be smart. Strategic. And I'll be there to help." Maya was already planning, Sophia could see it in her eyes. "Science Olympiad is Saturday morning through early afternoon. Badminton tournament is Saturday evening through Sunday. If he comes Saturday, you'll have afternoon between events. We can make this work."

"What if his dad finds out?"

"Then we deal with it. But Sophia—don't you want to see him? Actually see him?"

Sophia closed her eyes. God, yes. She wanted it more than she wanted perfect test scores or MIT acceptances or any of it. She wanted to see his face in person, not just in memory. Wanted to hear his voice not through a phone but right in front of her. Wanted to touch him and be real to each other instead of just words on paper.

"I want it so much it terrifies me," she admitted.

"Then let's be terrified together. And let's make it happen." Maya started the car. "Come on. We're skipping the rest of the day. I'm taking you home, you're going to sleep for actual hours, and then you're going to write that letter telling him yes."

"Maya—"

"Nope. No arguing. Best friend executive decision. You need rest, then you need hope. In that order."

Sophia didn't argue. She let Maya drive her home, let her explain to Sophia's mom that she'd had a rough day and needed rest. Her mom—bless her—asked no questions, just made tea and sent Sophia to bed.

Sophia slept for four hours straight and woke feeling slightly less like she was drowning.

She wrote the letter that evening:

*Cygnus,*

*Orbital calculations look promising. I'll be there. Be careful. Be smart. But come.*

*—Lyra*

She mailed it the next day.

And then she waited.

Science Olympiad practice became Sophia's salvation.

Dr. Reeves ran the team with cheerful intensity, organizing students into specialized events based on their strengths. Sophia was assigned to physics events: Machines, Trajectory, and Circuit Lab. Maya was doing Computer Science and Code Busters.

The team met after school three days a week. They were a nerdy bunch—twelve students ranging from freshmen to seniors, all intensely smart and unconcerned with social hierarchies. No one asked Sophia about her relationship drama. No one whispered about legal threats. They just cared whether she could calculate projectile motion under air resistance and explain mechanical advantage.

It was exactly what she needed.

"Okay," Dr. Reeves said during Thursday practice. "Trajectory competition Saturday. Sophia, you'll be paired with Marcus Chen." He grinned at the coincidence of the shared surname. "No relation?"

"Not unless I have a secret brother," Sophia said, and Marcus laughed.

Marcus Chen was a sophomore, small and quick with perpetually messy hair and a calculator watch he wore unironically. He reminded Sophia of Ethan, actually—same intensity about problem-solving, same tendency to get excited about physics concepts.

They spent an hour calibrating their catapult, testing angles and tensions. The goal was to hit a target at unknown distance with a ping-pong ball. Points for accuracy, bonus for speed.

"Okay, so if we assume initial velocity of 12 meters per second at 45-degree angle, and we account for air resistance coefficient of 0.4..." Marcus was scribbling equations.

"But we can't assume resistance coefficient," Sophia pointed out. "Air density varies with humidity and temperature. Minneapolis in February will be different from here."

"True. So we need to build in adjustability. Variable tension on the elastic?"

"And calibration system we can run on-site before competition."

They worked together with the ease of people who spoke the same language. By the end of practice, their catapult was hitting targets with 85% accuracy.

"Nice work," Dr. Reeves said, inspecting their setup. "You two are going to crush it in Minneapolis."

Minneapolis. Where Ethan might be. Where she might actually see him.

The thought made her hands shake. Marcus noticed, steadied the catapult.

"You okay?"

"Yeah. Just tired."

"Fair. But hey—thanks for joining team. Maya said you needed convincing."

"Maya's persuasive."

"She's scary when she wants something. But she's right about you being good at this." Marcus grinned. "Plus it's fun, right? Just solving problems. No drama."

"No drama," Sophia agreed. "Just physics."

That night, Jordan texted: *Hey, that chemistry homework from last week? Friend of mine confirmed the calculations work out. Should happen Saturday morning.*

Sophia stared at the message. Translation: Ethan confirmed. He's coming Saturday morning.

She texted back: *Thanks for checking. Good to know.*

Then she sat on her bed and tried to slow her racing heart.

One week. Seven days until she'd see him.

Seven days to not fall apart.

---

Friday, five days before Minneapolis, Sophia had a breakthrough.

She retook the calculus test at lunch—Mrs. Patterson's offer of a do-over. This time, her mind cooperated. The equations made sense again. She solved every problem with the confidence of someone who remembered who she was.

She turned it in with ten minutes to spare. Mrs. Patterson graded it during her planning period and called Sophia back after school.

"Ninety-six percent," Mrs. Patterson said, showing her the paper. "This is the Sophia I know."

"Thank you for letting me retake it."

"Thank you for getting whatever rest you needed." Mrs. Patterson's expression was knowing. "You look better. Less exhausted."

"I am. A little." Sophia hesitated. "Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"How do you know when you're making a mistake versus when you're just doing something hard?"

Mrs. Patterson considered this. "Mistakes feel wrong even when they're easy. Hard things feel right even when they're difficult. Why?"

"Just... trying to figure something out."

"Does it feel right? The thing you're trying to figure out?"

Sophia thought about Ethan's letters, about the countdown to Saturday, about the way she smiled when Jordan passed her coded messages. "Yeah. It feels right."

"Then it's probably just hard. And hard is worth it, usually." Mrs. Patterson smiled. "Go on. Get to practice or wherever you need to be."

Badminton practice was intense. Coach Kim was preparing them for Minneapolis, running drills on court speed and shot variation.

"Chen, you're fast, but you're not reading your opponent," Coach Kim called. "Watch their body language. Weight shift tells you direction before they hit."

Sophia focused. She watched Sarah's feet, her shoulders, the angle of her racket. Started anticipating shots before they happened. Started winning points she would have lost a month ago.

"Better," Coach Kim approved. "Remember this in Minneapolis. Tournament field will be strong. You need every advantage."

After practice, Sophia stayed to work on serves. Coach Kim came over, racket bag slung over her shoulder.

"You're playing better this week. Something changed."

"Got some sleep. Joined Science Olympiad. Gave myself something to focus on besides..." Sophia trailed off.

"Besides long-distance relationship with boy whose father doesn't approve?" Coach Kim's voice was dry but not unkind.

Sophia stared. "How did you—"

"I read. Also I'm not deaf. Athletes gossip too." Coach Kim adjusted her bag. "For what it's worth, I think you're handling it well. Could have fallen apart. Didn't. That's character."

"Thank you, Coach."

"Just don't let it make you reckless. On court or in life." Coach Kim's look was pointed. "Focus is good. Distraction is dangerous. Know the difference."

She left before Sophia could respond. But the message was clear: Coach Kim knew something was happening in Minneapolis. And she was warning Sophia to be careful.

Sophia would be careful. But she was also going to see Ethan.

Some risks were worth taking.

---

The weekend before Minneapolis passed in a blur of preparation and anticipation.

Sophia finalized Science Olympiad materials with Marcus. They packed their catapult carefully, tested it one final time, ran through calculations until they could do them in their sleep.

She also prepared for badminton—checked her equipment, packed her competition gear, reviewed tournament brackets. The Minneapolis Invitational was mid-tier competition, good players but not national-level intensity. She should be able to medal if she played smart.

And through it all, she thought about Saturday. About the moment when she'd look up and see him. About what they'd say. About how much time they'd actually have.

Jordan delivered one more letter Thursday night:

*Lyra,*

*Told prep school my aunt in Minneapolis is sick—family emergency. They cleared me for weekend leave Friday evening through Sunday morning. Bus schedule has me arriving Minneapolis 6 AM Saturday.*

*Science Olympiad starts 9 AM at convention center. I'll find you. Don't look for me—I'll look for you. Less obvious that way.*

*After your event ends, if you can get away for even an hour, I'll take it. I have to be on return bus by 7 PM Saturday night. So we have about ten hours in the same city, maybe three where we can actually be together.*

*Three hours. That's it. But it's everything.*

*Be careful. Be smart. I love you.*

*—Cygnus*

Three hours. After six weeks apart, three hours felt like both forever and nothing.

Sophia wrote back:

*Cygnus,*

*Science Olympiad runs 9 AM - 2 PM. Badminton starts 6 PM. Between is ours. I'll find way to get free. Maya will help.*

*Three hours is enough. Three hours is everything.*

*See you Saturday. I love you.*

*—Lyra*

Friday morning, the Science Olympiad team loaded into school vans for the drive to Minneapolis. Eight hours on the road, arriving late evening, checking into host hotel. Competition tomorrow, then drive home Sunday.

Sophia's parents had signed the permission form, had helped her pack. Her dad had pulled her aside before she left.

"Be smart this weekend," he'd said quietly.

"I will be."

"I know you're going to see him. Don't tell me details. But be smart."

She'd hugged him hard, grateful he understood. Grateful he was letting her make this choice.

The drive was long but good. Maya kept Sophia entertained with increasingly elaborate theories about quantum computing. Marcus and the other team members played road trip games. Dr. Reeves drove with patient good humor, occasionally contributing science facts that sparked debates.

They arrived in Minneapolis at 8:30 PM, checked into the hotel, ordered pizza, and settled in for final preparation. Sophia shared a room with Maya, and after lights out they lay in their respective beds in the dark.

"You okay?" Maya asked.

"Terrified."

"Yeah?"

"What if he can't get away? What if we get caught? What if—"

"Sophia. Breathe. Whatever happens tomorrow, we handle it. Together."

"Together," Sophia repeated.

She barely slept. Every time she closed her eyes she imagined scenarios: seeing him across the convention center, stolen moments in quiet corners, his arms around her for the first time in six weeks.

Or alternatively: his dad showing up, lawyers appearing, everything crashing down.

At 5:30 AM, she gave up on sleep. Showered, dressed in Science Olympiad team shirt and jeans. Did her hair, minimal makeup, trying to look normal. Hands shaking the whole time.

Maya was already dressed, looking at her phone.

"Jordan texted. Bus arrived on time. He's there."

Sophia's heart stopped. "Where?"

"Convention center. Waiting."

"Oh God."

"Hey." Maya crossed to her, took her shoulders. "You're going to be fine. You're going to compete, you're going to be brilliant, and then you're going to see your boyfriend. In that order. Okay?"

"Okay."

They went downstairs to breakfast with the team. Sophia ate mechanically, not tasting anything. Marcus was reviewing equations. Dr. Reeves was giving final pep talk.

At 8:30 AM, they loaded into vans and drove to the convention center.

And Sophia's countdown reached zero.
