# CHAPTER 4: VALENTINE'S RECKLESSNESS

The Minneapolis Convention Center was chaos.

Three simultaneous competitions occupied different floors: Science Olympiad in the basement conference rooms, a robotics tournament on the main floor, and badminton in the arena upstairs. Hundreds of students, coaches, and parents flowing through hallways with the organized confusion of academic competition day.

Sophia walked with her team through the main entrance at 8:45 AM, equipment bags and nervous energy making them louder than usual. Dr. Reeves was checking them in, collecting schedules, organizing their scattered focus into something resembling readiness.

"Trajectory competition starts at 10:30," he told Sophia and Marcus. "You have your event at 11 AM in Room B-7. Circuit Lab at 1:15 PM. Stay hydrated, stay focused, and remember—this is supposed to be fun."

"Fun," Marcus repeated skeptically. "Right."

"Fun-adjacent," Dr. Reeves amended with a grin. "Go set up. You have forty-five minutes."

The basement conference rooms were fluorescent-lit and windowless, filled with folding tables and the particular smell of school buildings everywhere. Teams clustered by school, setting up equipment and running final tests. Sophia and Marcus found their assigned table, began carefully unpacking their catapult.

Sophia's hands were steady as she assembled the base, attached the elastic, calibrated the release mechanism. This was familiar. This was something she could control. The physics of trajectory, the mathematics of projectile motion, the precision of engineering—these were solid and knowable.

Unlike everything else in her life right now.

"Okay, so we need to test air resistance coefficient," Marcus said, pulling out their calculator. "Temperature in here is probably 21 Celsius, humidity feels low..."

They worked together, falling into the comfortable rhythm they'd established during practice. Test launches, measurements, tiny adjustments. Their catapult was performing well—consistent velocity, predictable arc. They'd do well today.

Sophia was so focused on the work that she almost missed him.

Almost.

But some part of her brain—the part that had been tuned to his frequency since October—registered his presence before she consciously saw him. The air in the room changed. She looked up.

Ethan Price stood in the doorway.

Time did that movie thing where it slowed down and everything else went soft-focus. He was there, solid and real, wearing jeans and a dark blue hoodie and a baseball cap pulled low. He was scanning the room, methodical, and when his eyes found her they stopped.

She watched him take a breath. Watched his expression shift from tense to something like relief mixed with longing. He didn't smile—too many people, too risky—but his eyes said everything his face couldn't.

*Hi. I'm here. I made it. You're real.*

She couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Just looked at him across thirty feet of conference room and felt the distance of six weeks collapse into nothing.

"Sophia?" Marcus's voice pulled her back. "You good?"

"Yeah." She forced herself to look away, back to the catapult. "Yeah, sorry. Thought I saw someone I knew."

"Cool. So this launch angle, I think we should—"

But Sophia wasn't listening anymore. Her entire awareness was on the boy in the doorway who was now moving along the back wall, staying out of the main traffic, finding a position where he could watch without drawing attention. He was wearing a visitor pass—probably said he was there to observe, thinking about joining Science Olympiad next year, something plausible and boring that wouldn't raise questions.

He'd thought this through. He'd planned.

And he was here.

"Five minutes to competition start!" A judge's voice boomed through the room.

Sophia forced herself to focus. She had a competition to win. Then she'd have time. Three hours, if his letter was accurate. Three hours in the same city, the same building, maybe even the same room.

She could last through one physics competition.

---

Trajectory went perfectly.

She and Marcus were synchronized, efficient, confident. They measured the target distance in seconds, calculated optimal trajectory, adjusted their catapult with practiced precision. First launch: 8.2 centimeters from center. Second launch: 3.1 centimeters. Third launch: dead center.

"Churchill High scores 27 points!" the judge announced. "Current tournament leader!"

Marcus high-fived her, grinning. Other teams applauded politely, some with jealous side-eyes. Sophia felt the satisfaction of competence, of problems solved correctly. This was who she was—someone who could calculate angles and predict outcomes and hit targets under pressure.

She glanced at the back of the room. Ethan was still there, leaning against the wall with apparent casualness, but she could see the tension in his shoulders, the way his hands were shoved deep in his pockets. He'd watched the whole thing. He was proud of her—she could see it even from across the room.

"Circuit Lab is in an hour," Marcus said, already packing up their catapult. "Want to grab food?"

"You go ahead. I need to..." Sophia scrambled for excuse. "Bathroom. Then I'll meet you in the cafeteria area."

"Cool. Text if you can't find it."

Marcus headed out with the other team members. Dr. Reeves was talking to judges, reviewing scores. Maya appeared at Sophia's elbow, having finished her Code Busters event.

"He's here," Maya whispered.

"I know."

"Back wall. Blue hoodie. Has been watching you like you're the only person in the room."

"Maya—"

"Go. You have an hour before next event. I'll cover with Dr. Reeves." Maya squeezed her arm. "Go."

Sophia went.

She walked out of the conference room, trying to look casual, like she was just heading to the bathroom or food court or anywhere that wasn't following the boy in the blue hoodie. She didn't look back to see if he was following. Just walked.

The hallway was crowded with students between events. Sophia navigated through them, heart pounding, heading toward the east stairwell that looked less trafficked than the main areas. She climbed to the ground floor, kept walking, found an alcove near the vending machines that was relatively quiet.

She stopped. Waited. Counted her breaths.

Ten seconds. Twenty.

Then footsteps behind her.

She turned.

Ethan stopped ten feet away. Neither of them moved. They just looked at each other—really looked, taking in every detail that photos and memories couldn't quite capture. He looked tired, she noticed. Shadows under his eyes, tension around his mouth. But also solid, real, here.

"Hi," he said quietly.

"Hi," she managed.

"You were magnificent back there. That third shot—perfect calculation."

"Math doesn't lie."

"No. It doesn't." He took a step closer. Then another. "Can I—is it safe to—"

"Not here. Too many people." Sophia glanced around, saw a door marked "Equipment Storage - Staff Only." Probably locked, but worth trying.

It wasn't locked. Small miracles.

They slipped inside, and Sophia locked the door behind them. The room was small, filled with folding chairs and spare podiums and the forgotten debris of countless conventions. A single window high on one wall let in gray February light. And they were alone.

Completely, finally alone.

Ethan pulled off his baseball cap, ran a hand through his hair. "God, it's good to see you."

"How are you even here?" Sophia's voice shook. "Eight hours on a bus, lying to prep school—"

"Had to. Couldn't do another week of letters and codes and missing you." He took a step toward her. "Had to know this is real. That you're real. That we're—"

She closed the distance and kissed him.

His arms came around her instantly, pulling her against him like she might disappear if he didn't hold on tight enough. She gripped his hoodie, kissed him with six weeks of longing and desperation and relief that he was solid and here and hers.

When they finally broke apart, both breathing hard, she realized she was crying.

"Hey," Ethan said softly, wiping her tears with his thumbs. "Hey, don't cry."

"Can't help it. You're here. You actually came."

"Told you I would." He rested his forehead against hers. "Told you I'd find a way."

They stood like that, just breathing together, hands tangled in fabric and hair, reassuring themselves through touch that this wasn't another dream or letter or phone call. This was real.

"Tell me everything," Sophia said finally. "Tell me what it's really like."

They sat on the floor, backs against the wall, shoulders pressed together. Ethan talked in low, urgent tones about prep school reality: the surveillance that was somehow worse than his letters made it sound, the roommate who'd been moved after reporting Ethan's burner phone call, the new roommate who was sullen but minded his own business. The hockey that was excellent and exhausting, the academics that were rigorous but soulless, the constant feeling of being watched.

"But the worst part," Ethan said, "is that it's working. The hockey program, I mean. I'm getting better. Faster, stronger, smarter about the game. Coaches think I could get Division I scholarship offers by senior year. So my dad's strategy is succeeding—shipping me away, forcing focus, eliminating distractions. It's all working exactly how he planned."

"Except for the part where you're miserable."

"Except for that." He smiled without humor. "But he doesn't care about that part. Just results."

"Have you talked to him? Since you left?"

"Weekly check-in calls. Fifteen minutes. He asks about metrics—practice stats, academic grades, coach feedback. Never asks how I'm doing. Never asks if I'm happy." Ethan's voice was flat. "It's like talking to a performance review software."

Sophia took his hand, laced their fingers together. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. This is his choice, not yours. You didn't make him be this way."

"But I'm the reason he's punishing you."

"No. His need for control is the reason he's punishing me. You're just the thing he can't control." Ethan lifted their joined hands, kissed her knuckles. "And I'm glad. I don't want him to control this. This is mine. Ours."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment. Then Sophia told him about her side—the cease and desist letter, her parents' careful support, Jordan's help, Maya's fierce loyalty. The breakdown in calculus class and the salvation of Science Olympiad. Coach Kim's knowing looks and Tyler's continued smug judgment.

"And Becca?" Ethan asked. "Still not talking to you?"

"Still not. I think..." Sophia considered. "I think she's hurt. Like she thinks I chose you over our friendship. Which isn't true, but I understand why it feels that way to her."

"You miss her."

"Yeah. I do. But I'd make the same choice."

"That's what I told my dad. When he was sending me to Michigan, he said I was throwing away opportunities for a girl. I told him I wasn't throwing away anything—I was choosing what mattered." Ethan's voice was quiet but certain. "You matter more than his plans. More than hockey. More than any of it."

"Hockey matters to you though. You said yourself you're getting better—"

"I am. And I like it. I like playing at this level, like the challenge. But Soph—" He turned to face her fully. "I don't want to be good at hockey just because it's what I'm supposed to want. I want to figure out what I actually want. And the only time I feel like myself, like I know who I am, is when I'm with you."

She kissed him again, slower this time. Soft and careful and full of all the things she couldn't quite say. When they pulled apart, she checked her phone: 11:42 AM.

"I have Circuit Lab at 1:15," she said regretfully.

"How long does that run?"

"Forty-five minutes, maybe an hour."

"So we have..." Ethan calculated. "Thirty-three minutes now, then ninety-minute gap, then you're free at what, 2:30?"

"Badminton tournament starts at 6. I need to be arena by 5 to warm up."

"So 2:30 to 5. Two and a half hours." He said it like he was calculating something precious. "And then I have to be at bus station by 6:30 for the 7 PM bus back."

"That's it? That's all the time we get?"

"That's all the time I could manage." Ethan touched her face. "But it's more than we've had in six weeks. I'll take it."

Sophia's phone buzzed: Maya texting. *Dr. Reeves asking where you are. Told him bathroom emergency. Get back soon.*

"I have to go," Sophia said reluctantly.

"I know." Ethan stood, pulled her up with him. "Where should I meet you after your event?"

"There's an arena upstairs. Badminton tournament. I'll find you there around 2:30?"

"I'll be there." He pulled her close one more time, kissed the top of her head. "Good luck with Circuit Lab."

"Good luck not getting spotted."

"I've gotten pretty good at being invisible."

They left the equipment room separately—her first, then him after a thirty-second delay. She walked back to the basement conference rooms with her heart racing and her lips still tingling from kissing him. Real. He was real and here and they had two more hours this afternoon.

She could make it through one more competition.

---

Circuit Lab went even better than Trajectory.

Sophia was partnered with a senior named Lisa Chen (apparently Churchill High had a lot of Chens who weren't related). They had to build a functioning circuit to specifications, then troubleshoot deliberately introduced problems. Sophia's hands were steady, her mind clear. She understood electricity flow, resistance calculations, parallel versus series configurations. She and Lisa worked with efficient precision.

"Time!" the judge called. "Churchill High—perfect score. Well done."

More applause. Dr. Reeves was beaming. Maya gave her a thumbs up from across the room. And somewhere in the building, Ethan was waiting.

At 2:15 PM, Science Olympiad events concluded. They'd medaled in three categories—excellent showing for their first major competition. Dr. Reeves was collecting results, organizing the team for van loading at 4 PM for those not staying for other events.

"Sophia's staying," Maya announced. "Badminton tournament tonight, remember?"

"Right, right." Dr. Reeves checked his clipboard. "Your parents arranged your own ride back tomorrow?"

"Yes, sir. After tournament concludes Sunday morning."

"Okay. Be safe. Compete well. Make us proud."

"Will do."

The team packed up, headed out. Maya lingered until Dr. Reeves was occupied with loading vans, then grabbed Sophia's arm.

"Go. You have from now until 5 PM. I'm heading to hotel to nap, but my phone is on if you need emergency extraction."

"Thank you. For everything."

"Thank your boyfriend for driving eight hours. That's commitment." Maya hugged her. "Be smart. Be happy. I'll see you at tournament later."

She left. And Sophia was free.

She took the stairs to the main level, then the escalator to the upper arena where badminton was being set up. The space was enormous—twenty courts laid out on the arena floor, stands surrounding them, the particular echo of high-ceilinged athletic facilities. Tournament organizers were setting up nets and line marking. A few early competitors were already warming up.

And standing by the entrance to the stands, looking at his phone: Ethan.

Sophia's feet were moving before she consciously decided. She crossed the arena floor, climbed into the stands, sat next to him.

"Hi."

He looked up, and his smile was so bright it made her chest hurt. "Hi. How'd it go?"

"Perfect score."

"Of course you did." He pocketed his phone. "So we have two and a half hours. What do you want to do?"

"Honestly? Just talk. Just be together without having to hide in equipment rooms."

"Little bit hard in a public arena."

"True." Sophia thought. "There's a skyway system in Minneapolis. Connected buildings, coffee shops. We could walk?"

"Lead the way."

They left the convention center, entered the skyway system—the enclosed pedestrian bridges connecting downtown Minneapolis buildings. It was a maze of glass and concrete, climate-controlled and mostly empty on Saturday afternoon. They walked side by side, close enough that their hands occasionally brushed, far enough apart that they looked like friends to any observer.

They talked about everything and nothing. Ethan described the physics of hockey—angles and momentum and friction coefficients—and how understanding the math actually made him better at the game. Sophia told him about badminton nationals coming up in March, about Coach Kim's quiet support, about the way hitting a perfect smash felt like solving an equation.

They talked about college applications. About how Sophia was applying to schools in the Midwest and East Coast—Minnesota, Michigan, Chicago, Boston. About how Ethan was expected to apply to schools with strong hockey programs, but what he really wanted was somewhere with good physics and engineering programs that also happened to have hockey.

"Maybe we'll end up near each other," Sophia said. "By accident."

"I don't believe in accidents anymore. I believe in choices." Ethan stopped walking, turned to face her. "I'm choosing schools where you might be. I'm choosing a major I actually care about instead of what my dad wants. I'm choosing to figure out who I am instead of who everyone thinks I should be."

"What if your dad cuts you off? College tuition, support, all of it?"

"Then I'll figure it out. Scholarships, loans, work. People do it." He said it with a certainty that made her believe him. "I'm not staying under his control forever. Eighteen months until I'm eighteen. Then I'm legally an adult and he can't do this anymore."

Eighteen months. A year and a half of distance and letters and stolen moments. It sounded impossible and survivable in equal measure.

They found a coffee shop, bought drinks they didn't really want just to have somewhere to sit. Tucked into a corner table, they kept talking. Ethan pulled out his phone—not the confiscated one, but a new burner he'd bought—and showed her photos from Michigan. The prep school campus, cold and institutional. His dorm room, sterile and small. The hockey rink where he practiced twice a day.

Sophia showed him photos from her life: badminton competitions, Science Olympiad practices, selfies with Maya making ridiculous faces. Normal teenage life, except for the boyfriend-shaped absence in all of it.

"I miss you in every photo," she said quietly.

"Same. Everything I do, I'm thinking about what I'd tell you about it later. Like you're the audience I'm performing for, except I want you to be in the show with me, not watching from distance."

"Worst theater metaphor ever."

"Hey, I'm hockey player, not English major."

"You're actually good at English when you try."

"Only because you make me read books with you."

"Made you read books. Past tense."

"Make. Present tense. I'm still reading books you recommend. It's not the same when I can't discuss them with you, but I do it anyway." He reached across the table, took her hand. "Everything I do is still with you. Even when you're not there."

They sat like that, hands linked across coffee shop table, talking until they ran out of words and just looked at each other. Memorizing. Storing up against the coming absence.

At 4:45 PM, Sophia's phone alarm went off: time to head to arena.

"I have to warm up," she said reluctantly.

"I know. Can I watch?"

"You want to watch me warm up? That's the boring part."

"All parts are interesting parts when I haven't seen you in six weeks."

They walked back to the convention center, to the arena. Sophia changed into her competition gear in the locker room—red and white uniform, her lucky shoes, hair braided tight. When she emerged, Ethan was in the stands, three rows back from the court where she'd been assigned for warm-ups.

She tried to focus on her stretching, her practice shots, her footwork drills. But knowing he was watching made everything sharper. She moved with extra precision, hit shots with extra power. Showing off maybe, but not in a bad way. Showing him who she was on the court—strong, fast, confident. The version of herself that knew exactly what she was capable of.

At 5:45, Coach Kim appeared. She glanced at the stands, saw Ethan, and her expression flickered with something knowing before settling back to professional.

"Chen. Your first match is at 6:15. Court 4. You ready?"

"Yes, Coach."

"Good. Focus up. Play smart. Use that energy." Her eyes flicked to the stands again. "But don't let it make you reckless."

"I won't."

Coach Kim nodded and moved on to other players. Sophia glanced back at Ethan. He raised his hand in a small wave. She smiled.

She was going to win this tournament. Not for the medal or the ranking points.

For him. For them. For proof that she could be excellent even in the middle of impossible circumstances.

---

Sophia won her first match 21-9, 21-7.

The opponent was good but not great. Sophia read her patterns quickly, exploited weaknesses, played with aggressive confidence. Between sets, she glanced at the stands. Ethan was watching with the intensity of someone studying, not just spectating.

Second match, quarterfinals: tougher opponent from Minnesota. First set was close: 21-18. Second set, Sophia found her rhythm. She played smarter, not harder. Placed shots instead of just smashing. Won 21-12.

Semifinals at 7:30. The tournament was running late—too many matches, not enough courts. Sophia was supposed to play at 7:00, but her match got pushed to 7:30, then 7:45.

At 7:00, Ethan came down from the stands, found her in the staging area.

"I'm going to miss the match," he said quietly.

Sophia's heart sank. "Your bus—"

"Leaves at 7:15. I should already be gone. But I wanted to say goodbye first."

They moved to the edge of the staging area, as private as they could get in a room full of athletes and coaches. Sophia felt tears threatening.

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. I don't want to go either. But if I miss this bus, there isn't another until morning, and if I'm not back at school by 10 AM tomorrow, they'll report me missing." Ethan took both her hands. "I have to go."

"I know."

"But I watched you play. I saw you win. I got to spend today with you, talking and being real with each other. That's more than I had yesterday."

"Still not enough."

"No. But it's what we have." He pulled her close, kissed her forehead, then her cheek, then her lips. Soft and careful because they were in public, but intense enough that she felt it down to her toes. "Win this tournament. Play the way you played earlier—fierce and smart and unstoppable. And when you win, you'll know I was here. That I saw you. That I'm always watching even when I'm not there."

"How will I know?"

"Because I'll tell you. In letters, in codes, in whatever ways we figure out. I'll always tell you." One more kiss. "I love you."

"Love you too. Be safe. Text Jordan when you're back."

"I will." He stepped back, still holding her hand, then let go. "Win this, Sophia."

He left. She watched him walk away, watched him disappear into the crowd, felt the loss like a physical thing.

Then she turned back to the court. Her semifinal opponent was warming up already. Sophia had ten minutes before match start.

She used them to focus. To channel the ache of missing him into competitive fire. To remember Coach Kim's words: *use that energy, don't let it make you reckless.*

She could do this.

---

The semifinal match was brutal.

Her opponent was Wisconsin champion—tall, fast, powerful. First set went to 22-20 before Sophia took it. Second set, the Wisconsin player adjusted. Got more aggressive at net, varied her serves, pushed Sophia around the court.

At 15-12, Sophia glanced at the stands. He wasn't there anymore. Just Maya, Coach Kim, random spectators.

But he'd been there. He'd watched her. That mattered.

She refocused. Read her opponent's patterns. Noticed the weight shift before cross-court shots, the shoulder telegraph before clears. Started anticipating. Started winning points through intelligence instead of just power.

At 18-18, crucial point. Long rally. Both of them scrambling, retrieving impossible shots. Sophia saw the pattern: cross-court, down the line, cross-court, down the line. On the next cross-court, she anticipated, moved early, intercepted at net.

Winner. 19-18.

Her serve. She took a breath, served deep, followed to net. Her opponent cleared. Sophia smashed from mid-court.

Ace. 20-18.

Championship point. Her serve again. She served short this time, forcing an awkward return. The shuttle came back high. Sophia positioned, jumped, smashed with everything she had.

The shuttle hit the line. Her opponent dove, missed by inches.

"Point, game, match. Chen wins 22-20, 21-18. She advances to finals tomorrow morning."

Sophia stood at net, breathing hard, shaking slightly from adrenaline. She'd done it. Made finals playing the best badminton of her life, with him watching for half of it and in her heart for the rest.

Coach Kim was nodding approval. Maya was cheering from the stands. Sophia bowed to her opponent, shook hands, walked off court.

Finals tomorrow at 10 AM. Then the drive home. Back to reality, to distance, to coded messages and letters.

But tonight, she'd seen him. Today, they'd been together. For a few hours, they'd been real to each other instead of just words on pages or voices on phones.

It was enough.

It had to be enough.

---

Sophia was packing up her gear at 8:30 PM when Maya appeared, face pale.

"We have a problem."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "What kind of problem?"

Maya held out her phone. Instagram was open, showing a photo that made Sophia's blood run cold.

It was her and Ethan. In the hallway by the vending machines this morning. His face partially visible under the baseball cap, her face clear. They were standing close, talking, body language obviously intimate.

Posted by someone Sophia didn't recognize. Tagged with both their names. Caption: "Guess who's together at Minneapolis competitions? Thought they weren't allowed to see each other? 👀"

Posted forty-five minutes ago. Already 127 likes. Thirty-eight comments.

"Oh God," Sophia breathed.

"It gets worse." Maya swiped to messages. "People are sharing it. Someone sent it to Tyler Huang. He posted on his story with caption 'Price is gonna be pissed.' Your regular phone probably has notifications."

Sophia pulled out her phone. Seventeen Instagram notifications. Nine text messages. Three missed calls from unknown numbers.

She opened Instagram. The comments were brutal:

*"They really can't stay away from each other lol"*

*"Isn't there like a restraining order or something?"*

*"His dad is going to FREAK"*

*"This is so messy but also kind of romantic?"*

*"She's so dumb. Like, you're literally risking legal action for a boy"*

And then, worst of all, a comment from an account she didn't recognize: *"Sent this to Price's office. Let's see what happens now."*

"Maya—"

"I know. I'm trying to get it taken down, but people have already screenshotted." Maya's voice was tight with stress. "Jordan's been texting. Ethan's regular phone is blowing up. His dad called five times while he was on the bus."

Sophia felt like she was going to be sick. "Is Ethan okay?"

"Jordan says bus is still en route. Ethan's not answering messages. But Sophia—" Maya's expression was grim. "Jordan got a call from Robert Price. He knows Ethan was here. He knows you were together. And he's on his way."

"What do you mean on his way?"

"He was in Chicago for business. Saw the photo, called airlines. Jordan's friend whose mom works at airport checked—Robert Price booked flight to Minneapolis. Lands at 9:30."

Sophia checked her watch: 8:35. "That's less than an hour."

"Yeah."

"What do I do?"

"I don't know. Hide? Leave? Pray he doesn't find you?" Maya grabbed Sophia's arm. "He can't actually do anything, right? You're at a legitimate tournament. You have every right to be here."

"But I don't have the right to see Ethan. The cease and desist letter—"

"Didn't forbid you from being in the same building at separate events. You didn't violate anything legally binding." But Maya's voice was uncertain.

Sophia's regular phone rang. Unknown number. Minneapolis area code.

She answered. "Hello?"

"Sophia Chen?" Male voice, professional, cold.

"Yes?"

"This is Daniel Whitmore, attorney for Robert Price. I'm calling to inform you that Mr. Price has evidence you violated the cease and desist agreement. He's currently en route to Minneapolis and has instructed me to notify you that legal action will proceed unless you make yourself available for a meeting tonight."

"I didn't violate anything. I was at Science Olympiad competition. He was—" Sophia stopped. Saying Ethan was there was admission.

"Ms. Chen, we have photographic evidence of you and Ethan Price in close proximity and clearly engaged in intimate conversation. This constitutes contact, which violates the terms we outlined."

"Those terms weren't legally binding—"

"They will be when Mr. Price files for a restraining order Monday morning. Which he will do unless you cooperate tonight." The lawyer's voice was flat, factual. "Mr. Price will arrive at the convention center at approximately 10 PM. He expects to meet with you to discuss resolution. If you refuse, he will contact local authorities regarding parental notification and possible curfew violations."

"I'm seventeen. I have permission to be here—"

"Do your parents know you met with Ethan Price today?"

Sophia's silence was answer enough.

"Mr. Price will be at the convention center main entrance at 10 PM. I strongly suggest you be there." The lawyer hung up.

Sophia stood frozen, phone still pressed to her ear.

"What did they say?" Maya asked.

"Robert Price wants to meet me at 10 PM. If I don't show, he's calling police, my parents, everyone." Sophia's voice was shaking. "Maya, what do I do?"

"We run. We get in my car and we drive back to Winnipeg right now—"

"I have finals tomorrow at 10 AM. If I forfeit, Coach Kim will know something's wrong. And I can't just hide forever. He'll find me eventually."

"So what, you just meet him? Let him intimidate you?"

Sophia thought frantically. It was 8:40. Robert Price would arrive at 9:30, wanted to meet at 10:00. Ethan was on a bus somewhere between Minneapolis and Michigan, unreachable. Her parents were in Winnipeg, unaware. Coach Kim was probably at team dinner.

She was alone.

Except she wasn't. Maya was here. Jordan was a phone call away. And she had exactly one hour and twenty minutes to figure out what to do.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Jordan: *Ethan just messaged. His dad tracked his phone location to Minneapolis. He knows everything. Ethan's getting pulled off bus when it arrives at next stop. His dad arranged for pickup. He's going to be intercepted in about 2 hours.*

Another text: *Also, Price is landing Minneapolis. Are you safe?*

Sophia texted back: *Price wants to meet me at 10 PM. What do I do?*

Jordan's response was immediate: *Don't meet him alone. Get adult. Get witness. Don't let him corner you.*

"I need Coach Kim," Sophia said suddenly.

"What?"

"Jordan's right. I can't meet Price alone. But if I have Coach, if there's a witness who's an adult and can verify I was at legitimate competition..." Sophia was already moving, grabbing her bag. "Come on."

They found Coach Kim at the hotel restaurant where the badminton team was having dinner. Sophia pulled her aside, gave her the abbreviated version: photo posted online, Robert Price en route, lawyer calling with threats.

Coach Kim's expression went from surprised to angry to calculating in about ten seconds.

"He wants to meet you at 10 PM."

"Yes, Coach."

"And you're afraid he'll try to intimidate you into ending the relationship."

"Yes."

"Okay." Coach Kim pulled out her phone. "First, I'm calling your parents. They need to know what's happening. Second, you're not meeting him alone. I'll be there. Third—" she looked at Sophia with unusual gentleness "—you need to decide what you're willing to compromise on. Because if Robert Price is flying here tonight, he's not coming to have a reasonable conversation. He's coming to force compliance."

"I won't end it," Sophia said immediately. "I won't stop talking to Ethan."

"Then you need to be prepared for him to follow through on his threats. Legal action, college interference, all of it."

"I know."

"And you're still choosing this?"

"Yes."

Coach Kim nodded slowly. "Okay then. Let's go deal with an angry billionaire."

At 9:50 PM, Sophia stood in the convention center lobby with Coach Kim on one side and Maya on the other. Maya had refused to stay behind, had insisted on being there as moral support. Coach Kim had allowed it on the condition that Maya stay quiet and let Coach handle the talking.

Sophia's parents were on speakerphone in Coach Kim's pocket—her father's voice tight with fury, her mother's with worry. They'd wanted to drive down immediately, but it would take eight hours. Instead, they were on the line, listening, ready to intervene if needed.

At 9:55, a black car pulled up outside.

Robert Price got out.

He looked exactly like his son—tall, dark-haired, intense. But where Ethan's intensity was curiosity and passion, Robert's was control and calculation. He wore an expensive suit, no tie, moved with the confidence of someone who expected the world to bend to his will.

He saw Sophia through the glass doors. Walked in.

"Ms. Chen." His voice was cold. "Thank you for meeting me."

"Mr. Price." Sophia kept her voice steady.

"And you are?" Robert's eyes moved to Coach Kim.

"Kim Young-mi. Ms. Chen's badminton coach. I'm here to ensure this meeting remains appropriate."

"This is a private matter—"

"Ms. Chen is a minor. Any meeting regarding her conduct requires adult supervision. I'm providing that." Coach Kim's voice was steel wrapped in politeness. "You can speak with both of us or with neither. Your choice."

Robert's jaw tightened. Then he gestured to the seating area. "Fine. Let's sit."

They sat—Sophia and Coach Kim on one side, Robert Price on the other. Maya hovered near the windows, trying to be invisible but present. In Coach Kim's pocket, Sophia knew her parents were listening to every word.

"I'm going to be direct," Robert said. "You were told to cease contact with my son. You were given clear terms. Today you violated those terms. I have photographic evidence." He pulled out his phone, showed the Instagram photo. "This is you and Ethan, clearly together, clearly violating our agreement."

"There was no agreement," Sophia said, proud of how steady her voice sounded. "There was a threat. And I was here for Science Olympiad competition. If Ethan was also here, that's coincidence—"

"Don't insult my intelligence." Robert's voice was sharp. "He told his school he had a family emergency. There was no emergency. He lied to school administration to come here to see you. That's calculated deception, which you enabled."

"I didn't enable anything. I didn't ask him to come—"

"But you knew he was coming. You met him. You spent time with him." Robert leaned forward. "Ms. Chen, I'm trying to protect my son's future. He has potential—athletic, academic, professional. But he's seventeen and making decisions based on emotions rather than logic. Someone has to protect him from himself. That's my job as his father."

"Protecting him would be supporting what makes him happy," Sophia shot back. "Not controlling every aspect of his life."

"I'm not going to debate parenting philosophy with a seventeen-year-old." Robert's tone was dismissive. "Here's what's happening. Monday morning, I'm filing for a restraining order. Formal, legal, enforceable. It will require you to stay at least 500 feet from Ethan at all times. Violation will result in criminal charges."

"You can't—"

"I can. I have evidence of pattern of behavior designed to interfere with his development. I have lawyers who will make that case convincingly." Robert's expression was hard. "I'm also contacting every school on your college application list. I'll be providing them with character assessment that suggests you have difficulty respecting boundaries and authority. That you pursue relationships in manipulative ways. That you're a liability risk."

"That's slander—"

"It's protected opinion. I'll phrase it carefully. But Ms. Chen—" Robert's voice dropped "—I will destroy your college prospects if you don't end this now. Your choice."

Sophia felt like she couldn't breathe. Maya made a small, furious noise. Coach Kim's hand on Sophia's arm was the only thing keeping her from falling apart.

Then she heard her father's voice, tinny but clear from Coach Kim's pocket: "Put me on speaker."

Coach Kim pulled out her phone, clicked speaker. "Go ahead, Mr. Chen."

"Robert Price, this is Michael Chen, Sophia's father. I'm an attorney in Winnipeg, and I've been listening to this entire conversation." Her dad's voice was ice-cold professional. "What you're doing right now constitutes harassment of a minor. Your threats regarding college prospects qualify as defamation with intent to harm. And if you follow through on any of these threats, I will personally ensure you face legal consequences."

Robert's expression flickered. "Mr. Chen—"

"I'm not finished. My daughter has done nothing illegal. She attended academic and athletic competitions she was registered for months in advance. If your son chose to be at the same location, that's his choice, not hers. You have no legal grounds for a restraining order, and any judge will see this for what it is: a powerful man trying to control his son by intimidating a teenage girl."

"Your daughter is interfering—"

"Your son is making his own choices. That's not interference. That's agency." Michael's voice was sharp. "Now, here's what's going to happen. You're going to leave my daughter alone. You're going to withdraw any threats regarding her education. And you're going to stop using legal system as a weapon against teenagers."

"Or what?"

"Or I make this public. Every threat, every intimidation tactic, every abuse of power. I'll make sure every newspaper in Minnesota knows that Robert Price, wealthy businessman, spent his Saturday night threatening a teenage girl because his son fell in love with someone he didn't approve of. How do you think that plays for your reputation?"

Silence.

Robert Price looked at Sophia with something like hatred mixed with grudging respect. Then he stood.

"This isn't over."

"Yeah, it is." Sophia stood too, finding her voice. "Because I'm not afraid of you anymore. You can threaten me. You can try to ruin my life. But you can't stop me from loving your son. And you can't stop him from loving me. So do your worst. We'll survive it."

Robert stared at her. Then, without another word, he walked out.

The black car pulled away.

Sophia stood shaking in the lobby, watching him leave. Maya rushed over, hugged her fiercely. Coach Kim was already talking to her parents, reassuring them.

Sophia's phone buzzed. Text from Jordan: *Ethan was pulled off bus. His dad's security is driving him back to prep school. He's okay but phone is confiscated. He wanted me to tell you: worth it. Every consequence. He'd do it again.*

Another text: *Also, someone took video of Price leaving convention center looking pissed. It's already on TikTok. Caption: "When you fly to another state to yell at your son's girlfriend but her dad is lawyer." You guys are viral again.*

Sophia laughed—slightly hysterical but real. They'd survived. Robert Price had tried to break them and failed.

But as she sat down, legs suddenly weak, she realized something: this was far from over.

The photo was out. Evidence was public. And Robert Price wasn't the type to accept defeat.

Monday morning, something was going to happen. She could feel it.

She pulled out her regular phone, opened her parents' messages: *We love you. We're proud of you. Come home tomorrow after tournament. We'll figure out next steps together.*

Then Instagram: one new notification.

She opened it.

Someone had created a Reddit thread: "Rich hockey dad vs teenage girl: comprehensive timeline." It detailed everything—Ethan being sent to Michigan, the cease and desist letter, tonight's confrontation. Someone had even found courthouse records of Robert Price's lawyers filing preliminary restraining order paperwork yesterday.

Comments were mixed. Some sympathetic to her. Some saying she was asking for trouble. Some analyzing the legal implications.

And at the bottom, newest comment, posted three minutes ago:

*"Plot twist: Robert Price just landed back in Chicago. Source: friend who works at private terminal. He's making more calls. This isn't over by a long shot."*

Sophia closed the app, looked at Coach Kim.

"What do I do?"

"You compete tomorrow. You win. You go home. You let your parents handle the legal stuff. And you keep living your life." Coach Kim's voice was firm. "He can't win if you refuse to be broken."

"What if he follows through on the college threats?"

"Then you fight. Or you go to schools he can't touch. Or you prove you're excellent despite his interference." Coach Kim met her eyes. "You're stronger than you think, Chen. Don't let him make you forget that."

Sophia won the tournament the next morning.

She played the finals match with surgical precision, channeling every ounce of stress and fear and defiance into perfect badminton. Won 21-14, 21-11. Stood on the podium receiving her gold medal and thought about Ethan watching yesterday, thought about Robert Price trying to break her, thought about her parents listening on the phone and Coach Kim standing beside her and Maya refusing to leave.

She thought about love being worth fighting for, even when the fight was hard.

After the tournament, Maya drove her back to Winnipeg. Eight hours in the car, processing everything. They stopped for food in Fargo, sat in a Denny's booth eating mediocre pancakes and trying to figure out what came next.

"Do you think he'll actually file for the restraining order?" Maya asked.

"I don't know. My dad seems to think he won't—too much bad publicity. But Price doesn't strike me as someone who backs down easily."

"Yeah, he strikes me as someone who escalates." Maya poked at her pancakes. "Be honest. Are you scared?"

"Terrified. But also..." Sophia considered. "Also kind of done with being scared? Like, he's tried to control this with money and lawyers and intimidation. And we're still here. Still fighting. At some point, fear stops being useful."

"That's very brave or very stupid."

"Maybe both."

They drove the rest of the way listening to music and not talking, because there wasn't much left to say. They arrived in Winnipeg at 6 PM. Maya dropped her off with a fierce hug and a promise to text later.

Sophia walked into her house.

Her parents were waiting in the living room. Her dad looked tired but determined. Her mom looked worried but proud. Tommy was upstairs, probably listening from the landing.

"Sit," her dad said. "We need to talk about what comes next."

Sophia sat.

"First," her mother said, "are you okay? Really okay?"

"I don't know. Ask me in a week."

"Fair." Her dad pulled out a folder. "I've been researching. Price's threats regarding college applications are mostly bluff. He can't legally interfere with admissions in any way that we couldn't counteract with our own letters. The restraining order is more complicated—he could file, but getting it approved would require proving actual harassment, which he can't do."

"So I'm safe?"

"Legally? Mostly. Practically?" Her dad's expression was grim. "Robert Price has resources and connections we don't. He could still make your life difficult in ways that aren't technically illegal. We need to be prepared for that."

"What do you suggest?"

"Apply to more schools than you planned. Diversify options. Have backups to your backups. And document everything—every contact, every threat, every interaction. Build a case for harassment if we need it."

"And Ethan?"

Her parents exchanged a look.

"What you and Ethan do is your choice," her mother said carefully. "We can't stop you. We can't control you. But we can't protect you from every consequence either. You're old enough to make your own decisions about relationships. You're also old enough to handle what comes with those decisions."

"So you're okay with us staying together?"

"We're okay with you being the person who fights for what matters to you," her father said. "Even when it's hard. Even when powerful people try to stop you. That's who we raised you to be."

Sophia felt tears threatening. "Thank you."

"Just be smart. Be careful. And know that we're here." Her mom hugged her. "Always."

That night, Sophia lay in bed checking her phone compulsively. No texts from Jordan. No updates on Ethan.

At 11:47, her phone buzzed.

Unknown number. She answered.

"Sophia?" Ethan's voice, whispered, urgent.

"Oh my God, you're okay—"

"Can't talk long. New phone, borrowed from physics teacher. He's helping me. Long story." Ethan's words tumbled out fast. "Are you okay? Jordan told me what happened with my dad—"

"I'm okay. Your dad is terrifying, but I'm okay. Are you okay?"

"Suspended for two weeks. Loss of all privileges. Extra practice sessions as 'consequence for lying.' But Soph—" his voice intensified "—I'd do it again. Every second with you was worth every minute of this."

"They can't keep doing this to us—"

"They can't keep us apart. That's what matters." His voice dropped even lower. "Listen. I'm going to be under stricter surveillance now. Might not be able to call as often. Might not be able to write as much. But I'm not giving up. I'm not giving in. You understand?"

"I understand. Me neither."

"One and a half more years. Then we're legal adults. Then they can't control us anymore."

"Eighteen months."

"We can make it eighteen months."

"Yeah. We can."

Silence—charged, electric, full of everything they couldn't say and didn't need to.

"I have to go," Ethan said regretfully. "Teacher is waiting for phone back. But Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for yesterday. For being there. For being you. For choosing me even when it's hard."

"Always. Every time. You."

The call ended.

Sophia lay in the dark, holding the phone, thinking about eighteen months and impossible odds and the way love felt like both the hardest and easiest choice she'd ever made.

Her phone buzzed again. Text from number she didn't recognize:

She almost didn't open it. But curiosity won.

The message made her blood run cold:

*"Enjoy your victory, Ms. Chen. But understand: I protect what's mine. And my son's future is mine to protect. This is far from over. —RP"*

Then, before she could respond, another text from a different number—Jordan:

*Emergency. Ethan's in trouble. His dad found the borrowed phone. Security confiscated it, caught the call. They're threatening to press charges against the teacher for facilitating unauthorized contact. Ethan's being transferred. Different school. Even more remote. Effective immediately.*

And a final text, this one from Maya, with a screenshot:

Someone had posted new photo to Instagram. Sophia and Ethan, yesterday, in the equipment room. The door partially open, clearly kissing. Tagged with both their names, plus Robert Price's business account.

Posted two minutes ago by anonymous account.

Caption: "Evidence for restraining order hearing Monday 9 AM. Violation of parental consent and clear disregard for boundaries. #Consequences"

Sophia sat up, heart racing.

Monday morning. Restraining order hearing. Nine AM.

Her phone rang: Dad calling.

"I saw the post," he said without preamble. "I'm getting on a plane to Minneapolis first thing tomorrow. We're fighting this."

"Dad—"

"You're not alone in this, Sophia. We're fighting. All of us."

The call ended.

Sophia looked at her phone—at the messages, the threats, the evidence being weaponized against them.

Outside her window, Winnipeg winter pressed against the glass. February cold, brutal and unforgiving.

But inside, she felt something that wasn't cold at all.

She felt ready to fight.

Whatever came next—restraining orders, legal battles, school transfers, surveillance—they'd face it.

Because some things were worth fighting for.

Some people were worth eighteen impossible months.

And love was worth every consequence.
