# CHAPTER 4: VALENTINE'S REUNION

The Minneapolis Convention Center smelled like industrial coffee and floor polish. Chaos with a soundtrack—rolling equipment cases on concrete, hundreds of competing conversations echoing off glass walls, someone's phone alarm going off in a backpack somewhere.

Three simultaneous competitions occupied different floors: Science Olympiad in the basement conference rooms, robotics tournament on the main floor, badminton in the arena upstairs. Hundreds of students, coaches, and parents flowing through hallways with the organized confusion of academic competition day.

Sophia's team came through the main entrance at 8:45, equipment bags and nervous energy making them louder than usual. Dr. Reeves checked them in, collected schedules, organized their scattered focus into something resembling readiness.

"Trajectory competition starts at 10:30," he told Sophia and Marcus. "You have your event at 11 AM in Room B-7. Circuit Lab at 1:15 PM. Stay hydrated, stay focused, and remember—this is supposed to be fun."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Fun."

"Fun-adjacent," Dr. Reeves amended with a grin. "Go set up. You have forty-five minutes."

The basement conference rooms: fluorescent-lit, windowless, filled with folding tables and that particular smell school buildings have everywhere—old textbooks, chemical cleaning products, teenage anxiety. Teams clustered by school, setting up equipment, running final tests. Sophia and Marcus found their assigned table, began unpacking their catapult.

Sophia's hands were steady assembling the base, attaching the elastic, calibrating the release mechanism. This was familiar. This she could control. The physics of trajectory, the mathematics of projectile motion, the precision of engineering—solid and knowable.

Unlike everything else right now.

"Okay, so air resistance coefficient," Marcus said, pulling out their calculator. "Temperature's probably 21 Celsius, humidity feels low..."

They worked together, falling into the rhythm they'd built during practice. Test launches. Measurements. Tiny adjustments. Their catapult was performing—consistent velocity, predictable arc. They'd do well today.

Sophia was calculating the third test angle when she felt it.

That shift in the air. Like the temperature dropped two degrees or the room got quieter except it didn't. Some part of her brain—the part that had been tuned to his frequency since October—registered his presence before she consciously processed it.

She looked up.

Ethan Price stood in the doorway.

Time did that thing. Everything else went soft-focus. He was there. Solid and real. Jeans, dark blue hoodie, baseball cap pulled low. Scanning the room, methodical. When his eyes found her they stopped.

He took a breath. His expression shifted from tense to—relief, longing, something she felt in her chest. He didn't smile—too many people, too risky—but his eyes said everything.

*Hi. I'm here. I made it. You're real.*

Thirty feet of conference room between them and she couldn't breathe. The distance of six weeks collapsed into nothing.

"Sophia?" Marcus's voice. "You good?"

"Yeah." She forced herself back to the catapult. Her hands were shaking. "Yeah, sorry. Thought I—"

"So this launch angle, I think we should—"

But she wasn't listening anymore. Her entire awareness tracked him moving along the back wall, staying out of the main traffic, finding a position where he could watch without drawing attention. Visitor pass clipped to his hoodie—probably said he was there to observe, thinking about joining Science Olympiad next year, something plausible and boring.

He'd thought this through. Planned.

And he was here.

"Five minutes to competition start!" A judge's voice boomed.

Sophia focused. She had a competition to win. Then time. Three hours, if his letter was accurate. Three hours in the same city, same building.

She could last through one physics competition.

---

Trajectory went perfectly.

She and Marcus synchronized, efficient, confident. Measured the target distance in seconds, calculated optimal trajectory, adjusted their catapult with practiced precision. First launch: 8.2 centimeters from center. Second launch: 3.1 centimeters. Third launch: dead center.

"Churchill High scores 27 points!" The judge's voice echoed. "Current tournament leader!"

Marcus high-fived her, grinning. Other teams applauded politely, some with jealous side-eyes. The satisfaction of competence washed through her—problems solved correctly, targets hit under pressure. This was who she was.

She glanced at the back wall. Ethan. Still there. Leaning with apparent casualness, hands shoved deep in his pockets. But tension in his shoulders, in the set of his jaw. He'd watched the whole thing.

"Circuit Lab's in an hour," Marcus said, packing up their catapult. "Want to grab food?"

"You go. I need to—" Sophia scrambled for excuse. "Bathroom. Then I'll meet you."

"Cool. Text if you can't find it."

Marcus headed out with the other team members. Dr. Reeves was talking to judges, reviewing scores. Maya appeared at Sophia's elbow, having finished her Code Busters event.

"He's here," Maya whispered.

"I know."

"Back wall. Blue hoodie. Has been watching you like—"

"Maya—"

"Go. You have an hour before next event. I'll cover with Dr. Reeves." Maya squeezed her arm. "Go."

Sophia went.

She walked out of the conference room trying to look casual—bathroom, food court, anywhere that wasn't following the boy in the blue hoodie. Didn't look back to see if he was following. Just walked.

The hallway: crowded with students between events. Sophia navigated through them, heart pounding, heading toward the east stairwell that looked less trafficked. Climbed to the ground floor, kept walking, found an alcove near the vending machines. Relatively quiet.

She stopped. Waited. Counted her breaths.

Ten seconds. Twenty.

Footsteps behind her.

She turned.

Ethan stopped ten feet away. Neither of them moved. Just looked at each other—really looked, taking in every detail photos and memories couldn't quite capture. He looked tired. Shadows under his eyes, tension around his mouth. But solid, real, here.

"Hi."

She couldn't make her voice work right. "—hi."

"You were—" He stops, starts again. "That third shot. Perfect calculation."

"Math doesn't lie."

"No. It doesn't." A step closer. Then another. "Can I—is it safe to—"

"Not here." Sophia glanced around. Too many people. A door marked "Equipment Storage - Staff Only." Probably locked, but—

It wasn't. Small miracles.

They slipped inside. Sophia locked the door behind them. The room was small, filled with folding chairs and spare podiums and the forgotten debris of countless conventions. A single window high on one wall let in gray February light. And they were alone.

Completely, finally alone.

Ethan pulled off his baseball cap, ran a hand through his hair. "God, it's good to see you."

"How are you even—" Sophia's voice shook. "Eight hours on a bus, lying to prep school—"

"Had to. Couldn't do another week of letters and codes and missing you." He took a step toward her. "Had to know this is real. That you're—"

She closed the distance and kissed him.

His arms came around her instantly, pulling her against him like she might disappear if he didn't hold tight enough. She gripped his hoodie, kissed him with six weeks of longing and desperation. He was solid and here and hers.

When they finally broke apart, both breathing hard, she realized she was crying.

"Hey—" Ethan wiped her tears with his thumbs. "Hey, don't—"

"Can't help it. You're here. You actually—"

"Told you I would." He rested his forehead against hers. "Told you I'd find a way."

They stood like that. Just breathing together, hands tangled in fabric and hair, reassuring themselves through touch that this wasn't another dream or letter. This was real.

"Tell me everything," Sophia said finally.

They sat on the floor, backs against the wall, shoulders pressed together. Ethan talked in low, urgent tones. Prep school reality: the surveillance somehow worse than his letters made it sound. The roommate who'd been moved after reporting Ethan's burner phone call. The new roommate who was sullen but minded his own business. The hockey—excellent, exhausting. The academics—rigorous, soulless. The constant feeling of being watched.

"But the worst part is that it's working. The hockey program, I mean. I'm getting better. Faster, stronger, smarter about the game. Coaches think I could get Division I scholarship offers by senior year." His voice went flat. "So my dad's strategy is succeeding. Ship me away, force focus, eliminate distractions. All working exactly how he planned."

"Except for the part where you're miserable."

"Except for that." A smile without humor. "But he doesn't care about that part. Just results."

"Have you talked to him? Since you left?"

"Weekly check-in calls. Fifteen minutes. He asks about metrics—practice stats, academic grades, coach feedback." Ethan's jaw tightened. "Never asks how I'm doing. Never asks if I'm happy. It's like talking to a performance review algorithm."

Sophia took his hand, laced their fingers together. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. This is his choice, not yours. You didn't make him this way."

"But I'm the reason he's punishing you."

"No. His need for control is the reason. You're just the thing he can't control." Ethan lifted their joined hands, kissed her knuckles. "And I'm glad. I don't want him to control this. This is mine. Ours."

They sat in comfortable silence. Then Sophia told him her side—the cease and desist letter, her parents' careful support, Jordan's help, Maya's fierce loyalty. The breakdown in calculus class. Science Olympiad saving her. Coach Kim's knowing looks and Tyler's continued smug judgment.

"And Becca? Still not talking to you?"

"Still not. I think she's hurt. Like she thinks I chose you over our friendship." Sophia considered. "Which isn't true, but I understand why it feels that way to her."

"You miss her."

"Yeah. I do. But I'd make the same choice."

"That's what I told my dad. When he was sending me to Michigan. He said I was throwing away opportunities for a girl. I told him I wasn't throwing away anything—I was choosing what mattered." Ethan's voice was quiet but certain. "You matter more than his plans. More than hockey. More than any of it."

"Hockey matters to you though. You said yourself you're getting better—"

"I am. And I like it. Playing at this level, the challenge." He turned to face her fully. "But Soph—I don't want to be good at hockey just because it's what I'm supposed to want. I want to figure out what I actually want. And the only time I feel like myself, like I know who I am, is when I'm with you."

She kissed him again. Slower this time. Soft and careful and full of all the things she couldn't quite say. The musty smell of the storage room mixed with his soap—familiar, grounding. His hand cupped her face, thumb stroking her cheekbone with heartbreaking gentleness.

When they pulled apart, she checked her phone: 11:42 AM.

"I have Circuit Lab at 1:15."

"How long does that run?"

"Forty-five minutes, maybe an hour."

"So we have—" Ethan calculated. "Thirty-three minutes now, then ninety-minute gap, then you're free at 2:30?"

"Badminton tournament starts at 6. I need to be arena by 5."

"So 2:30 to 5. Two and a half hours." He said it like he was calculating treasure. "And then I have to be at bus station by 6:30 for the 7 PM bus back."

"That's it? That's all we get?"

"That's all I could manage." Ethan touched her face. "But it's more than we've had in six weeks. I'll take it."

Sophia's phone buzzed: Maya. *Dr. Reeves asking where you are. Told him bathroom emergency. Get back soon.*

"I have to go."

"I know." Ethan stood, pulled her up with him. "Where should I meet you after?"

"Arena upstairs. Badminton tournament. I'll find you around 2:30?"

"I'll be there." He pulled her close one more time, kissed the top of her head. His heart beat steady against her ear—real, alive, here. "Good luck with Circuit Lab."

"Good luck not getting spotted."

"I've gotten pretty good at being invisible."

They left the equipment room separately—her first, then him after a thirty-second delay. She walked back to the basement conference rooms with her heart racing and her lips still tingling. Real. He was real and here and they had two more hours this afternoon.

She could make it through one more competition.

---

Circuit Lab went even better than Trajectory.

Sophia partnered with a senior named Lisa Chen (apparently Churchill High had a lot of Chens who weren't related). They had to build a functioning circuit to specifications, then troubleshoot deliberately introduced problems. Sophia's hands: steady. Her mind: clear. She understood electricity flow, resistance calculations, parallel versus series configurations. She and Lisa worked with efficient precision.

"Time!" The judge called. "Churchill High—perfect score. Well done."

More applause. Dr. Reeves beaming. Maya giving her a thumbs up from across the room. And somewhere in the building, Ethan waiting.

At 2:15 PM, Science Olympiad events concluded. They'd medaled in three categories—excellent showing for their first major competition. Dr. Reeves collected results, organized the team for van loading at 4 PM for those not staying.

"Sophia's staying," Maya announced. "Badminton tournament tonight, remember?"

"Right, right." Dr. Reeves checked his clipboard. "Your parents arranged your own ride back tomorrow?"

"Yes, sir. After tournament concludes Sunday morning."

"Okay. Be safe. Compete well. Make us proud."

"Will do."

The team packed up, headed out. Maya lingered until Dr. Reeves was occupied with loading vans, then grabbed Sophia's arm.

"Go. You have from now until 5 PM. I'm heading to hotel to nap but my phone is on if you need emergency extraction."

"Thank you. For everything."

"Thank your boyfriend for driving eight hours. That's commitment." Maya hugged her. "Be smart. Be happy. I'll see you at tournament later."

She left. And Sophia was free.

She took the stairs to the main level, then the escalator to the upper arena. Badminton being set up. The space was enormous—twenty courts laid out on the arena floor, stands surrounding them, the echo of high-ceilinged athletic facilities. Tournament organizers setting up nets and line marking. A few early competitors already warming up.

And standing by the entrance to the stands, looking at his phone: Ethan.

Sophia's feet moved before she consciously decided. Crossed the arena floor, climbed into the stands, sat next to him.

"Hi."

He looked up. His smile was so bright it made her chest hurt. "Hi. How'd it go?"

"Perfect score."

"Of course you did." He pocketed his phone. "So we have two and a half hours. What do you want to do?"

"Honestly? Just talk. Just be together without having to hide in equipment rooms."

"Little bit hard in a public arena."

"True." Sophia thought. "There's a skyway system downtown. Connected buildings, coffee shops. We could walk?"

"Lead the way."

They left the convention center, entered the skyway system. Glass-walled corridors overlooked the streets below, connecting tower lobbies and office buildings in a climate-controlled maze. Outside, February cold pressed against the windows. Inside, warm air and the muffled sounds of a Saturday afternoon.

They walked side by side. Close enough that their hands occasionally brushed. Far enough apart that they looked like friends to any observer. They talked about everything and nothing. Ethan described the physics of hockey—angles and momentum and friction coefficients—and how understanding the math actually made him better. Sophia told him about badminton nationals coming up in March, about Coach Kim's quiet support, about the way hitting a perfect smash felt like solving an equation.

College applications. Sophia applying to schools in the Midwest and East Coast—Minnesota, Michigan, Chicago, Boston. Ethan expected to apply to schools with strong hockey programs, but what he really wanted was somewhere with good physics and engineering programs that also happened to have hockey.

"We could end up—like, what if we both got into schools in the same city? By accident?"

"I'm not leaving it to accident." He stopped walking, turned to face her. "I'm choosing schools where you might be. I'm choosing a major I actually care about instead of what my dad wants. I'm choosing to figure out who I am instead of who everyone thinks I should be."

"What if your dad cuts you off? College tuition, support—"

"Then I'll figure it out. Scholarships, loans, work. People do it." He said it with certainty that made her believe him. "I'm not staying under his control forever. Eighteen months until I'm eighteen. Then I'm legally an adult and he can't do this anymore."

Eighteen months. A year and a half of distance and letters and stolen moments. Impossible and survivable in equal measure.

They found a coffee shop, bought drinks they didn't really want just to have somewhere to sit. Tucked into a corner table, they kept talking. Ethan pulled out his phone—not the confiscated one, a new burner he'd bought—and showed her photos from Michigan. The prep school campus, cold and institutional. His dorm room, sterile and small. The hockey rink where he practiced twice a day.

Sophia showed him photos from her life: badminton competitions, Science Olympiad practices, selfies with Maya making ridiculous faces. Normal teenage life, except for the boyfriend-shaped absence in all of it.

"I miss you in every photo."

"Same. Everything I do, I'm thinking about what I'd tell you later. Like you're the audience I'm performing for except I want you in the show with me, not watching from distance."

"Worst theater metaphor ever."

"Hey, I'm hockey player, not English major."

"You're actually good at English when you try."

"Only because you make me read books with you."

"Made. Past tense."

"Make. Present tense. I'm still reading books you recommend. It's not the same when I can't discuss them with you but I do it anyway." He reached across the table, took her hand. "Everything I do is still with you. Even when you're not there."

They sat like that. Hands linked across coffee shop table. Talking until they ran out of words and just looked at each other. Memorizing. Storing up against the coming absence.

At 4:45 PM, Sophia's phone alarm: time to head to arena.

"I have to warm up."

"Can I watch?"

"You want to watch me warm up? That's the boring part."

"All parts are interesting when I haven't seen you in six weeks."

They walked back to the convention center, to the arena. Sophia changed into her competition gear in the locker room—red and white uniform, lucky shoes, hair braided tight. When she emerged, Ethan was in the stands, three rows back from the court where she'd been assigned for warm-ups.

She tried to focus on her stretching, practice shots, footwork drills. But knowing he was watching made everything sharper. She moved with extra precision, hit shots with extra power. Showing off maybe, but not in a bad way. Showing him who she was on the court—strong, fast, confident. The version of herself that knew exactly what she was capable of.

At 5:45, Coach Kim appeared. Glanced at the stands, saw Ethan. Her expression flickered with recognition before settling back to professional.

"Chen. Your first match is at 6:15. Court 4. You ready?"

"Yes, Coach."

"Good. Focus up. Play smart. Use that energy." Her eyes flicked to the stands again. "But don't let it make you reckless."

"I won't."

Coach Kim nodded and moved on. Sophia glanced back at Ethan. He raised his hand in a small wave.

She was going to win this tournament. Not for the medal or the ranking points.

For him. For them. For proof that she could be excellent even in the middle of impossible circumstances.

---

Sophia won her first match 21-9, 21-7.

The opponent: good but not great. Sophia read her patterns quickly, exploited weaknesses, played with aggressive confidence. Between sets, she glanced at the stands. Ethan watching with the intensity of someone studying, not just spectating.

Second match, quarterfinals: tougher opponent from Minnesota. First set was close: 21-18. Second set, Sophia found her rhythm. Played smarter, not harder. Placed shots instead of just smashing. Won 21-12.

Semifinals at 7:30. The tournament running late—too many matches, not enough courts. Sophia was supposed to play at 7:00, but her match got pushed to 7:30, then 7:45.

At 7:00, Ethan came down from the stands, found her in the staging area.

"I'm going to miss the match."

Sophia's heart sank. "Your bus—"

"Leaves at 7:15. I should already be gone. But I wanted to say goodbye first."

They moved to the edge of the staging area. As private as they could get in a room full of athletes and coaches. Tears threatening.

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. I don't want to go either. But if I miss this bus, there isn't another until morning, and if I'm not back at school by 10 AM tomorrow, they'll report me missing." Ethan took both her hands. "I have to go."

"I know."

"But I watched you play. I saw you win. I got to spend today with you, talking and being real with each other. That's more than I had yesterday."

"Still not enough."

"No. But it's what we have." He pulled her close, kissed her forehead, then her cheek, then her lips. Soft and careful because they were in public but intense enough that she felt it down to her toes. "Win this tournament. Play the way you played earlier—fierce and smart and unstoppable. And when you win, you'll know I was here. That I saw you. That I'm always watching even when I'm not there."

"How will I know?"

"Because I'll tell you. In letters, in codes, in whatever ways we figure out." One more kiss. "I love you."

"Love you too. Be safe. Text Jordan when you're back."

"I will." He stepped back, still holding her hand, then let go. "Win this, Sophia."

He left. She watched him walk away, watched him disappear into the crowd. The loss hit like a physical thing.

Then she turned back to the court. Her semifinal opponent warming up already. Ten minutes before match start.

She used them to focus. To channel the ache of missing him into competitive fire. Coach Kim's words: *use that energy, don't let it make you reckless.*

She could do this.

---

The semifinal match was brutal.

Her opponent: Wisconsin champion. Tall, fast, powerful. First set went to 22-20 before Sophia took it. Second set, the Wisconsin player adjusted. Got more aggressive at net, varied her serves, pushed Sophia around the court.

At 15-12, Sophia glanced at the stands. He wasn't there anymore. Just Maya, Coach Kim, random spectators.

But he'd been there. He'd watched her.

She refocused. Read her opponent's patterns. Noticed the weight shift before cross-court shots, the shoulder telegraph before clears. Started anticipating. Started winning points through intelligence instead of just power.

At 18-18, crucial point. Long rally. Both of them scrambling, retrieving impossible shots. Sophia saw the pattern: cross-court, down the line, cross-court, down the line. On the next cross-court, she anticipated, moved early, intercepted at net.

Winner. 19-18.

Her serve. She took a breath, served deep, followed to net. Her opponent cleared. Sophia smashed from mid-court.

Ace. 20-18.

Championship point. Her serve again. She served short this time, forcing an awkward return. The shuttle came back high. Sophia positioned, jumped, smashed with everything she had.

The shuttle hit the line. Her opponent dove, missed by inches.

"Point, game, match. Chen wins 22-20, 21-18. She advances to finals tomorrow morning."

Sophia stood at net. Breathing hard. Shaking slightly from adrenaline. She'd done it. Made finals playing the best badminton of her life, with him watching for half of it and in her heart for the rest.

Coach Kim nodding approval. Maya cheering from the stands. Sophia bowed to her opponent, shook hands, walked off court.

Finals tomorrow at 10 AM. Then the drive home. Back to reality, to distance, to coded messages and letters.

But today, she'd seen him. Today, they'd been together. For a few hours, they'd been real to each other instead of just words on pages.

It was enough.

It had to be.

---

Sophia was packing up her gear at 8:30 PM when Maya appeared. Face pale.

"We have a problem."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "What kind of—"

Maya held out her phone. Instagram open. A photo that made Sophia's blood run cold.

Her and Ethan. In the equipment room. The door partially open, clearly kissing. Posted by an anonymous account two minutes ago. Tagged with both their names, plus an account she didn't recognize: @RobertPriceEsq.

Caption: "Evidence collected 2/13/25, 3:47 PM"

Already 127 likes. Comments pouring in.

Sophia's phone rang. Dad.

She answered with shaking hands. "Dad?"

"Sophia." His voice was tight. "Robert Price's lawyer just emailed. Emergency restraining order hearing Monday 9 AM. They have photo evidence documenting time and location. This is happening."

"But we didn't—we just—"

"I know. But they have evidence of contact, which is what they needed." Her father's voice: controlled fury. "I'm getting on a plane first thing tomorrow morning. We're fighting this. But Sophia—this is real now. Monday morning, Minneapolis courthouse. His lawyers, us, a judge. Do you understand?"

She looked at Maya's phone. At the photo of her and Ethan kissing. Someone had followed them. Photographed them. Waited for the perfect moment to weaponize it.

"I understand."

"Win your tournament tomorrow. Then come home. We'll figure out the rest." He paused. "I love you. We're with you. Always."

The call ended.

Sophia stared at the phone. At the Instagram post. At the evidence that would be presented Monday morning.

Her phone buzzed. A text from a number she didn't recognize:

*See you in court, Ms. Chen. - RP*

The tournament announcer's voice echoed through the arena: "Chen advances to finals tomorrow."

But tomorrow didn't matter anymore.

Monday did.
