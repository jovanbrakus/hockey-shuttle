# CHAPTER 2: LEGAL

The doorbell rang on Sunday morning at 9:47 AM.

Sophia was still in her pajamas, eating cereal at the kitchen counter while her parents read the newspaper and Tommy played video games in the living room. Normal Sunday morning. Lazy. Safe.

The doorbell rang again. Insistent.

Her father looked up, frowning. "We expecting anyone?"

"No." Her mother said, already moving toward the door.

Sophia watched her mom check the peephole. Linda Chen's entire body went rigid. She turned back to face the kitchen, her expression carefully controlled in a way that made Sophia's stomach drop.

"Michael. It's Robert Price."

The newspaper crinkled in her father's hands. "What?"

"Robert Price. At our door. Alone."

Sophia's cereal turned to ash in her mouth. Ethan's father. Here. At their house.

Her dad stood, straightened his shirt—still casual Sunday clothes, but he pulled himself into professional posture. "Tommy, go to your room."

"But—"

"Now."

Tommy left, confused but obedient. Michael Chen walked to the door, opened it.

Robert Price stood on their front porch in an expensive coat and polished shoes, looking like he'd just come from somewhere important. Or was about to go somewhere important. He looked at Michael Chen with an expression that was cordial and cold at the same time.

"Mr. Chen. Sorry to drop by unannounced. I was hoping we could talk."

"About?" Michael's voice was neutral.

"About our children. About ending this situation before it gets more complicated." Robert's eyes flicked past Michael, found Sophia standing frozen in the kitchen. "Hello, Sophia."

She couldn't speak. Stared at Ethan's father standing in her doorway like a threat made flesh.

"Mr. Price," her father said firmly, "if you want to have a conversation, we can schedule something through appropriate channels. But showing up at my house without notice—"

"Is rude. I know. I apologize." Robert didn't sound apologetic. "But I was in Winnipeg on business, and I thought a face-to-face conversation might be more productive than lawyers passing letters. May I come in? Just for a few minutes."

Sophia watched her parents exchange a look. Then her mother stepped back, opening the door wider.

"Five minutes. In the living room."

Robert Price entered their house.

He looked around as he walked through—taking in the modest furniture, the family photos on the walls, the lived-in warmth of a home that had actual people in it instead of just assets. Sophia couldn't tell if he was judging or just observing.

They sat in the living room—Robert on the armchair, her parents on the couch, Sophia hovering near the kitchen because no one had told her to leave and she wasn't about to miss this.

"So." Michael said. "You wanted to talk."

"I wanted to be direct." Robert leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "I don't think you're bad people. I don't think Sophia is a bad kid. But I think this relationship between her and my son is a distraction neither of them can afford right now."

"That's not your decision to make." Sophia said before she could stop herself.

Robert turned to look at her. "You're right. It's Ethan's decision. But he's seventeen and in love, which means he's not thinking clearly. Someone has to think clearly for him."

"Maybe you should trust him to think for himself."

"Sophia." Her mother warned gently.

"No, let her speak." Robert's attention was fully on her now. "Tell me, Sophia. What's your plan here? You and Ethan. Long-distance for a year and a half, then what? College together? Marriage? Hockey career that supports you both?"

"We haven't planned that far ahead—"

"Exactly. You're living in the moment. Which is fine for teenagers. But I'm responsible for my son's future, which means I have to plan further than the moment." Robert's voice: reasonable, patient, like he was explaining something obvious. "Ethan has potential—real potential—to play Division I hockey, maybe even professional. But only if he stays focused. Only if he doesn't get derailed by relationship drama and long-distance complications."

"His relationship with me isn't drama. It's—"

"It's important to him. I understand that. But Sophia—" Robert's expression was almost sympathetic. "You're smart. You rejected MIT early acceptance. You know about sacrifice for goals. I'm asking you to understand that sometimes the kindest thing is to let go. Let Ethan focus on his trajectory without the weight of trying to maintain a relationship across 800 miles."

"You're asking me to break up with him."

"I'm asking you to consider what's best for him long-term. Not what feels good right now, but what actually serves his future."

"That's enough." Michael said firmly. "Mr. Price, you came here to have a reasonable conversation, but you're asking my daughter to make a choice that isn't yours to request. Sophia and Ethan's relationship is between them. Not you. Not us. Them."

"With respect, Mr. Chen, when that relationship is affecting my son's education and athletic development—"

"Then you talk to your son. Not to a seventeen-year-old girl you're trying to intimidate in her own home." Michael stood. "I think your five minutes are up."

Robert Price stood slowly. He looked at Sophia—regret mixed with determination.

"I'm not trying to be the villain here. I'm trying to protect my son. That's all any parent does." He pulled a business card from his pocket, set it on the coffee table. "My lawyer's information. Because if this conversation doesn't resolve things, the next conversation will be official. I'd rather not go there. But I will if I have to."

He walked to the door. Linda opened it. Robert Price stepped out onto the porch, turned back.

"Sophia. You seem like a bright, accomplished young woman. You have your own future to think about. Don't let someone else's dreams become the reason you compromise yours."

He left.

The door closed. The Chen family stood in stunned silence.

Then Sophia started shaking.

---

The letter arrived on Thursday afternoon.

Sophia had just gotten home from badminton practice, still in her workout clothes, bag slung over her shoulder as she walked through the front door. Her mom was in the kitchen. Something about her posture—rigid, hands braced against the counter—made Sophia stop mid-step.

"Mom?"

Linda Chen turned. Her face was pale, lips pressed into a thin line. On the counter in front of her: a large manila envelope with a return address in small, precise print. Sophia couldn't read it from the doorway, but she could see the law firm letterhead.

"What is that?" Sophia asked, even though she already knew it wasn't good.

"It came certified mail. I had to sign for it." Her mother's voice was carefully controlled. "It's from Robert Price's lawyer."

The air left Sophia's lungs.

She dropped her bag and crossed to the counter, reaching for the envelope. Her mom didn't stop her. Inside: a thick sheaf of papers, official and intimidating. The first page was a letter on expensive letterhead: "Whitmore, Sanderson & Price, Attorneys at Law," with a downtown Minneapolis address.

Sophia's eyes skimmed the text, catching phrases that made her stomach turn:

*...cease and desist all contact with Ethan Price...*

*...interference with the educational and athletic development of a minor...*

*...calculated pattern of behavior designed to manipulate...*

*...should contact persist, our client will pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to restraining orders and complaints to university admissions offices...*

The paper shook in her hands. "This is insane. They can't—they can't accuse me of—"

"Keep reading." Her mother said quietly.

Sophia forced her eyes back to the page. The next paragraph made her knees weak:

*Ms. Chen's conduct demonstrates a calculated seduction of Mr. Price for the purpose of gaining social status and academic leverage. Her rejection of early admission to MIT immediately following Mr. Price's transfer suggests manipulation designed to maintain emotional control. This behavior constitutes harassment and emotional manipulation of a minor.*

"Oh my God." Sophia looked up at her mother, hot tears stinging her eyes. "Mom, this is—this isn't what happened. You know that's not what happened."

"I know, sweetheart."

"We fell in love. That's all we did. How is that illegal? How is loving someone manipulation?"

"It's not." Linda reached out and took the papers from Sophia's shaking hands. "This is Robert Price using the legal system to scare you. To control the situation."

"Is it working?" Sophia's voice cracked. "Because I'm terrified."

"Good reason to be." Her father's voice came from the doorway.

Michael Chen stood there still in his work clothes—suit and tie, briefcase in hand. He must have come home early. His expression was grave as he crossed to the counter and picked up the letter, reading it with the careful attention of someone who understood exactly what legal language meant.

"This is very serious. Robert Price has retained one of the most expensive law firms in Minneapolis. They don't make threats they can't back up."

"But I haven't done anything wrong!" Sophia's voice rose. "I've been at school. I've been at practice. I haven't even seen Ethan since he left!"

Her father's eyes sharpened. "Haven't seen him. But have you been in contact?"

Sophia froze. The burner phone in her backpack might as well have been burning a hole through the fabric. Three late-night calls. Whispered conversations. His voice across 800 miles saying *I love you*.

"Sophia." Her mother said gently. "Have you been talking to him?"

"I—" She couldn't lie. Not to them. Not when they were looking at her like this. "He called. Three times. Late at night. Just to talk."

Her father closed his eyes. "Christ."

"We didn't do anything wrong! We just talked! We're in love and they shipped him to Michigan and we just wanted to hear each other's voices—"

"I know." Michael's voice was tired. "I know, sweetheart. But from a legal perspective, any contact can be construed as violation of their demands. They've documented this. They have grounds."

"Grounds for what?"

"For whatever they want to threaten." He set the papers down. "A restraining order. Complaints to colleges—not just MIT, but anywhere you apply. Character references that paint you as manipulative, predatory—"

"I'm seventeen! Ethan's seventeen! We're the same age! How am I predatory?"

"It doesn't matter what's true. It matters what they can make a court believe. And Robert Price has unlimited resources to build that narrative."

Michael picked up the letter again, reread a section. His jaw tightened. "Listen to this language—'calculated seduction.' This is textbook misogyny, blaming a teenage girl for a relationship. They're weaponizing sexist tropes against you and they know it. This isn't about protecting Ethan. This is about control dressed up in legal language. It's emotional abuse using the legal system as a weapon."

Linda's expression hardened. "We both know what this really is. Wealthy white man with lawyers, using the system against an immigrant family. It's an old story."

"I know." Michael said quietly. "But we're not backing down."

Sophia felt like the floor was tilting. "So what do I do?"

Her parents exchanged a look—one of those married-couple conversations that happened in seconds without words. Then her mother reached out and took Sophia's hand.

"We need to talk to them. Your father and I, with Robert and his wife. Without lawyers, without you and Ethan. Just parents trying to find reasonable solution."

"They're not reasonable. Robert Price is—"

"I know what he is." Her father interrupted. "But we have to try. Because the alternative is letting this escalate to the point where it actually damages your future, and I won't let that happen."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. I already called. Four PM at my office." Michael's expression was grim. "Neutral ground. Professional setting. We'll see if we can talk sense into them."

"And if you can't?"

"Then we get our own lawyer and prepare to fight." He said it with quiet certainty. "But hopefully it won't come to that."

Sophia wanted to believe him. She looked at the letter on the counter, at all those sharp legal words designed to intimidate and control. She thought about Ethan on that bus to Michigan, about his desperate calls from prep school bathrooms, about the fact that they were being treated like criminals for falling in love.

"This isn't fair."

"No." Her mother agreed. "It's not."

"But it's the reality we're dealing with." Her father added. "So tonight, no contact with Ethan. Tomorrow, we meet with his parents. And then we figure out next steps."

"But—"

"No contact, Sophia. I mean it. If they're documenting your behavior, we can't give them more ammunition." Michael's voice was firm but not unkind. "I know it's hard. I know it feels impossible. But you need to trust us on this."

Sophia nodded. Throat too tight to speak. She picked up her bag and headed for the stairs, leaving her parents in the kitchen with that awful letter. In her room, she closed the door and pulled out the burner phone. It sat in her palm—small and innocuous and dangerous all at once.

At 11:45 tonight, it would ring. And she couldn't answer.

She sat on her bed and cried.

---

Her parents returned from the meeting on Friday evening at 6:30 PM.

Sophia had been pacing her room for two hours. Checked her phone approximately four hundred times even though there was nothing to check. Tommy had tried to ask her about homework and she'd nearly bitten his head off. Felt immediately guilty. Apologized. Then gone back to pacing.

When she heard the car in the driveway, she was downstairs in seconds.

Her parents came through the door looking exhausted. Her father's tie loosened, her mother's expression drawn. They saw Sophia hovering in the hallway and her dad gestured to the living room.

"Sit. We need to talk."

The Chen family settled in their living room—parents on the couch, Sophia in the armchair, Tommy sent upstairs despite his protests. The late January sun setting outside, casting long shadows through the windows. Sophia's hands clenched in her lap.

"How bad?"

"Bad." Her father said bluntly. "Robert Price is... he's not interested in compromise. He's interested in complete severance."

"What does that mean?"

"It means he wants you and Ethan to have zero contact. No calls, no texts, no emails, no social media interaction. Nothing." Linda's voice was strained. "He believes Ethan had a perfect trajectory before you became involved, and that your relationship is derailing his son's future."

"That's insane. Ethan makes his own choices—"

"We know." Her father interrupted. "We told him that. Repeatedly. But Price doesn't see it that way. He sees his son as an investment—millions of dollars in training and coaching and opportunities—and you as the variable that's disrupting returns."

Sophia felt sick. "Did you meet Ethan's mom? Catherine?"

"Briefly." Her mother's expression softened slightly. "She seemed conflicted. Didn't say much. But the few times she spoke, it was more sympathetic to the situation than Robert."

"Robert dominated the entire meeting." Her father added. "Laid out his position: complete separation until graduation. After that, if you and Ethan still want to reconnect, that's your choice as legal adults. But until then, no contact."

"That's over a year away! We're supposed to just not talk for eighteen months?"

"That's what he's demanding." Michael pulled a business card from his pocket and set it on the coffee table. Same law firm letterhead. "And if you don't comply, they'll pursue legal action."

"What kind of legal action?"

"Restraining order first. Then complaints to every college you're applying to, suggesting you have behavioral issues and manipulative tendencies. Character assassination designed to tank your admissions prospects." Her father's voice was clinical but she could hear the anger underneath. "They'll also go after anyone who helps you contact Ethan—friends, classmates, anyone. Threaten their families with legal action for enabling harassment."

"But it's not harassment! We're in a relationship!"

"Which they characterize as you manipulating their son." Linda's voice was gentle but firm. "I know it's not true. Your father knows it's not true. But they have expensive lawyers who can make it sound true in documents that college admissions officers will read."

Sophia felt like she was drowning. "So what do I do? Just give up?"

Her parents looked at each other again. Then her father leaned forward, elbows on his knees, spoke in a lower voice.

"Look. Officially, we're telling you: no contact. That's the requirement. That's what keeps you safe from legal consequences."

"But unofficially?" Sophia asked, catching the nuance.

"Unofficially," her mother said carefully, "we understand that you're seventeen years old and in love. We understand that demanding you completely cut off contact with someone you care about is unreasonable and cruel."

"What your mother is saying is that if hypothetically you found ways to communicate that were discreet and untraceable, we wouldn't be in a position to know about it." Her father continued. "And what we don't know, we can't be held responsible for."

Sophia stared at them. "Are you telling me to sneak around?"

"We're telling you to be smart." Linda said firmly. "We're telling you that if you choose to maintain contact, it needs to be invisible. No phone records they can subpoena. No social media they can screenshot. No evidence that anyone could use against you."

"Because if they catch you, we can't protect you from the consequences." Michael added. "Legal action, college sabotage—all of it becomes real. Do you understand?"

"I understand."

"One more thing." Her father picked up the business card, turned it over. On the back was handwritten a single line: "I'm sorry. Be careful. —C"

"C?" Sophia asked.

"Catherine Price." Her mother said quietly. "While Robert was talking to the lawyers in the hallway, she slipped this to me. Then she looked at me and said, 'I was seventeen once too.'"

Sophia's throat closed. Ethan's mother. The woman she'd never officially met, but who'd just acknowledged—in the smallest, most dangerous way—that she understood. That she was sorry. That she couldn't help but she wasn't completely against them.

"So. Officially, no contact. Unofficially, invisible contact. And if I get caught, it's on me."

"Yes." Her father confirmed.

"And Robert Price is monitoring everything he can think of."

"Yes."

"Phone records, social media, probably email."

"Probably." Her mother agreed.

"So I'd need to be creative."

"Very creative. And very careful."

Sophia nodded slowly. Already thinking. Burner phones were good but not perfect—they created a trail if you weren't careful about where you bought them, where you called from. Social media was completely out. Regular email was monitored.

But there were other ways.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Do you think I'm making a mistake? Holding on to this relationship?"

Her parents exchanged another look. Then her mother reached over and took Sophia's hand.

"I think you're seventeen and in love, and that's not a mistake—it's being human." Linda said. "I think the situation is complicated and unfair and you're handling it with more grace than most adults would. I think Robert Price is trying to control what can't be controlled, and that's going to backfire on him eventually."

"And I think," her father added, "that if Ethan Price is the kind of young man willing to stand up to his father for you, willing to be sent away rather than let you go, then he's probably worth fighting for. Just fight smart. Okay?"

"Okay." Sophia squeezed her mother's hand. "Thank you. For understanding. For not making me choose between you and him."

"You're our daughter. We're on your side. Always."

They sat together in the dimming light, the weight of impossible choices settling over them all. Outside, January cold pressed against the windows. Inside, the Chen family made their quiet pact: official compliance and secret rebellion.

It wasn't perfect. But it was something.

---

By Monday morning, the gossip had evolved.

Sophia heard the new version in whispers as she walked through the hallway: restraining order, legal battle, lawyers involved. Some of it accurate. Most of it wildly exaggerated. All of it made her want to scream.

"Heard her parents are suing his parents."

"No, his parents are suing her parents."

"I heard there's actually a restraining order. Like, she can't contact him at all."

"That's so dramatic. It's just high school dating."

"Yeah, but his dad is like, super rich. Probably doesn't want some girl messing up his son's hockey career."

Sophia kept her head down and her expression neutral. Maya was waiting at her locker with a look that said she'd heard everything and was ready to throw down with anyone who said something to Sophia's face.

"People are idiots." Maya announced as Sophia approached.

"Accurate."

"Want me to start a rumor that you're actually a Russian spy and the legal stuff is international espionage cover?"

Despite everything, Sophia almost smiled. "Tempting. But probably won't help."

"Fair." Maya leaned against the locker next to Sophia's. "So what really happened? If you want to talk about it."

Sophia glanced around. The hallway was crowded, voices echoing off lockers and linoleum. Not here. She jerked her head toward the stairs and Maya followed. They climbed to the third floor, to the quiet corner by the old music rooms that nobody used anymore. Sophia gave her the abbreviated version: cease and desist letter, parents' meeting, Robert Price's ultimatum, the visit to her house Sunday morning.

"Holy shit. That's actually terrifying."

"Yeah."

"So you're just supposed to not talk to him? For a year and a half?"

"That's what they want."

"But you're not going to do that." Maya said it as statement, not question.

Sophia looked at her best friend—at the person who'd stood by her through all of this without judgment or conditions. "If I told you I needed help with something that could get complicated, would you help me?"

"Yes."

"Even if it might cause problems for you?"

"Sophia. Yes. Obviously yes. What do you need?"

"I need a way to communicate with Ethan that's invisible. That can't be traced or monitored or used as evidence. And I need people I can trust."

Maya was already nodding. "Encrypted messaging apps. Burner phones are good but they leave purchase records. Apps with end-to-end encryption, installed on devices that aren't linked to your real identity."

"How do I get a device not linked to my identity?"

"Leave that to me. I know people." At Sophia's surprised look, Maya grinned. "You're not the only one who knows how to be creative. Give me a week. I'll have something set up."

"Maya—"

"Don't. Don't thank me or apologize or any of that. You're my best friend. I've got your back." Maya's expression turned more serious. "But you need to be smart about this. If Price's lawyers are really monitoring things, they're probably looking at who you talk to, who might be helping you. We need to be careful."

"I know."

"Okay. Then let's be careful together."

They walked back downstairs. Sophia felt fractionally less alone.

---

The solution came from an unexpected source.

Tuesday after school, Sophia was loading her bag into her car when Jordan Nakamura appeared, leaning against the vehicle next to hers.

Jordan was Ethan's teammate—former teammate—and one of the few hockey players who'd been genuinely nice to her from the start. Tall, Japanese-Canadian, with dark hair and an easy smile that made him popular without being obnoxious about it. More importantly, he was friends with both Sophia and Ethan.

"Need to talk to you. About Ethan."

Sophia's guard went up immediately. "If you're here to tell me to stay away from him—"

"I'm not." Jordan pushed off the car, hands in his pockets. "I'm here to offer to help."

"Help how?"

"Can we walk? Less suspicious than standing in parking lot."

They walked to the athletic fields, empty now in the late afternoon cold. Jordan didn't speak until they were well away from the school building, their breath forming clouds in the freezing air.

"So. Ethan called me last night. From the burner phone."

Sophia's heart jumped. "Is he okay?"

"He's surviving. But he's worried about you. Said his dad is escalating things legally, that you might not be able to talk to him anymore." Jordan glanced at her. "Said he needs to know you're okay, but he doesn't want to put you at risk by calling."

"I'm okay." Sophia said automatically. Then, more honestly: "I'm not okay. But I'm handling it."

"Yeah, well, that's what he figured you'd say." Jordan stopped walking, turned to face her fully. "Look. I'm Switzerland, okay? I'm friends with both of you. I don't care about the drama or the gossip or whatever Price's dad thinks about the situation. I care that two of my friends are being forced apart by someone's control issues."

"Okay..."

"So here's what I'm offering. I'm a neutral party. Price's lawyers can't claim I'm helping you violate anything because I'm not involved in your relationship—I'm just talking to my friends. Separately. As friends do."

Understanding dawned. "You want to be a go-between."

"Exactly. You can't email Ethan directly—monitored. You can't call him on regular phone—monitored. Burner phones are risky—purchase records, location data. But you can talk to me. And I can talk to him. And if, hypothetically, information gets passed along in those completely separate conversations..." Jordan shrugged. "That's just friends talking."

"Why would you risk this? If they find out you're helping—"

"They won't find out. And even if they do, what are they going to do? I'm not family. I'm not involved. I'm just a guy who talks to his friends." Jordan's expression turned more serious. "Besides, what Price is doing is wrong. You guys didn't do anything except fall in love, and he's trying to control that with money and lawyers. That's bullshit."

Tears pricked Sophia's eyes. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. This has limits." Jordan pulled out his phone. "We need codes. Ways to communicate that don't sound suspicious if anyone sees messages. And we need to be careful about frequency—can't be texting constantly or it looks coordinated."

"Codes like what?"

"Like if you need to tell him something important, text me about homework. Chemistry homework means you need him to call the burner phone. Physics homework means you need to send a message. English homework means emergency."

"And how does he get messages to me?"

"Same system reversed. I'll give him the codes. He'll text me about practice." Jordan was already typing notes into his phone. "Line drills means he needs to talk to you. Scrimmage means he has message to send. Game time means emergency."

"This is complicated."

"It has to be. Price isn't stupid. We need to make this look completely innocent." Jordan met her eyes. "You in?"

"I'm in." Sophia didn't even hesitate.

"Good. Give me your school email—that's public, they can't object to me having it. I'll never use it for actual communication, but it needs to be visible that we're connected. And give me your actual phone number so I can text you about 'homework.'"

They exchanged information. Then Jordan walked her through the code system once more, making sure she had it memorized. By the time they headed back to the parking lot, Sophia felt like she could breathe for the first time since the cease and desist letter arrived.

"One more thing." Jordan said as they reached their cars. "He wanted me to give you this."

He pulled a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket—small and worn like it had been carried carefully. Sophia took it. Her hands trembling slightly.

"When did he give you this?"

"Mailed it to my house. Arrived yesterday." Jordan smiled slightly. "He's smart, your boyfriend. Figured out the mail system faster than the phone system."

Sophia clutched the paper. "Thank you, Jordan. Seriously. You're—this is—"

"Go. Read it in private. And text me about that chemistry homework later—pretty sure he's waiting to hear you got the message." Jordan got into his car, waved, drove off.

Sophia got in her own car, locked the doors, unfolded the paper with shaking hands.

---

The letter was three pages, written in Ethan's precise handwriting on what looked like notebook paper carefully torn out.

*Sophia,*

*If you're reading this, it means Jordan came through. I'm trusting him because I don't have many options, and because he's one of the few people who treats you like a person instead of a scandal. If you're not ready to trust him, that's okay too. But I hope you are, because I need to tell you things, and this seems like the safest way.*

*First: I'm sorry. I'm sorry my father is doing this. I'm sorry you have to deal with legal threats and lawyers and all of this insanity when all we did was fall in love. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you from this, couldn't stop it, can't fix it.*

*Second: Don't give up on us. I know that sounds selfish when you're the one dealing with consequences at home. I know you're the one facing your parents' disappointment and school gossip and cease and desist letters. I know it would be easier for you to walk away and tell everyone I'm not worth the trouble.*

*But I'm asking you not to. I'm asking you to hold on. Because I'm holding on too, and I need to know you're there on the other end of this distance.*

*Here's what life is like in Michigan: sterile, controlled, suffocating. The prep school is nice on the surface—good facilities, smart teachers, high-level hockey program. But everything is monitored. Room checks, schedule adherence, academic performance metrics, athletic benchmarks. My roommate reports to his dad about my behavior, and his dad probably reports to my dad. I can't go anywhere without permission. Can't buy anything without it showing up on accounts my parents can access. Can't call anyone without it being logged.*

*I got the burner phone by asking Jordan to mail me cash, then buying it during weekend "earned recreation time" with cash. Paid a senior here to buy it for me so my face wasn't on any store cameras. Had to think like a spy just to talk to you.*

*The phone got confiscated last week. I was late to room check because I was calling you from the bathroom, and they searched my stuff the next day. Gave me three days of in-school suspension, loss of weekend privileges, and interrogation about who I was calling. I told them friend from Winnipeg. They didn't believe me but couldn't prove otherwise.*

*So now I have no phone at all. School-issued tablet that's monitored for all communications. Which is why I'm writing this by hand in physics class, hiding it between notebook pages, and will mail it to Jordan's house because I can send personal mail if it goes through the school office (they check, but they don't read everything—too much volume).*

*I'm telling you all this not to make you feel sorry for me. I'm telling you so you understand: this is the cost of not letting you go. My father wanted me to cut you out, move on, focus on hockey. I refused. So this is the consequence—this surveillance, this control, this distance. And I'd make the same choice again.*

*Because here's what they don't understand: you're not a distraction from my life. You're part of what makes my life make sense. Before you, I was just going through motions. Good grades because that's what I was supposed to get. Good hockey because that's what I was supposed to play. But no idea why I was doing any of it.*

*You asked me questions. You made me think. You challenged me to figure out what I actually wanted instead of what everyone told me to want. And what I want is to be someone who matters to people who matter to me. I want to be someone who solves problems and understands the world and makes things better. I want to be someone who chooses love even when it's hard.*

*I want to be someone who deserves you.*

*The physics teacher here, Dr. Morrison, is brilliant. We talked about quantum mechanics yesterday—wave-particle duality, observer effect, all this stuff about how observation changes reality. And I thought about you. About how you observe the world with this precise, curious intensity. How you make me see things I would have missed. How you change my reality just by being in it.*

*I miss you. I miss talking to you about everything and nothing. I miss making you laugh. I miss the way you explain science like you're sharing secrets about the universe. I miss watching you play badminton with that intense focus that makes you unstoppable. I miss kissing you. God, I miss kissing you.*

*But I can wait. I can survive this surveillance and these months of separation. I can handle my father's control and this clinical prep school existence. I can do all of it as long as I know you're there. As long as I know this isn't over.*

*So don't let it be over. Please.*

*Use Jordan if you need to. Use whatever system works. I'll find ways to reach you—letters like this, maybe other methods I haven't thought of yet. We'll be smarter than they are. More creative. More determined.*

*Because they can control phones and email and where I live and who I talk to. But they can't control how I feel. They can't make me stop loving you. And they can't win if we refuse to let them.*

*I have to go—class is ending and I need to hide this before my roommate sees. I'll get it mailed today. By the time you read it, it'll be early February. Which means we're one month closer to summer. One month closer to being in the same state again. One month closer to the end of junior year.*

*We can do this. I know we can.*

*I love you. That's the only thing I'm sure of anymore.*

*—E*

*P.S. - If you send letters back through Jordan, use codes we'd understand but no one else would. Astronomy terms, maybe? Call me "Cygnus" and yourself "Lyra"—constellation names from that night in October. That way if anyone intercepts it, it just looks like school project notes.*

Sophia read the letter three times sitting in her car in the school parking lot. By the third reading, she was crying too hard to see the words clearly.

He was suffering. Being watched and controlled and isolated. And he was still fighting for them.

She pulled out her regular phone and texted Jordan: *Got the chemistry homework. Thanks for the help.*

Three minutes later: *Cool. Let me know if you need more help with those problem sets.*

Translation: Message received. System working.

Sophia wiped her eyes, started her car, drove home. In her room, she pulled out clean notebook paper and began to write.

*Cygnus,*

*Your message about the quantum mechanics problem set was really helpful...*

She wrote for an hour, telling him about her parents' tacit permission to be invisible, about school and badminton and the way she was holding together. She wrote about Maya's fierce loyalty and how Coach Kim seemed to understand without being told. She wrote about the cease and desist letter and her own fear, but also her determination.

She wrote about love in the language of physics and astronomy, calling herself Lyra and him Cygnus, writing about stellar distances and gravitational pulls and the way light travels across impossible space to reach waiting eyes.

At the end, she wrote: *The observer effect is real. You change my reality too. Keep observing. Keep existing. Keep being you. I'm here. I'm holding on. We're going to make it.*

*—Lyra*

She folded it carefully, put it in an envelope addressed to Jordan Nakamura, mailed it before she could second-guess herself.

That night at 11:45, Sophia's burner phone didn't ring.

She lay in the dark, missing him, holding his letter like a talisman.

But she wasn't alone anymore. She had a system. She had help. She had his words on paper saying *don't let it be over*.

And she wouldn't.

They couldn't stop her from loving him. They couldn't stop her from fighting.

They could make it hard. They could make it complicated. They could throw lawyers and surveillance and distance at them.

But they couldn't win.

Not if she refused to let them.
