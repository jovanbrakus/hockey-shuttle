## PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (✅ ALL COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Episode 5 opened with MIT decision already made, but Episode 4 ended with Sophia having 24 hours to decide.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added **NEW opening scene**: Sophia at 2:47 AM on January 3rd, torn letter sequence (~1,200 words)

### 2. ✅ WROTE MISSING DRIVEWAY CONFRONTATION SCENE

**Problem**: Outline promised explosive driveway scene, but Chapter 4 draft ended before it happened.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Wrote complete confrontation scene (~1,800 words)
- Both sets of parents waiting in driveway (they lied about Grand Forks)
- Public argument with neighbors watching
- Sophia's parents discovering hotel room situation
- Robert's cold threats, Ethan's defiance
- "I love you" exchange in front of parents and neighbors
- Neighbor concern about raised voices (public exposure of Price family control)
- Ethan still choosing to go to Michigan (more nuanced than refusing)

**Impact**: Delivers on promised dramatic confrontation, raises stakes, makes separation more complex

---

### 3. ✅ FIXED CLIFFHANGER - Cut Sunday Scene, Rewrote Ending

**Problem**: Sunday morning Robert visit provided closure and undermined cliffhanger tension.

**Solution Implemented**:
- CUT entire Sunday morning Robert house visit scene
- Ended episode Saturday night at moment of maximum tension
- **NEW CLIFFHANGER**: Robert sends legal threat (restraining order) via Sophia's mom's phone while Sophia is texting Ethan
- Sophia must choose: safety or defiance
- Final exchange shows her choosing defiance: "It's not working. It's pissing me off."
- Ends with countdown: 68 days
