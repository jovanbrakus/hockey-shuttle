# CHAPTER 2: THE ROAD

## JANUARY 5, JUNIOR YEAR

The world was still dark when they hit Highway 75 heading south. Sophia watched the city lights disappear behind them, replaced by endless stretches of snow-covered farmland. Manitoba in January looked like the end of the world—flat white nothing in every direction, the sky heavy and gray even though sunrise was coming.

Ethan drove carefully, both hands on the wheel. The roads were clear for now, but snow fell steadily, accumulating on the shoulders. They hadn't spoken much since leaving. There was something about the early morning quiet, the isolation of the highway, that made conversation feel unnecessary.

Sophia was content just to be here, in this truck, watching his profile in the dashboard light.

At six-thirty, the sun started to rise. It came up slow and red on the eastern horizon, turning the snow pink and gold. Ethan glanced at it, then at Sophia.

"You okay?" he asked. First words in thirty minutes.

"Yeah. Just watching."

"Watching what?"

"Everything. The sunrise. The road. You."

He smiled, quick and genuine. "Creepy."

"Romantic."

"Creepily romantic."

She laughed and settled deeper into her seat. The truck's heater hummed, the radio played quietly—some indie playlist Ethan must have made because it was all artists she'd never heard of but somehow fit perfectly. The GPS said four more hours to Grand Forks.

Four hours of this. Just driving. Just being together.

It felt like stolen time.

"Can I ask you something?" Ethan said as they passed a sign for Emerson, the border crossing still an hour away.

"Yeah."

"When you tore up that MIT letter. What did it feel like?"

Sophia thought about it. "Scary. Exciting. Right."

"All at once?"

"Yeah. Like—you know when you're about to do something you know you shouldn't do, but you're going to do it anyway? That feeling."

"I know that feeling." His mouth twisted wryly. "I'm having that feeling right now."

"About this?"

"About all of it. Driving you to North Dakota. Leaving for prep school. Everything." He was quiet for a moment. "My dad said something last night. After the game. He said, 'Four more days and you'll be on track again.' Like I've been derailed. Like spending time with you is me going off course."

Sophia's chest tightened. "What do you think?"

"I think—" He paused, choosing words carefully. "I think for my whole life, I've been on their track. And it's a good track. NHL, money, success, everything they want for me. But I don't know if it's my track. And spending time with you—it's the first time I've felt like maybe I could have a different track. Maybe I could choose something different."

"Like what?"

"I don't know yet. That's the problem." He glanced at her. "You said you want to keep your options open. That you're not sure what you want to study. Do you—do you ever feel like you're supposed to have it all figured out by now?"

"All the time," Sophia admitted. "Everyone keeps asking what I want to major in, and I don't know. I like badminton, but I don't want to do it professionally. I'm good at science, but I don't know if I want to be an engineer. I draw sometimes, but I'm not good enough to study art. I write in journals, but that's not a real thing. I just—I want to try everything. But that's not how it works, apparently. You're supposed to pick one thing and commit."

"Why?"

"What?"

"Why are you supposed to pick one thing? Why can't you do multiple things?"

Sophia blinked. "Because—I don't know. Because that's how college works? You pick a major?"

"But you can have a major and a minor. You can double major. You can take random classes just because they're interesting." He was warming to the idea, his voice getting more animated. "Like, I'm going to study astrophysics if I go to college. But that doesn't mean I can't also take art classes. Or play hockey. Or do whatever else seems interesting."

"Your dad would have a heart attack if you told him you wanted to take art classes."

"Probably." He grinned. "Which is kind of a point in favor of it."

Sophia laughed. "Rebellion through art appreciation."

"Exactly."

They fell into comfortable silence again. Outside, the landscape rolled by—fields, farmhouses, the occasional small town. Signs counted down kilometers to the border. The snow kept falling, steady but not yet concerning.

At seven-thirty, Ethan pulled into a Tim Hortons just before the border crossing. They got coffee and breakfast sandwiches, ate in the truck with the engine running.

"You nervous?" he asked, gesturing ahead to where the border crossing was visible. "About nationals?"

"A little. This is my third time going, so it should feel routine. But it doesn't."

"Why not?"

"Because—" She paused, trying to articulate it. "Because you're here. Because everything feels different this time. Because I keep thinking about the tournament being over and having to come back and you being gone."

He reached across the console and took her hand. "Hey. We're not there yet. We still have three days."

"I know. But it feels like they're already slipping away."

"Then we don't let them slip. We pay attention. We're present. We make them count." He squeezed her hand. "Deal?"

"Deal."

They finished breakfast and got back on the highway. The border crossing was quick—the agent barely glanced at their IDs, asked where they were going, waved them through. And then they were in the United States, Highway 75 continuing south through North Dakota.

The landscape didn't change much. Still flat, still white, still endless. But something about crossing the border made it feel more real. They were really doing this. They were really two teenagers in a truck driving into a winter storm warning because they had three days left together and they weren't going to waste them.

"Put on some music," Ethan said. "My phone's connected. Pick whatever you want."

Sophia grabbed his phone from the cupholder, unlocked it—he'd told her his passcode weeks ago, a small intimacy she still found significant—and scrolled through his playlists. She picked one labeled "Road Trip" and pressed play.

The first song was something acoustic and folky, a woman's voice singing about highways and leaving home. It was perfect.

"When did you make this playlist?" Sophia asked.

"Last night. Couldn't sleep, so I made a playlist for the drive."

"It's good."

"Yeah?" He glanced at her, looking pleased. "I wasn't sure if it was too sad."

"It's not sad. It's—" She searched for the word. "Bittersweet."

"That works."

They drove. The playlist continued, song after song, each one somehow fitting the moment. The snow kept falling. The highway stretched out endlessly ahead. And Sophia felt herself relaxing into it—the rhythm of driving, the warmth of the truck, the presence of Ethan beside her.

This was what she'd wanted. This exact thing. Just time together, no pressure, no parents watching, no friends asking questions. Just them and the road and three days that belonged to no one else.

"Tell me something," Ethan said as they passed a sign for Grand Forks: 140 kilometers.

"Like what?"

"Something I don't know about you. Something you've never told anyone."

Sophia thought about it. "I can't think of anything. You know everything."

"I don't know everything. Come on. Something small. A secret."

She smiled. "Okay. Um. When we were kids—before you moved—I had this notebook where I used to write about you."

His eyebrows shot up. "What?"

"Not like a diary. Just—I don't know. I'd write down things you said that I thought were funny. Or things we did together. I wanted to remember."

"Do you still have it?"

"Yeah. It's in a box in my closet. I found it a few months ago, actually. After we started hanging out again."

"What did it say?"

"Mostly just kid stuff. 'Ethan and I skated for two hours today. He taught me how to stop without falling.' 'Ethan said the ice looks like glass when the Zamboni finishes.' Things like that." She felt her face heating. "It's embarrassing."

"It's not embarrassing. It's—" He paused, and when he spoke again, his voice was quieter. "It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I wish I'd done that. Written things down. I don't remember a lot from when we were kids. Just—impressions. The feeling of being with you. But not specific things."

"What do you remember?"

He was quiet for a long moment, eyes on the road. Finally: "I remember thinking you were the only person who didn't care about hockey. Like, everyone else—kids, parents, coaches—they all cared about whether I won or lost, how many goals I scored, whether I was good enough. But you just wanted to skate with me. You didn't care if I could do a slap shot or whatever. You just liked being on the ice."

"I did like being on the ice."

"I know. And I loved that about you." He glanced at her. "I still love that about you. You're the only person who sees me as more than hockey."

Sophia's throat was tight. "You're more than hockey."

"I know. But most people don't know that. Or don't care." He turned his attention back to the road. "Your turn. Something else I don't know."

"Um." She scrambled to think. "Okay. I almost quit badminton last year."

"What? Why?"

"Because I wasn't the best. I was good, but not the best. And I kept thinking, what's the point of doing something if you're not the best at it? But then I realized—I liked playing. I liked the competition, the strategy, the way it felt when I won. And that was enough. I didn't have to be the best. I just had to enjoy it."

Ethan nodded slowly. "I've never felt that way about hockey."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean—I've always had to be the best. There was never a question of just enjoying it. It was always about winning, improving, being better than everyone else. And now I don't know how to just—enjoy something. Without it being a competition."

"You enjoy art museums."

"True."

"And you enjoy being with me. I hope."

He laughed. "Yes. I definitely enjoy being with you."

"See? You can enjoy things without competing."

"Maybe you're teaching me that."

"Good. You need to learn it."

They drove on. The landscape gradually shifted—slightly less flat, more trees, signs for small North Dakota towns. The snow was heavier now, big fat flakes that the wipers had to clear every few seconds. Ethan turned on the defroster.

"Storm's starting early," he said, checking the rearview mirror.

"Are we still okay to drive?"

"Yeah, roads are fine. It's just snow. We'll be in Grand Forks in less than two hours."

"And if it gets worse?"

"Then we pull over and wait it out." He said it so casually, like it wasn't a big deal. "We have time. Tournament doesn't start until this afternoon."

Sophia checked her phone. Her first match was at three PM. It was barely nine-thirty now. Plenty of time.

Still, something about the heavy snow made her nervous.

"Tell me more things," Ethan said. "Keep my mind off the weather."

"What do you want to know?"

"College. Where are you actually thinking of applying?"

"Everywhere. Ivy League schools, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, maybe some liberal arts colleges. I'm casting a wide net."

"What about Northwestern? That's near Chicago, right?"

"Yeah. Why?"

"Just wondering." But his voice had a strange tone, carefully neutral.

"Ethan. Why are you asking about Northwestern?"

He was quiet for a beat. Then: "Because I might end up there."

"For hockey?"

"Yeah. It's one of the schools recruiting me. Good academics, good hockey program, close to home but not too close."

Sophia's heart jumped. "When do you have to decide?"

"Not until next year. But it's on the list." He glanced at her. "If you got into Northwestern, and I got into Northwestern—"

"Don't," she interrupted.

"Don't what?"

"Don't plan that far ahead. Don't make me hope for something that might not happen."

"Why not?"

"Because—" Her voice cracked. "Because in three days you're leaving and I don't know when I'll see you again. And if I start hoping we could go to college together, it's going to hurt worse when it doesn't work out."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "What if it does work out?"

"Then we'll deal with it when it happens. But right now—right now I just need these three days. I can't think about next year. It's too much."

He didn't argue. Just drove in silence for a while, the windshield wipers beating steadily. Sophia felt bad for shutting him down, but she also knew herself. If she let herself dream about college together, about a future past this separation, the crash when reality hit would destroy her.

Better to stay in the moment. These three days. Nothing more.

"I'm sorry," Ethan said finally. "You're right. Present tense. Three days."

"Three days," she agreed.

"Okay. Then tell me about this tournament. What's your strategy?"

She let him change the subject, grateful. Talked about her bracket, the players she'd be facing, the techniques she'd been working on. He listened intently, asking questions, genuinely interested. It reminded her of when they were kids, when he'd ask about badminton with the same focus he brought to hockey.

He'd always been good at that—making her feel like what she cared about mattered.

At eleven o'clock, they crossed into the outskirts of Grand Forks. The snow was falling heavily now, visibility reduced but still manageable. Ethan drove carefully through town, following the GPS to the Alerus Center where the tournament was being held.

The parking lot was half-full. Sophia spotted her team's bus—Coach Martinez must have brought everyone down yesterday, given the storm warnings. Her stomach twisted with guilt. She should have been on that bus.

"You okay?" Ethan asked, parking in a far corner away from the bus.

"Yeah. Just—my coach is going to ask questions."

"What are you going to say?"

"That a friend drove me. Which is true."

"You want me to come in with you?"

"No. Better if they don't see you. I'll check in, find out my match times, and text you."

He nodded. "I'll go find a hotel. Get a room for tonight."

"Just tonight?"

"We'll see how the storm is tomorrow. If we need to stay another night, I'll extend it."

Sophia grabbed her competition bag from the back seat. Before she could open the door, Ethan caught her hand.

"Hey," he said. "Good luck today. You're going to be amazing."

"Thanks."

"I mean it. You're one of the best players in the country. Don't forget that."

She kissed him quickly, then climbed out of the truck before she could lose her nerve. The cold hit her immediately, wind-driven snow stinging her face. She shouldered her bag and walked toward the Alerus Center entrance, not looking back.

Inside, the building was warm and loud—badminton courts set up everywhere, players warming up, coaches shouting instructions. Sophia found the check-in table and gave her name.

"Sophia Chen?" The woman checked her list. "You're in bracket A, court three. First match at three PM. Second match at six PM if you win."

"Thanks."

She turned to find Coach Martinez walking toward her, expression concerned. "Sophia! I was worried. You weren't on the bus yesterday."

"I know. I'm sorry. I had a ride."

"From who?"

"A friend."

Coach Martinez's eyes narrowed. "What friend?"

"Just—someone from Winnipeg. They were driving down anyway."

"Sophia." Her coach's voice was gentle but firm. "I need to know who you're traveling with. For safety."

Sophia sighed. "Ethan Price. He's—we're friends. He drove me down."

Coach Martinez's eyebrows rose. "The hockey player? The one going to prep school?"

"Yeah."

"And your parents know about this?"

"They know I'm here for the tournament."

Which wasn't really an answer, and Coach Martinez clearly knew it. But after a long moment, she just nodded. "Alright. Well. You're here. That's what matters. Your first match is in four hours. Get warmed up. And Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"Be careful. With the storm and—everything else."

"I will."

Coach Martinez walked away, leaving Sophia alone in the middle of the crowded arena. She pulled out her phone and texted Ethan: *First match at 3. Second at 6 if I win. Where are you?*

His reply came immediately: *Holiday Inn on South Washington. Room 247. Text me when you're done and I'll come watch your matches.*

*You don't have to.*

*I want to. I drove four hours to watch you play. Let me watch you play.*

She smiled despite herself: *Okay. See you at 3.*

She found her team in the warm-up area. Maya saw her and came over immediately. "Oh my God, you made it! How was the drive?"

"Long. Snowy. Fine."

"Is he here?"

"Yeah. Getting a hotel."

Maya grinned. "This is so romantic I could die."

"It's terrifying."

"Same thing." Maya linked their arms. "Come on. Let's warm up. You have four hours to get your head in the game."

---

Sophia's first match was at three PM against a player from Saskatchewan. She won in straight games, 21-14, 21-16. It wasn't her best performance—she was distracted, kept thinking about the snow outside—but it was enough.

When she walked off the court, she saw Ethan in the stands. He was in the very back row, wearing a baseball cap and hoodie, clearly trying to be inconspicuous. When their eyes met, he gave her a subtle thumbs up.

Her heart did something complicated in her chest.

Her second match was at six PM against an Ontario player who was ranked higher. This match was harder—she lost the first game 21-18, fought back to win the second 21-17, and took the third 21-19. When the final point landed, she collapsed to her knees, gasping.

She'd made it to semifinals.

Which meant one more match tomorrow.

Which meant one more day in Grand Forks.

Which meant one more night with Ethan.

She found him waiting outside the locker room after she'd showered and changed. He was leaning against the wall, scrolling through his phone, and when he looked up and saw her, his whole face brightened.

"You were incredible," he said.

"I was okay."

"You were incredible," he insisted. "That third game—I thought my heart was going to explode."

She laughed. "Imagine how I felt."

"Come on. I'm starving. Let's get dinner."

They walked out to the parking lot together. The snow was much heavier now, already several inches accumulated on his truck. Ethan brushed it off while Sophia climbed inside.

"Storm's getting worse," he said, starting the engine.

"Do you think we'll be able to drive back tomorrow?"

"Let's see what it looks like in the morning. Tournament rescheduling anything?"

Sophia checked her email. "Nothing yet. Semifinals are scheduled for noon tomorrow."

"Then we have time."

They drove through Grand Forks, searching for somewhere to eat. The roads were getting slippery, traffic moving slowly. Most restaurants looked closed or closing early because of the storm.

Finally they found an Italian place downtown that was still open. Inside, it was warm and cozy, with candles on the tables and soft music playing. They got a corner booth and ordered pasta and wine—Ethan had a fake ID that worked about half the time, and apparently this was one of those times.

"To semifinals," Ethan said, raising his glass.

"To semifinals," Sophia echoed.

They clinked glasses and drank. The wine was terrible, cheap and sour, but somehow that made it perfect. They were two teenagers in North Dakota drinking bad wine while a blizzard started outside. It was absurd and wonderful.

"Question," Ethan said, twirling pasta onto his fork. "If you could do anything tomorrow—anything at all, no consequences—what would you do?"

Sophia thought about it. "Stay here."

"Here?"

"In Grand Forks. In this bubble where no one knows us and we can just be together. Cancel semifinals, cancel prep school, cancel everything. Just—stay."

He nodded slowly. "Yeah. I'd choose that too."

"But we can't."

"No. We can't." He took another drink of wine. "So we take what we can get. Tonight. Tomorrow. Sunday morning. And then—"

"And then you leave," Sophia finished.

"And then I leave," he agreed. "But I come back."

"When?"

"I don't know. Spring break, maybe? That's only ten weeks."

"Ten weeks is forever."

"It's not forever. It's seventy days."

"You counted?"

"Yeah. I counted." He reached across the table and took her hand. "Seventy days. We can do seventy days."

Sophia wanted to believe him. She wanted to believe ten weeks was manageable, that they could survive the separation, that what they had was strong enough to last through distance and parental pressure and all the other forces working against them.

But sitting in that restaurant, watching snow pile up outside, she felt the weight of everything they were up against.

"Hey," Ethan said softly. "Where'd you go?"

"I'm right here."

"No you're not. You're spiraling. I can see it."

"I'm not spiraling."

"Sophia."

She sighed. "Okay. Maybe I'm spiraling a little."

"Tell me what you're thinking."

"I'm thinking—" She paused, trying to articulate it. "I'm thinking that everyone is right. Your parents, my parents, everyone. That this is too hard. That we're too young. That long distance doesn't work. That we should just—let go. Before it hurts worse."

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. Then he said, "Is that what you want? To let go?"

"No. But wanting something doesn't make it possible."

"It doesn't make it impossible either." He squeezed her hand. "Look. I know this is hard. I know the odds are against us. But I don't care. I'd rather try and fail than not try at all. Wouldn't you?"

"I don't know. I've never tried something I knew would probably fail."

"Well, now's your chance." He smiled, but it was sad around the edges. "Come on. Let's be stupidly optimistic teenagers together. Let's believe we can make this work. At least for tonight."

Sophia looked at him—at his hopeful, heartbroken face—and felt something shift inside her. He was right. She'd spent so much time being careful, being realistic, being the good daughter who made smart choices. But where had that gotten her?

Maybe it was time to be stupid.

"Okay," she said.

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Stupidly optimistic teenagers. For tonight."

His smile widened, genuine this time. "Good."

They finished dinner slowly, talking about everything and nothing. The restaurant gradually emptied until they were the last customers. Finally the waiter came over with the check and a apologetic smile.

"Sorry folks, we're closing up. Storm's getting bad."

Ethan paid—insisted on paying despite Sophia's protests—and they bundled up and headed outside.

The snow was incredible. It must have accumulated six inches in the two hours they'd been inside, and it was still falling heavily. The wind had picked up, creating drifts against buildings and cars. Ethan's truck was nearly buried.

"Holy shit," Ethan muttered, brushing snow off the windshield.

"This is bad."

"Yeah." He looked around. "We should get back to the hotel. Roads are going to be terrible."

They climbed in and Ethan started driving. The truck's four-wheel drive helped, but the roads were still treacherous. They crept through downtown at maybe ten miles per hour, visibility almost zero.

Sophia's phone buzzed. Text from Coach Martinez: *Tournament postponed until further notice. Blizzard warning upgraded. Stay where you are until it passes.*

She showed Ethan. He nodded grimly. "Okay. Change of plans. We're staying put tonight."

"Where?"

"My hotel. It's closer than your team hotel. And honestly, I don't think we should be driving anywhere else tonight."

"Ethan—"

"I'll get you your own room if you want. But I think we should stay together. What if something happens?"

He had a point. The storm was getting dangerous. And the thought of being alone in some hotel room while he was in a different one felt wrong.

"Okay," she said. "We'll stay at your hotel."

"Same room or different rooms?"

She should say different rooms. She should be responsible. But when she looked at him—at his worried face lit by the dashboard lights—she couldn't.

"Same room," she said quietly.

Something shifted in his expression. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. I don't want to be alone tonight."

"Okay. Same room."

They drove the last few blocks to the Holiday Inn in tense silence. The parking lot was nearly empty—most people had the sense not to be out in this weather. Ethan parked close to the entrance and they ran inside, snow immediately soaking through their clothes.

The lobby was warm and bright. The desk clerk looked up in surprise.

"You folks just get in?"

"Yeah," Ethan said. "Is the hotel fully booked?"

"Not even close. Storm scared everyone away. You need a room?"

"I have one. Room 247. But—" He glanced at Sophia. "Can I extend it for another night?"

"Sure thing." The clerk processed it quickly. "You two are the only guests on that floor. Everyone else checked out this afternoon when they saw the forecast."

They took the elevator to the second floor. The hallway was empty and eerily quiet. Ethan unlocked room 247 and they stepped inside.

It was a standard hotel room: two double beds, a TV, a bathroom, a window overlooking the parking lot. Nothing special. But something about being here—in this room, alone together, with the storm raging outside—made Sophia's heart race.

"I can take the couch," Ethan said, gesturing to the small loveseat by the window.

"There is no couch. That's a loveseat. You won't fit."

"Then I'll take the floor."

"Ethan. There are two beds. Just—we'll each take a bed."

He looked relieved. "Okay. Yeah. That works."

They stood awkwardly for a moment. Then Sophia said, "I should text my coach. Let her know where I am."

"Good idea. I should text my parents too."

They both pulled out their phones. Sophia texted Coach Martinez: *At hotel near the Alerus Center. Safe. Will wait out the storm.*

She didn't mention which hotel. Or that Ethan was with her.

Ethan was texting his parents, his face tense. When he finished, he tossed his phone on the bed. "My dad is pissed. Wanted to know why I'm not home yet."

"What did you tell him?"

"That I drove a friend to a tournament and got stuck in the storm. He's calling me in a minute. I should—" He gestured to the bathroom. "I'll take it in there. So you don't have to hear."

"Okay."

His phone rang almost immediately. He grabbed it and went into the bathroom, closing the door. Through the thin walls, Sophia could hear his voice—muffled but clearly arguing.

She sat on one of the beds and stared out the window. The storm was intensifying, snow falling so heavily she could barely see the parking lot below. They were stuck here. Maybe for the night. Maybe longer.

Stuck together.

In a hotel room.

With one night before he left forever.

The bathroom door opened. Ethan came out, his face pale and his jaw tight. "My dad is—he's really angry. He figured out where I am. Or who I'm with. I don't know how, but he knows."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "What did he say?"

"That I need to come home immediately. That the storm isn't an excuse. That I'm jeopardizing everything for—" He broke off, looking away.

"For what?"

"For you. He said I'm jeopardizing everything for you."

The words hung in the air between them, heavy and sharp.

"Maybe he's right," Sophia whispered.

Ethan's head snapped up. "What?"

"Maybe he's right. Maybe you should try to drive back tonight. Before this gets worse."

"Sophia, I can't drive in this. It's not safe."

"Then maybe I shouldn't have let you drive me in the first place. Maybe this whole thing was a mistake."

He crossed the room in three steps, grabbing her shoulders. "Hey. Look at me. This is not a mistake. Do you hear me? Being here with you is not a mistake."

"But your dad—"

"I don't care what my dad thinks. I'm eighteen. I made this choice. And I don't regret it." His eyes were fierce, desperate. "Do you regret it?"

She wanted to say yes. Wanted to say they should have been responsible, should have listened to the storm warnings, should have taken the safe path.

But when she looked at him—at his face inches from hers, at his hands on her shoulders, at the way he was looking at her like she was the only thing that mattered—she couldn't lie.

"No," she said. "I don't regret it."

"Good. Then stop trying to protect me from my own choices. I chose this. I choose you. And whatever consequences come from that, I'll deal with them."

He let go of her shoulders and stepped back, running a hand through his hair. He looked exhausted, wrung out from the argument with his father.

Sophia stood and went to him, wrapping her arms around his waist. He stiffened for a second, then melted into her, his face pressing into her hair.

"I'm sorry," she murmured.

"For what?"

"For making this harder. For being the reason your dad is angry."

"You're not the reason. His expectations are the reason. His need for control is the reason. You're just—" He pulled back to look at her. "You're the best thing that's happened to me in years. Don't apologize for that."

Her eyes stung. "What are we doing, Ethan?"

"I don't know. Surviving? Trying to carve out something that's ours?"

"Is it working?"

He smiled tiredly. "Ask me tomorrow."

They stood there holding each other, listening to the storm howl outside. And Sophia thought: this is it. This is the moment everything could change. They were alone, together, with nowhere to go and nothing to do but be present with each other.

It was terrifying.

It was perfect.

"We should sleep," Ethan said finally. "You have semifinals tomorrow. Maybe."

"Maybe," she agreed.

They separated reluctantly. Sophia grabbed her bag and went to the bathroom to change. When she came out in sweatpants and a t-shirt, Ethan had changed too—athletic shorts and a worn hockey t-shirt.

They climbed into their separate beds, turned off the lights. The room fell into darkness except for the faint glow from the parking lot lights reflecting off the snow.

"Ethan?" Sophia said into the dark.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For driving me. For being here. For choosing this."

"Thank you for letting me."

They lay in silence, listening to the wind. Sophia couldn't sleep. Her mind was too loud, too full of thoughts and worries and the awareness that he was right there, ten feet away, and tomorrow they'd have one more day together before everything fell apart.

"Sophia?" Ethan's voice was quiet.

"Yeah?"

"I'm glad we're here. Even with the storm. Even with my dad being pissed. I'm glad."

"Me too."

More silence. Then, so quiet she almost missed it: "Good night."

"Good night."

She closed her eyes and tried to sleep, but her heart was racing too fast, her mind spinning too quickly. Outside, the storm raged on, burying North Dakota under feet of snow.

And inside room 247, two teenagers lay awake in the dark, not sleeping, just existing in the same space, together and separate, knowing that tomorrow everything would change again.

Knowing that the storm outside was nothing compared to the storm waiting for them when they got home.

But for tonight—for right now—they had this.

And somehow, impossibly, it was enough.
