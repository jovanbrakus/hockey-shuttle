# CHAPTER 4: THE AFTERMATH

## JANUARY 7, JUNIOR YEAR

The morning was aggressively bright.

Sophia woke to sunlight streaming through the hotel window, blinding after two days of gray storm. She squinted against it, disoriented, until memory flooded back: the blizzard, the confession, falling asleep in Ethan's arms.

She turned her head. He was already awake, propped on one elbow, watching her.

"Hey," he said softly.

"Hey." Her voice was scratchy. "How long have you been up?"

"Hour maybe. Didn't want to wake you."

"What time is it?"

"Six-thirty."

Early. But also late. Because today was the day. Today he left.

Sophia sat up, pushing hair out of her face. Through the window, she could see the parking lot—or where the parking lot had been. Everything was buried under feet of pristine white snow. But the sky was clear, painfully blue, and she could hear the distant rumble of snowplows.

"Roads are opening," Ethan said, following her gaze. "I checked the highway status. They've been plowing all night. Should be clear by noon."

"What about the tournament?"

"Check your phone."

She grabbed it from the nightstand. Email from Coach Martinez, sent at 5:47 AM: *Finals rescheduled for 9:00 AM this morning. Alerus Center plowed and open. Be there by 8:30 for warmup.*

Sophia's stomach dropped. "I have two hours."

"Better get ready then."

She looked at him—at his tired eyes and messy hair and the way he was trying to smile like everything was fine. "Come with me. To watch."

"I was planning on it."

"No, I mean—stay with me. After. Help me pack. We'll drive back together."

"Sophia—"

"I know you have to leave tonight. I know. But let's—let's have the morning. The afternoon. A few more hours. Please."

He reached for her hand. "Yeah. Okay. Of course."

They got ready quickly—showering separately, dressing in silence. Sophia put on her badminton gear, braided her hair tight. Ethan wore jeans and his hockey jacket, the Winnipeg Falcons logo across the back. They looked like who they were: two athletes, two kids who'd built their identities around being good at their sports.

But they were also something else now. Something harder to define.

They checked out of the hotel—Ethan paid, ignoring Sophia's protests—and drove carefully through Grand Forks to the Alerus Center. The roads were plowed but still treacherous, ice hiding under fresh snow. Everything looked different in the bright morning light: beautiful and hostile at once.

The parking lot was fuller than expected. Apparently everyone had been eager to finish this tournament and get home. Sophia grabbed her bag from the back seat.

"I'll come in with you," Ethan said.

"You sure? My team is going to ask questions."

"Let them ask."

They walked into the arena together. Inside, it was chaos—players warming up, coaches shouting, parents in the stands. Sophia spotted Coach Martinez immediately. Her coach saw her, saw Ethan, and her expression flickered with something between concern and resignation.

"Sophia," she called, walking over. "You're here. Good."

"Sorry about yesterday. The storm—"

"I know. Everyone got stuck." Coach Martinez glanced at Ethan. "This is your friend? The one who drove you?"

"Ethan Price," he said, extending his hand. "Nice to meet you."

Coach Martinez shook it, studying him. "Hockey player?"

"Yes ma'am."

"You're the one going to prep school. In Michigan."

"Yes ma'am."

"When do you leave?"

"Tonight."

Coach Martinez looked between them, and Sophia saw understanding dawn in her eyes. "I see. Well." She turned to Sophia. "Finals are in thirty minutes. You're playing against the girl from Ontario you beat yesterday. She's good. You need to be better. Understood?"

"Yes Coach."

"Good. Go warm up."

Sophia nodded and headed toward the practice courts. Maya found her immediately, pulling her aside.

"Oh my God," Maya hissed. "You were with him the whole time? In the hotel?"

"Yeah."

"Did you—" She made a vague gesture that somehow conveyed everything.

"No. We just—we talked. And slept. Like, actually slept."

Maya looked disappointed. "That's so wholesome."

"It was perfect," Sophia said, and meant it.

She warmed up mechanically, her body knowing what to do even while her mind was elsewhere. In the stands, she could see Ethan sitting in the same back corner he'd chosen yesterday. Anonymous. Watching.

At nine o'clock, the official called her to court three for finals.

The match was brutal.

Her opponent was a girl named Rachel Liu, seventeen, from Toronto. They'd played before—Rachel had beaten Sophia at regionals last spring. She was fast, technical, and completely unshakeable.

First game: Sophia lost 21-16. She was distracted, emotional, kept missing shots she should have made.

Between games, Coach Martinez came to her bench. "Where are you right now?"

"What?"

"Your body is on this court. Your mind is somewhere else. Where?"

Sophia glanced at the stands, at Ethan. Coach Martinez followed her gaze.

"I see." Her coach's voice softened. "Look. I don't know your whole situation. But right now, you have twenty minutes left to prove you belong at nationals. You can fall apart after. But right now? Play. For yourself. Show everyone—including him—who you are when you're at your best."

Something in her words struck home. Sophia nodded. "Okay."

Second game: She played with desperate focus, channeling all her fear and love and confusion into each shot. She won 21-16.

Third game: Everything narrowed to the shuttlecock, the court, her body moving with precision she didn't know she possessed. Rachel was good. But Sophia was better today. She won 21-17.

National silver medalist for the third consecutive year.

When the final point landed, Sophia collapsed to her knees, gasping. Not from exhaustion—from relief. She'd done it. Despite everything, she'd won.

She looked up at the stands. Ethan was on his feet, clapping hard, his face split in a huge grin. And seeing him there—proud of her, happy for her—made everything worth it. Every risk, every choice, every consequence coming their way.

She'd chosen him, and she'd still won.

The medal ceremony was quick—gold to Rachel, silver to Sophia, bronze to two other players. Photos were taken, hands were shaken, congratulations exchanged. And then it was over.

Coach Martinez pulled her aside. "I'm proud of you. That was a hell of a match."

"Thanks Coach."

"Your parents are driving down tonight to pick you up. They called this morning."

Sophia's stomach plummeted. "What?"

"They said they wanted to drive you home themselves. They'll be here around three."

"But I—I have a ride—"

"I know. I told them. They said to send your friend home and wait for them." Coach Martinez's expression was sympathetic. "I'm sorry. I tried to tell them you were fine, but they insisted."

Sophia felt panic rising in her throat. Her parents. Driving six hours to pick her up. Because they didn't trust her. Because they knew about Ethan.

"When did they call?"

"Six this morning. They were—they seemed upset."

Upset. That was putting it mildly.

"Okay," Sophia said, trying to keep her voice steady. "Okay. Thanks for telling me."

She found Ethan waiting outside the locker room. One look at her face and his smile vanished.

"What's wrong?"

"My parents are driving here to pick me up. They'll be here at three."

He went pale. "They know."

"They must. Coach said they sounded upset."

"So we have—" He checked his watch. "Five hours."

"Yeah."

They looked at each other, the weight of it settling between them. Five hours. Then her parents would arrive. Then he'd have to drive back to Winnipeg alone, pack, and leave for Michigan tonight.

This was it. The end of their three days.

"Come on," Ethan said, taking her hand. "Let's go."

---

They drove out of Grand Forks with no real destination. Just driving, putting distance between themselves and the Alerus Center, buying time. The highways were clear now, bright sun glinting off endless white fields.

Sophia kept checking her phone. No calls yet. But they were coming.

"Where do you want to go?" Ethan asked.

"Anywhere. Nowhere. I don't care."

He took a random exit, drove into a small North Dakota town she didn't catch the name of. They found a diner, got coffee and pie neither of them wanted. Sat in a corner booth, holding hands across the table.

"We should talk about logistics," Ethan said. "How we'll stay in touch."

"Your dad took your phone."

"He took that phone. I'll get a burner. Something he doesn't know about."

"That's—that's a lot of work. And risk."

"I don't care. I need to talk to you. I can't go ten weeks without hearing your voice."

Sophia's throat was tight. "What if you get caught?"

"Then I get caught. And I deal with it." He squeezed her hand. "I'm going to call you. Text you. As much as I can. And spring break—I'm coming home. I don't care what my parents say."

"Ethan—"

"I know it sounds impossible. But I'm not giving up on this. On us. Unless—" He paused, suddenly uncertain. "Unless you want to. If this is too hard, if you'd rather just—end it clean—"

"No," she said immediately. "No. I don't want that."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. I love you. That doesn't change just because you're leaving."

He lifted her hand to his lips, kissed her knuckles. "I love you too. So much it scares me."

They sat in silence, coffee going cold, pie untouched. Outside, normal people went about their normal day. And Sophia felt the surreal disconnect of heartbreak happening in public, in a diner, on a sunny afternoon.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her mother: *We're two hours away. Be ready.*

She showed Ethan. He nodded, jaw tight. "We should head back."

"Not yet. Please. A little longer."

"Sophia, if we're not there when they arrive—"

"I know. I know. Just—" Her voice cracked. "Just five more minutes."

He got up, slid into her side of the booth, and pulled her against him. She buried her face in his shoulder, breathing him in—soap and coffee and something essentially him.

"This isn't the end," he murmured into her hair. "This is just—intermission. We'll figure out the second act."

"What if there isn't a second act?"

"There will be. I promise."

She wanted to believe him. Wanted to believe love was enough, that determination could overcome distance and parental disapproval and all the practical reasons this wouldn't work.

But sitting in that diner, wrapped in his arms, counting down minutes until separation, belief felt very far away.

---

They drove back to Grand Forks in heavy silence. The GPS said they'd arrive at 2:47—thirteen minutes before her parents. Barely enough time.

The Alerus Center parking lot was nearly empty now, tournament over, everyone gone home. Ethan parked in the same corner he'd used yesterday. Neither of them moved to get out.

"I don't know how to say goodbye," Sophia said.

"Then don't. Say 'see you later.'"

"That feels like lying."

"It's not lying. It's hope."

She turned to look at him. His face was pale, his eyes bright with unshed tears. He was holding it together through sheer force of will.

"Spring break," he said. "Ten weeks. I'll come back."

"Okay."

"And I'll call you. All the time. You'll get sick of me."

"Impossible."

He smiled, watery. "I'm going to miss you so much."

"I'm going to miss you too."

They kissed then—long and desperate and full of all the things they couldn't say. When they broke apart, they were both crying.

"I should go," Sophia whispered. "Before they get here."

"Yeah. Okay."

She grabbed her bag from the back seat, opened the door. The cold air hit her like a slap. She stood in the parking lot, looking back at him through the open door.

"Ethan?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For driving me. For this weekend. For—everything."

"Thank you for letting me. For choosing me."

"Always."

She closed the door and walked toward the arena entrance. Halfway there, she turned back. He was still sitting in his truck, watching her. She raised her hand in a small wave.

He waved back.

Then she forced herself to turn around and keep walking. Into the arena, through the empty halls, to the front entrance where she'd wait for her parents.

She didn't let herself look back again.

---

Her parents' car pulled up at exactly three o'clock.

Sophia watched through the glass doors as they parked, got out, walked toward the entrance. Her father looked tired, her mother looked furious. This was going to be bad.

They came inside. Her mother saw her and stopped short.

"Sophia," she said. Just her name. But the weight of disappointment in it was crushing.

"Hi Mom. Hi Dad."

Her father took her bag. "Is he still here? The boy?"

"No. He left."

A lie. Ethan was still in the parking lot, probably watching this unfold. But she couldn't—she couldn't let them confront him. Couldn't let this get worse.

"Good," her mother said tightly. "Let's go."

They walked to the car in silence. Sophia climbed in the back seat, looked out the window. And there—in the far corner of the lot—Ethan's truck. Still parked. Still waiting.

Her father started driving, heading toward the highway. As they passed Ethan's truck, Sophia looked. He was watching, his face visible through the windshield.

Their eyes met for one last second.

Then they were past, pulling onto the highway, and he was gone.

---

The drive back to Winnipeg was six hours of silence.

Her parents didn't yell. Didn't lecture. Didn't say anything at all. Just drove, the radio off, the tension suffocating.

Finally, as they crossed into Manitoba, her mother spoke.

"You lied to us."

"I know."

"You rejected MIT and you lied about who drove you and you spent the weekend with a boy whose family we don't even know."

"I know."

"Do you have any idea how worried we were? When the storm hit and we couldn't reach you? When your coach said you'd driven down with some boy?"

"I'm sorry."

Her mother turned around in her seat, eyes blazing. "Sorry isn't enough. You've been making terrible choices, Sophia. Rejecting MIT. Spending all your time with this boy. And for what? So you can throw away your future?"

"I'm not throwing away my future."

"Then what do you call it? You had a guarantee. You had everything figured out. And you threw it away for—for what? Teenage romance?"

"For myself," Sophia said, voice shaking. "I threw it away for myself. Because I didn't want his father's bribe."

Silence.

Her mother stared at her. "What?"

Too late, Sophia realized her mistake. She'd said too much.

"What bribe?" her father asked from the driver's seat.

There was no taking it back now. "Robert Price offered me MIT. In October. Came to our house with a letter. He said it was all arranged, I just had to accept. But it wasn't—it wasn't real. It was a bribe to stay away from Ethan."

Her parents exchanged a look. Her mother turned back around, facing forward. Long silence.

Finally her father said, "We know."

Sophia's world tilted. "What?"

"We know," her mother repeated. "Robert called us in November. After you rejected it. He told us what he'd offered and that you'd turned it down. He wanted to know if we could convince you to reconsider."

"You knew?" Sophia's voice was rising. "You knew he tried to bribe me and you didn't tell me?"

"Because we agreed with him," her mother said. "We thought MIT was the right choice. We thought you were being stubborn. We were going to talk to you about it, but then you rejected it anyway, and we realized—" She stopped.

"Realized what?"

"Realized you'd chosen that boy over your future. Over us."

The accusation hung in the air, ugly and impossible to refute. Because it was partly true. She had chosen Ethan. Not over her future—but as part of her future. As part of who she wanted to be.

"I didn't choose him over you," Sophia said quietly. "I chose honesty over manipulation. I chose making my own decisions over letting everyone else decide for me. And yes, part of that decision included Ethan. Because I love him."

Her mother flinched. "You're seventeen. You don't know what love is."

"Maybe I don't. But I know what this is. And it's real. Even if it's hard. Even if everyone thinks it's a mistake."

No one responded. They drove on in silence.

As they pulled into Winnipeg—familiar streets, familiar landscape—Sophia felt exhaustion settle over her like a weight. She was so tired. Tired of fighting, tired of defending herself, tired of being caught between what everyone wanted for her and what she wanted for herself.

They pulled into her driveway at nine-thirty PM. Dark, cold, the house lit from within. Home. Except it didn't feel like home anymore. It felt like a place she was trapped.

"Go inside," her mother said. "We'll talk more tomorrow."

Sophia grabbed her bag and went in. Her parents followed, but she went straight upstairs to her room, closed the door, and collapsed on her bed.

Her phone buzzed immediately. Text from Maya: *Are you okay?? Your parents looked PISSED when they picked you up.*

Sophia typed back: *I'm alive. Barely. Talk tomorrow.*

Then, text from unknown number: *It's me. Just got home. About to leave for Michigan. I love you. This isn't over.*

Ethan. He'd gotten a burner phone already.

She saved the number, labeled it just "E" in case her parents looked, and typed back: *I love you too. Be safe. Text me when you get there.*

*I will. Wait for me.*

*Always.*

She set her phone down and stared at her ceiling. Somewhere, Ethan was packing. Saying goodbye to his parents—or not saying goodbye, just leaving. Driving through the night to Michigan. To prep school. To the life his father had planned.

And she was here. Alone. Her parents furious, her future uncertain, her heart broken but still beating.

Silver medal on her desk.

Torn MIT letter in her trash.

"E" saved in her phone.

Three days that had changed everything.

She closed her eyes and let herself cry. For what she'd chosen, what she'd lost, what she'd almost had. For the impossibility of teenage love against the world. For the boy driving away from her right now, getting farther with every passing second.

Her phone buzzed again. Voice message.

She opened it. Ethan's voice, rough and quiet: "I found a way to send this. I'll find more ways. Every day. I promise. Wait for me, Sophia. Please wait for me."

She listened to it three times before sleep finally claimed her.

---

Sophia woke to shouting.

Not in her room—downstairs. Her parents' voices, raised in argument. And another voice, deeper. Male.

She checked her phone: 7:12 AM. Sunday morning.

Throwing on a hoodie, she crept to the top of the stairs, listening.

"—cannot keep her from him—" her father was saying.

"She's seventeen! She lives in our house! We can absolutely—" her mother, furious.

Then the third voice, and Sophia's blood ran cold. "I understand your concern, believe me. But this has to stop. For both their sakes."

Robert Price.

He was here. In her house. Talking about her.

Sophia came down the stairs, fury overriding caution. All three adults turned as she appeared in the living room doorway.

"What are you doing here?" she asked Robert.

"Sophia—" her mother started.

"No. What is he doing here?" She looked at Robert. "You don't get to show up at my house. You don't get to talk about me like I'm not here."

Robert stood, tall and imposing in his suit even on a Sunday morning. "Sophia. I came to apologize."

That stopped her. "What?"

"For the MIT situation. For going behind your back. For—" He paused, looking genuinely uncomfortable. "For trying to bribe you away from my son."

Silence.

"I thought I was helping," he continued. "I thought I was giving you an opportunity and giving Ethan space to focus. But I see now that I was trying to control a situation I had no right to control. And I'm sorry."

Sophia stared at him. This was—this was not what she'd expected.

"However," Robert continued, and there it was, "I need you to understand something. Ethan is on a very specific path. Hockey. College. NHL. That path requires incredible focus and dedication. And right now, he's distracted."

"I'm not a distraction."

"I didn't mean—" He sighed. "You're important to him. I can see that. But he's eighteen years old. He has a future that could set him up for life. And I can't watch him throw that away."

"He's not throwing anything away."

"He spent this weekend driving you to North Dakota instead of preparing for prep school. He's fighting with me constantly about you. He's talking about—" Robert stopped himself.

"About what?" Sophia pressed.

"About quitting hockey."

The words fell like a bomb. Sophia's breath caught.

"He mentioned it once," Robert said, voice tight. "Said he wasn't sure he wanted to keep playing. And I know—I know that's because of you. Because you're making him question everything."

"No," Sophia said. "I'm not making him question anything. He's questioning it himself. Because maybe, for the first time in his life, he's thinking about what he wants instead of what you want."

Robert's jaw tightened. "What I want is for my son to have every opportunity. Every advantage. What do you want for him?"

"I want him to be happy."

"Happy doesn't pay bills. Happy doesn't secure a future."

"Maybe his future isn't what you think it is."

They stared at each other, the room crackling with tension. Sophia's parents watched, uncertain whether to intervene.

Finally Robert said, "He left for Michigan last night. He'll be there for ten weeks before spring break. I'm asking you—respectfully—to let him focus. Don't call, don't text, don't make this harder than it needs to be. Give him space to figure out who he is without—"

"Without me," Sophia finished.

"Without distraction. And then, if in ten weeks he still wants to be with you, we'll revisit this conversation. But please. Give him this time."

Sophia felt tears burning her eyes. "Did he ask you to say this? Does he want space?"

"No. He doesn't. But I'm asking as his father. Please."

She looked at her parents, standing in their living room, united with Robert Price in thinking they knew what was best. Three adults against one seventeen-year-old girl.

"No," she said.

Robert blinked. "What?"

"No. I'm not giving up on him. If he wants space, he can tell me himself. But I'm not going to disappear because you're scared he'll choose differently than you planned." She took a breath, steadying herself. "I love him. And he loves me. And I know you think that's childish or naive or whatever. But it's real. And I'm not walking away just because it's inconvenient for you."

"Sophia—" her mother started.

"No," Sophia said again, louder. "I'm done. I'm done letting everyone else make my choices. I rejected MIT. I chose to go to North Dakota. I chose Ethan. And I'm choosing to wait for him. You can all be mad about it. You can ground me or monitor my phone or whatever. But you can't make me stop caring about him."

She turned and walked back upstairs, ignoring her mother calling her name. In her room, she closed the door and leaned against it, shaking.

Her phone buzzed. Text from E: *Just got to Michigan. 8 hour drive. I'm exhausted. Miss you already.*

She typed back: *Your dad is at my house. Asking me to give you space.*

Three dots appeared immediately. Then: *WHAT*

*He said you mentioned quitting hockey. Said I'm distracting you.*

*I'm going to kill him*

*Don't. Just—tell me the truth. Do you want space?*

Long pause. Then: *No. I want the opposite of space. I want to call you every day. I want to count down days until spring break. I want to figure out how to make this work.*

*Okay. Then we do that.*

*You're sure? Even if everyone thinks it's wrong?*

*Especially because everyone thinks it's wrong. We don't let them decide.*

*I love you*

*I love you too*

She set her phone down and looked around her room. Silver medal gleaming. Schedule of upcoming tournaments. College brochures scattered across her desk.

Her life, waiting to be lived.

On her terms.

Her door opened without a knock. Her mother stood in the doorway, face carefully controlled.

"Robert left," she said. "Your father drove him out."

"Good."

"Sophia, we need to talk—"

"Later. Please. I need—I need a minute."

Her mother nodded slowly. "Okay. Later." She started to leave, then paused. "That match yesterday. Coach Martinez emailed. She said you played brilliantly. Said she's never seen you fight that hard."

"I had a lot to fight for."

Her mother's expression softened, just a fraction. "I know you think we don't understand. But we're just—we're scared for you. We don't want to see you get hurt."

"I know. But this is my hurt to risk."

"That doesn't make it easier to watch."

"I know. I'm sorry."

Her mother sighed and closed the door, leaving Sophia alone.

Phone buzzed again. Voice message from E.

She opened it: "Hey. So I'm here. Prep school. It's—it's really intense. But I have a room to myself, and I already figured out the wifi password, so that's good. I'm going to call you tonight after practice. I know it's only been twelve hours, but I already—" His voice cracked. "I already miss you so much. This is going to be the longest ten weeks of my life. But I'll make it through. We'll make it through. Because you're waiting, and I'm coming back. I promise. I love you. Talk soon."

Sophia listened to it three times, memorizing every word, every inflection.

Ten weeks.

Seventy days.

And then spring break.

And then—what? More fighting? More disapproval? More stolen moments between the lives everyone else wanted them to live?

She didn't know.

But she knew this: she'd chosen him, and he'd chosen her, and that was enough to start with.

Everything else—college, hockey, their families, the future—would have to wait.

For now, they had secret phone calls and countdown clocks and the memory of three days in a storm that had changed everything.

Sophia opened her journal and started writing.

*January 7. He left. I stayed. And somehow, even though we're apart, I feel like we're more together than we've ever been. Because we chose this. The hard way. The uncertain way. The way that might not work.*

*But we chose.*

*And that has to count for something.*

She set down her pen and looked out the window. Bright winter sun on white snow. The world frozen and beautiful and impossible.

Somewhere in Michigan, Ethan was starting his new life.

And here in Winnipeg, she was starting hers.

Same world. Different places.

But connected by choice, by love, by the impossible promise: wait for me.

She would wait.

And when spring break came—when he came back—they'd figure out the rest together.

For now, that was enough.

It had to be.

**EPISODE 5 ENDS**

Three days that changed everything. A storm that trapped them together. Confessions and promises and choosing each other despite impossible odds. And now: separation. Distance. Ten weeks of wondering if love is enough.

The midseason climax delivered. Now comes the aftermath—episodes 6 through 10 will test whether their choice can survive reality.

Can they make it through ten weeks apart?

Can they survive their parents' opposition?

Can teenage love last when everything is working against it?

Episode 6 will begin to answer these questions.

But for now, they have this: the memory of three perfect, impossible days when they chose each other completely.

And the devastating knowledge that choosing each other meant everything would change.

*Spring break countdown: 70 days*

*Next episode: "Distance"*
