# CHAPTER 3: THE STORM

## JANUARY 6, JUNIOR YEAR

Sophia woke up to sunlight trying to murder her eyeballs.

She groaned and rolled over, burying her face in the pillow. Why was it so bright? Oh. Right. Snow. Mountains of it. And sun bouncing off snow was basically nature's spotlight.

Grand Forks. Hotel room. Storm.

Ethan.

She turned her head. The other bed was empty, sheets tangled like someone had fought them all night. Ethan's voice came from the bathroom, muffled but tense.

"—I understand that, but I physically cannot drive in this. Have you looked outside?"

Pause.

"I don't care if you're disappointed. I'm not risking our lives to get home twelve hours earlier."

His father. Had to be. Sophia's stomach clenched. She grabbed her phone: eighteen missed calls, forty-two texts, voicemails she didn't want to hear.

"Mom, I—yes, I know. Yes. I will. When the roads are clear." Another pause, longer. "I don't—that's not—" His voice cracked. "Can we please not do this right now?"

Sophia got out of bed and went to the window. The parking lot had vanished. Cars were shapeless mounds under three feet of snow. Ethan's truck was completely buried. And it was still snowing—heavy, violent, wind-driven sheets of white.

They weren't going anywhere. Maybe not for days.

The bathroom door opened. Ethan emerged, phone in hand, face pale and exhausted. When he saw her at the window, he stopped.

"How bad?" he asked.

She gestured at the window. "Your truck is basically an igloo now."

He crossed to stand beside her. "Jesus."

"Your parents?"

"Dad first. Then Mom. They're—" He scrubbed a hand over his face. "They're beyond angry. They've hit some new level I didn't know existed."

"What did they say?"

"My dad said if I don't come home the second the roads clear, I'm cut off. No prep school. No college money. Nothing."

"He's bluffing."

"Maybe. Maybe not. He sounded..." Ethan shook his head. "I've never heard him like that. Like I'd betrayed him personally."

"You chose something for yourself. That's not betrayal."

"To him it is." He turned away from the window, pacing the small room. "He said—he said you're ruining me. That you're a distraction from my future."

The word hit like a slap. "Maybe I am."

"Don't." His voice went sharp. "Don't you dare say that."

"But what if he's right? What if being with me is—"

"Is what? Making me think for myself? Making me question whether I want to spend my whole life doing what he planned?" Ethan stopped pacing, faced her. "Then good. I want to be ruined if his version is the only option."

"Ethan—"

"No. I'm serious. I'm eighteen years old and I've never made a real choice until this week. Everything—hockey, school, friends, girlfr—" He caught himself. "Everything was what made sense for 'the trajectory.' His word, not mine."

"And now?"

"Now I'm in a hotel room in North Dakota, snowed in with the girl I love, while my father threatens to destroy my future." He laughed, bitter and a little wild. "And you know what? I'm happier than I've been in years."

"You don't look happy."

"I'm terrified. But I'm also... free? For the first time ever, I'm doing something because I want to, not because it's expected." He crossed to her, took her hands. "I need to tell you something."

"Okay."

"It's about the MIT thing. I need you to know—"

"I know you didn't know about it. I know it wasn't your idea."

"That's not—" He took a breath. "I need to tell you that I understand. Why you almost took it. Why it was tempting."

"Ethan—"

"No, let me finish. My whole life, I've done what was expected because it was easier. Safer. It made everyone happy and proud and I never had to think too hard about what I actually wanted. So I get it. The appeal of having it all figured out."

"But you're doing it anyway. Prep school."

"Am I?" He met her eyes. "Am I really?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implication.

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying... what if I didn't go? What if I just... didn't get on that plane tomorrow?"

Sophia's breath caught. "Your parents would actually murder you."

"Maybe."

"Your future—"

"Would be uncertain. Yeah. Join the club." He squeezed her hands. "You tore up MIT for uncertainty. Why can't I do the same?"

"Because—because that's different."

"How?"

"I don't know, it just is." She pulled her hands free, needing space to think. "You can't throw away hockey because of me."

"See, that's where you're wrong. It wouldn't be because of you. It would be because of me. Because I don't want to play anymore."

The confession landed like thunder.

"You don't mean that."

"I do though." His voice was quiet now, certain. "I haven't wanted to play for at least a year. Maybe longer. I'm just good at it, so everyone assumes I love it. But I don't. I'm tired, Soph. Tired of being hit, tired of pressure, tired of my entire worth being tied to how well I can shoot a puck."

"So what would you do instead?"

"I don't know. That's the terrifying part. But also the exciting part?" He sat on the bed, suddenly looking very young. "I could do anything. Study astrophysics without hockey taking all my time. Take art classes. Travel. Figure out who I am when I'm not Ethan Price, hockey star."

Sophia sat beside him. "That's a huge decision."

"Yeah."

"Like, life-changing huge."

"Yeah."

"You shouldn't make it just because we're stuck in a hotel room and you're emotional."

He laughed. "When else would I make it? When I'm calm and rational and surrounded by people telling me to stay the course?"

"Good point."

They sat in silence for a moment. Outside, the storm howled like something alive and angry.

"I need to tell you something," Sophia said suddenly.

"Okay."

"About MIT. About why I really rejected it."

"You told me. It was a bribe."

"That's part of it. But also..." She gathered her courage. "I was scared. Of committing to engineering. Of being locked into something at seventeen."

"That's reasonable—"

"I'm not finished." She turned to face him fully. "I was also scared of losing you. Of choosing the safe path and watching you disappear into your father's plan and wondering what if for the rest of my life."

"Soph—"

"I know we've only been together a few months. I know we're young. I know everyone thinks this is just teenage drama that won't matter in five years. But Ethan, I—" Her voice cracked. "I've been in love with you since I was nine years old."

The words just came out. She hadn't planned to say them. Ethan went completely still.

"I mean—not like, romantic love. When we were nine. That would be weird. But something. You were—" God, why was this so hard? "You were my person. And when you left, it broke something. And when you came back—"

"Sophia—"

"Let me finish. When you came back, it was like I could breathe again. Which sounds dramatic but it's true. It's like I'd been holding my breath for eight years and didn't realize it until you were back and suddenly I could breathe."

She was talking too much. She always talked too much when she was nervous.

"You won't lose me."

"I'm losing you tomorrow. You're going to Michigan."

"Not if I don't get on the plane."

"You have to get on the plane."

"Why?"

"Because—" She stopped, frustrated. Why did he have to? Because it was expected? Because his parents demanded it? Those weren't good enough reasons anymore.

"See?" Ethan said softly. "You can't think of a real reason either."

"Your future—"

"Is mine to choose. Just like yours is yours to choose." He took her hands again. "What if we both just... chose ourselves? Chose uncertainty? Together?"

"That's terrifying."

"Completely."

"And probably stupid."

"Oh, definitely stupid."

"Our parents would never forgive us."

"Maybe they would. Eventually." He paused. "Or maybe they wouldn't. But we'd have to live with that."

Sophia looked at their joined hands. His were bigger, rougher from years of hockey. Hers fit inside them perfectly.

"Can I tell you something that might change everything?" she asked.

"More than what you just told me?"

"Maybe."

"Tell me."

She met his eyes. "I love you. Not just teenage love. Not just first love. The real thing. The kind that makes you reconsider everything you thought you knew about yourself."

"Sophia—"

"And I know that's a lot. I know we're seventeen—"

"Eighteen—"

"Whatever. I know we're young and this is crazy and we're probably making huge mistakes. But I need you to know that. That this isn't just rebellion or hormones or whatever. I love you. The real you. Not hockey star you. The you who wants to study stars and reads science fiction and makes playlists at 3 AM."

Ethan's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "I—" He stopped, took a breath. "I've been in love with you since the moment you walked into Spanish class. Maybe since we were nine, I don't know. Time feels weird with us."

"Right?"

"Like we're picking up where we left off, but also starting something entirely new."

"Exactly."

He leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers. "I love you too. The real thing. The terrifying, life-changing, make-stupid-decisions kind."

"Good." She pulled back just enough to see his face. "So what do we do about it?"

"Right now?"

"Right now."

He glanced at the window, at the storm still raging. "Right now, we're trapped in a hotel room in North Dakota. No one can get to us. No one can make us leave. We have..." He checked his phone. "At least twenty-four hours before roads might be clear."

"So?"

"So we have twenty-four hours to figure out what we actually want. Without anyone else's input."

"And what do you want? Right now, in this moment?"

He looked at her for a long moment, something shifting in his expression. "You. I want you. Is that—is that okay to say?"

Sophia's heart was suddenly hammering. "Yeah. It's okay."

"I don't mean—I'm not trying to pressure—"

"I know." She moved closer, close enough to feel his breath. "I want you too."

They looked at each other, the air between them electric. And then they were kissing—desperate, hungry, months of careful control finally breaking.

"Wait," Ethan gasped, pulling back. "Wait. We should—we should talk about this."

"We've been talking."

"I mean about—" He was flustered, face flushed. "I've never—"

"Me neither."

"So maybe we should—I don't know what I'm saying." He laughed, nervous. "This is going really well."

"Smooth talker," she teased, but her own heart was racing.

"I'm trying to do this right and I have no idea what I'm doing."

"Neither do I." She took his face in her hands. "But maybe that's okay? Maybe we figure it out together?"

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They kissed again, slower this time. Less desperate, more intentional. When they broke apart, Ethan stood, pulling her up with him.

"If we're doing this," he said, "we're doing it right."

"Define right."

"Not because we're scared. Not because we're running out of time. Because we want to. Because we choose to."

"I choose you," Sophia said simply.

"I choose you too."

[*Intimate scene - fade to emotional focus*]

When Sophia woke later—much later—wrapped in Ethan's arms with afternoon light filtering through the snow-covered window, her first thought was: *No regrets. That's what she kept thinking. No regrets. Even though her parents would kill her. No regrets. Even though this complicated everything. No regrets.*

Her second thought was: *Everything is different now*.

Ethan stirred beside her, pulling her closer. "You awake?"

"Yeah."

"You okay?"

Was she okay? She'd just changed everything. Crossed a line she couldn't uncross. Made a choice that would ripple forward through the rest of her life. But weirdly, she felt... fine? More than fine?

"Yeah," she said. "I'm okay. You?"

"More than okay."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I feel..." He paused, searching for words. "Free. Like I finally did something that was completely mine. Ours."

"No regrets?"

"Never. You?"

"Never."

They lay in comfortable silence, listening to the storm. It was starting to quiet—still snowing, but the violence had passed. Soon the roads would clear. Soon they'd have to face reality.

But not yet.

"What time is it?" Sophia asked.

Ethan checked his phone. "Four PM. Also, seventeen missed calls from my father."

"Twenty-three from my mother."

"We should probably let them know we're alive."

"Probably."

Neither moved.

"Five more minutes?" Ethan suggested.

"Five more minutes."

But five became ten, became an hour, became the rest of the afternoon tangled together in their bubble of stolen time. They talked about everything—childhood memories, dreams they'd never voiced, fears they'd never admitted. The conversation had a different quality now, deeper, like physical intimacy had unlocked emotional doors.

"Can I tell you something weird?" Ethan asked as the light faded toward evening.

"Always."

"I keep thinking about parallel universes. Like, in how many versions of reality do we end up here? In this room? In this moment?"

"Probably not many."

"Right? The odds were so against it. If my parents hadn't moved back to Winnipeg. If you'd taken MIT. If the storm had hit a day earlier or later. If, if, if."

"But it happened."

"It happened." He pressed his face into her hair. "We happened."

"Against all odds."

"The best things usually are."

They eventually got up, showered (separately, though the awareness of the other just beyond the door was its own kind of intimacy), dressed, and ventured out to find food. The hotel restaurant was surprisingly busy—other stranded travelers comparing storm stories.

They got a table by the window. The parking lot was still invisible under snow, but the wind had died. Tomorrow, plows would come. Tomorrow, the world would restart.

"You know what's funny?" Sophia said, picking at her salad.

"What?"

"Everyone's going to think we planned this. The storm. Getting stuck."

"We kind of did plan it."

"We planned the trip. We didn't plan—" She gestured vaguely.

"No. That just happened."

"Do you think it would have? Without the storm? If we'd just had a normal weekend?"

Ethan considered. "Honestly? Probably not. We would have been focused on your tournament, on getting back, on being responsible."

"So we needed the storm."

"We needed something to force us to stop running long enough to actually be together."

"Running from what?"

"Everything. Expectations. The future. Our parents. Ourselves."

"And now?"

"Now we face it all. But differently. Because we chose something. Finally."

Their phones buzzed simultaneously. Both checked.

"Tournament's back on," Sophia reported. "Nine AM tomorrow."

"Roads should be clear by noon," Ethan read from a weather update.

"So tomorrow we go back."

"Tomorrow I'm supposed to leave for Michigan."

"Are you going to?"

He was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know. Ask me tomorrow."

They finished dinner and walked back to their room. The hallway was still eerily empty. Inside 247, the beds were still rumpled, evidence of their afternoon everywhere.

"We should probably text our parents," Sophia said. "Let them know we're okay."

"Right."

They sat on one bed, composing messages. Sophia went simple: *Safe in Grand Forks. Roads still closed. Will head home when clear. Tournament tomorrow AM.*

Her mother's response was immediate: *This is unacceptable. We're coming to get you as soon as roads open.*

*Please don't. I need to finish the tournament.*

*This isn't about badminton anymore, Sophia.*

She showed Ethan. He showed her his: *If you're not home by tomorrow night, you're not my son anymore.*

"Jesus," Sophia breathed.

"Yeah."

"He doesn't mean that."

"He might." Ethan tossed his phone aside. "But you know what? I don't care. I'm tired of being held hostage by his disappointment."

"That's your father."

"That's a man who sees me as an investment. Not a son."

The bitterness in his voice was sharp enough to cut.

"Ethan—"

"Do you know what he said when I told him I got into Northwestern? For academics, not hockey?"

"What?"

"He said 'That's nice, but it doesn't matter. You're going for hockey.' Not congratulations. Not 'I'm proud of you.' Just dismissal of anything that wasn't his plan."

"That's awful."

"That's my life. Or was." He looked at her. "I'm not going to Michigan tomorrow."

"Ethan—"

"I'm not. I decided. I'll face whatever consequences come, but I'm not getting on that plane."

"Where will you go? If he cuts you off?"

"I'll figure it out. Get a job. Student loans. Stay with Jordan maybe, until I graduate." He took her hands. "I know it sounds insane. But I can't do it anymore. I can't live his life."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"If that's your choice, I support you. The same way you supported me tearing up MIT."

He kissed her, soft and grateful. "I love you."

"I love you too."

They got ready for bed—teeth brushed, faces washed, the domestic routine strangely intimate. Without discussion, they both climbed into the same bed. Sophia curled into his side, her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat.

"Whatever happens tomorrow," she said into the darkness, "I want you to know this was worth it. All of it."

"Even the consequences?"

"Especially the consequences. Because they mean we chose something real."

He pressed a kiss to her hair. "No regrets."

"No regrets."

Outside, snow continued to fall, gentler now. Inside, they held each other, knowing tomorrow would bring battles they might not win. But for tonight—for these stolen hours in room 247—they had chosen each other completely.

And that was everything.

That was enough.

More than enough—it was the beginning of who they really were.

---

Sophia woke at 3 AM to Ethan sitting up, breathing hard.

"Bad dream?" she asked, touching his back.

"Panic attack," he managed. "Sometimes—before big things—"

"What do you need?"

"Just—don't leave. Don't go anywhere."

"I'm right here."

She sat up, wrapping her arms around him from behind. His heart was racing, his whole body trembling. She'd never seen him this vulnerable, this unguarded.

"Breathe with me," she said. "In for four, hold for four, out for four."

They breathed together in the darkness, her counting softly, until his heartbeat slowed.

"Better?"

"Yeah. Sorry."

"Don't apologize. Ever. Not for this."

He turned to face her. "It happens sometimes. The pressure just—builds up and my body rebels."

"How long?"

"Years. Since I was maybe fourteen. Since hockey became everything."

"Do your parents know?"

"God, no. They'd see it as weakness. As proof I can't handle the pressure."

"It's not weakness."

"I know. Logically. But—"

"No. Listen to me." She took his face in her hands. "You've been carrying impossible pressure for years. The fact that you have panic attacks isn't weakness—it's your body trying to tell you something. That this isn't sustainable. That you need to choose differently."

"Like not going to Michigan."

"Like choosing your own path. Whatever that looks like."

He kissed her palm. "How are you so wise?"

"I read a lot of psychology books trying to figure out why I was so anxious all the time."

"And?"

"Turns out living for other people's approval is bad for your mental health. Who knew?"

He laughed, soft in the darkness. "Revolutionary discovery."

"Right?"

They lay back down, Sophia's head on his chest again. His heartbeat was steady now, calm.

"Thank you," he whispered.

"For what?"

"For seeing all of me. Even the panic attacks and uncertainty and mess. And not running."

"Where would I run? We're snowed in."

"You know what I mean."

She did. "You see all of me too. The anxiety and people-pleasing and need for control."

"I love all of you."

"Even the messy parts?"

"Especially those. That's the real you."

She smiled against his chest. "I love your messy parts too."

"Good. Because tomorrow's going to be really messy."

"Yeah."

"You ready for tomorrow?"

"God, no. You?"

"Not even a little bit."

"Cool. So we'll just be completely unprepared. Together."

"Together." He said it like it meant something bigger.

"Stop making that word sound romantic. We're talking about getting yelled at by our parents."

"I can make anything romantic. Watch: Detention. Parking tickets. Root canals."

"You're an idiot."

"Your idiot."

She smiled despite everything. "Yeah. Mine."

They fell asleep again like that, wrapped around each other, while outside the storm finally exhausted itself, leaving the world buried and new.

Tomorrow would bring consequences.

Tonight was theirs.
