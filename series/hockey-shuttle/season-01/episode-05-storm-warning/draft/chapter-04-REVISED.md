# CHAPTER 4: THE AFTERMATH

## JANUARY 7, JUNIOR YEAR

Morning came like an assault—aggressive sunlight bouncing off pristine snow.

Sophia woke to brightness so intense it hurt. She squinted, disoriented, then remembered: Grand Forks. Hotel room. Storm. Ethan.

Ethan.

She turned her head. He was already awake, propped on one elbow, watching her with an expression she couldn't read.

"Hey," he said softly.

"Hey." Her voice came out scratchy. "What time is it?"

"Six-thirty."

Early. But also late. Because today was the day. Today he was supposed to leave for Michigan. Today everything would fall apart or come together, and she didn't know which.

She sat up, pushing hair from her face. Through the window, she could see the parking lot—or what had been the parking lot. Everything was buried under mountains of snow. But the sky was offensively clear, painfully blue, and she could hear the distant rumble of plows.

"Roads are opening," Ethan said, following her gaze. "Highway should be clear by noon."

"Your flight—"

"Was supposed to be tonight at eight. From Winnipeg."

"That's..." She did quick mental math. "Six hours of driving, if roads are clear. You could make it."

"I could."

The word hung between them, loaded with everything they'd discussed last night.

"Are you going to?"

He sat up, scrubbed his hands over his face. "I don't know. I thought I knew, but now..." He looked at her. "What do you think I should do?"

"I can't answer that for you."

"I know. But if you could. If it was your choice."

Sophia pulled her knees to her chest, thinking. "I think... I think you should go."

His face fell. "You want me to leave?"

"No. God, no. But I think—I think if you don't go, you'll always wonder. What if you'd tried. What if you'd given it a chance. And your parents—"

"Will never forgive me either way."

"Maybe. But at least if you go, you're trying. You can always leave later if it's truly awful. But if you don't even try..."

"I'll be the kid who threw away everything for a girl."

"You're not throwing it away for me."

"I know. But that's how everyone will see it. How I might see it, someday, if things don't work out with us."

The possibility hurt to acknowledge, but it was real. They were eighteen. Statistics were against them.

"So go," she said. "Try. And if it's unbearable, leave. Come home. Figure out something else. But at least try."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You're right. I hate that you're right, but you are."

"I'm sorry."

"No. I needed to hear it." He reached for her hand. "Will you wait? While I'm gone? It's only ten weeks until spring break."

"You know I will."

"Even with the distance? Even with my parents trying to destroy this?"

"Especially then. I'm stubborn when people tell me I can't have something."

He smiled, the first real smile of the morning. "I love that about you."

"My stubbornness?"

"Your determination. Your refusal to be controlled."

"Learned from the best," she said, squeezing his hand. "You chose me over everything safe. Least I can do is choose you back."

Her phone buzzed. Email from Coach Martinez: *Finals rescheduled for 9:00 AM. Be there by 8:30 for warmup.*

"I have a match," Sophia said.

"I'll come watch."

"You don't have to—"

"Sophia. I drove you here to watch you play. I'm watching you play."

They got ready quickly, muscle memory from years of early morning practices. Sophia braided her hair tight, put on her competition clothes. Ethan wore jeans and his Winnipeg Falcons hoodie—no point hiding anymore.

The hotel breakfast was crowded with stranded travelers finally able to leave. They ate quickly, quietly, both lost in thought about what came next.

"After your match," Ethan said. "We should head back right away. The longer we wait—"

"The worse it gets. I know."

They drove carefully to the Alerus Center. The roads were plowed but still treacherous, ice hiding under fresh sand. The parking lot was fuller than expected—apparently everyone was eager to finish the tournament and get home.

Coach Martinez was waiting at the entrance.

"Sophia. You made it."

"Sorry about yesterday—"

"The entire tournament was cancelled yesterday. Everyone was stuck." Her coach's eyes moved to Ethan. "Mr. Price."

"Coach Martinez."

"You're the one who drove her."

"Yes ma'am."

"Through a blizzard."

"We drove down before the blizzard. Got stuck during it."

Coach Martinez studied them both, and Sophia could see her adding things up. The same hotel. The way they stood close together. The something that had changed between them.

"Your parents are worried sick," she said to Sophia.

"I texted them. They know I'm safe."

"Safe is relative." But her tone was gentle. "Go warm up. Finals in thirty minutes."

Sophia's opponent was the Ontario girl from yesterday—or was it the day before? Time felt elastic, distorted by the storm and everything that had happened in room 247.

The match was brutal. Sophia's body was exhausted, her mind scattered. She lost the first game 21-16, couldn't find her rhythm. Between games, she looked up at the stands. Ethan was in his usual spot, but he wasn't hiding anymore. When their eyes met, he nodded once. Calm. Certain. *You've got this.*

Second game, she found her focus. Won 21-17.

Third game, everything came together. Every shot was precise, every movement economical. She played like someone who had nothing left to lose and everything to prove. Won 21-15.

Silver medal. Again.

But this time, it didn't feel like failure. It felt like triumph.

When the ceremony ended, Ethan was waiting. "You were incredible."

"I was okay."

"You were incredible," he insisted. "The way you came back after losing the first game? That was pure determination."

Coach Martinez approached. "Good match, Sophia. Your parents called. They're driving down to get you."

Sophia's stomach plummeted. "What? When?"

"They left Winnipeg an hour ago. They'll be here by three."

"But I have a ride—"

"I know. I told them. They insisted." Coach Martinez's expression was sympathetic. "I'm sorry. I tried to convince them you were fine, but..."

"They don't trust me anymore," Sophia finished.

"They're scared. There's a difference."

But the result was the same. Her parents were coming. Which meant—

"We should go," Ethan said quietly. "Now. Before they get here."

"Ethan—"

"If we leave now, we can make it back to Winnipeg by 2:30. I can pack and still make my flight. If we wait..."

If they waited, their parents would intersect here. In Grand Forks. The confrontation would happen in public, in front of the entire badminton tournament.

"Okay," Sophia said. "Let's go."

They practically ran to his truck. Ethan started it, began scraping ice while it warmed up. Sophia threw her bag in the back, checking her phone. Text from her mom: *We're coming to get you. Do NOT leave with that boy.*

Too late.

The drive back was nothing like the drive down. No comfortable silence, no playlist, no stolen glances. Just the weight of what was coming pressing down on them both.

They made good time on the cleared highways. Too good. By 2:00 PM, they were approaching Winnipeg, the familiar skyline rising from the prairie.

"Your house or mine?" Ethan asked.

"Yours is on the way to the airport."

"My parents will be there."

"Mine are almost to Grand Forks by now. They'll have to turn around."

He took the exit for River Heights, winding through familiar streets toward home. Toward goodbye. Toward whatever came next.

But as they turned onto his street, Ethan slammed on the brakes.

Both their parents' cars were in his driveway. All four parents were standing outside in the cold, waiting.

"Shit," Ethan breathed.

"How did they—"

"They must have figured out we'd come here." He looked at her. "We could leave. Just drive to the airport. Not deal with this."

"They'd follow us."

"Yeah."

They sat for a moment, engine running, staring at the parental firing squad waiting for them.

"Whatever happens," Sophia said, "I love you."

"I love you too."

Ethan pulled into the driveway. Before they could even open their doors, Robert Price was striding toward them, face thunderous.

"Get out of the truck. Now."

They got out. Sophia's parents hurried over—but wait, how were they here? They were supposed to be driving to Grand Forks.

"We never left," her mother said, reading her confusion. "We lied. We knew you'd run if you knew we were coming here instead."

The betrayal stung more than it should have.

"Where the hell have you been?" Robert demanded.

"I drove Sophia to nationals," Ethan said, voice steady. "She won silver medal."

"Don't." Robert's voice was ice. "Don't try to make this sound noble. You lied. You both lied. You disappeared into a blizzard—"

"We were safe—"

"You were in a hotel room! Together! We checked with the Holiday Inn. One room. Mr. Price and guest."

The words hung in the air. Sophia felt her face burn, her parents' disappointment like a physical weight.

"Sophia." Her mother's voice was quiet, devastated. "How could you?"

"It wasn't—we didn't plan—"

"You didn't plan to share a hotel room with a boy? While lying to us about where you were?"

"The storm—"

"There are always excuses," her father said. "But choices have consequences."

"You're right," Sophia said, finding her voice. "They do. And I chose. I chose to go to nationals with someone I trust instead of alone on a bus. I chose to weather the storm with him instead of with strangers. I chose—"

"You chose to throw away your reputation for teenage romance," her mother interrupted.

"I chose love," Sophia said simply. "And I'd choose it again."

The silence was deafening. Then Robert laughed—cold, bitter.

"Love. You're eighteen years old. You don't know what love is."

"I know it's not control," Ethan said suddenly. Everyone turned to look at him. "I know it's not manipulation or threats or forcing someone into a life they don't want."

"Watch your tone—"

"No. I'm done watching my anything." Ethan stepped forward. "I'm eighteen. Legal adult. I made a choice to drive someone I care about to a tournament. We got caught in a storm. We stayed safe. End of story."

"End of story?" Robert's voice rose. "You're supposed to be on a plane in three hours!"

"Yeah. And I'll be on it."

That stopped everyone. Even Sophia looked surprised.

"You will?" Caroline asked.

"Yeah. I'll go to prep school. I'll try." He looked at his father. "But not because you're forcing me. Because Sophia helped me see that I should at least try. That I'll regret it if I don't."

Robert blinked, momentarily thrown.

"But," Ethan continued, "I'm going on my terms. I'll have my own phone—one you don't monitor. I'll call whoever I want, whenever I want. And spring break, I'm coming home. Non-negotiable."

"You don't get to set terms—"

"Actually, I do. Because if you want me to go—if you want me to play hockey and be your NHL investment—then you need to give me something. And what I need is the ability to have my own life alongside hockey."

"Meaning her." Robert pointed at Sophia.

"Meaning my own choices. But yes, including her."

Father and son stared at each other. The tension was suffocating.

Then a neighbor called out: "Everything okay over there?"

Everyone turned. Mrs. Patterson from next door was on her porch, clearly concerned about the raised voices.

"Fine," Caroline called back, forcing a smile. "Family discussion."

But more neighbors were watching now. The Prices' perfect facade was cracking in public.

"Inside," Robert said tersely. "Now."

"No," Ethan said. "I need to pack. My flight's in three hours, remember?"

He walked to the back of his truck, pulled out his bag. Then turned to Sophia.

"Thank you. For this weekend. For everything."

Before anyone could stop him, he crossed to her, cupped her face, and kissed her. Right there in the driveway, in front of both sets of parents, in front of the watching neighbors.

When he pulled back, Sophia was crying.

"Ten weeks," he whispered. "Wait for me."

"Always."

Robert grabbed Ethan's arm. "Inside. Now."

But Ethan pulled free. "I can walk."

He headed toward the house. Robert and Caroline followed, arguing in harsh whispers.

Sophia's parents stood frozen for a moment. Then her mother said, "Car. Now."

They drove home in awful silence. Sophia sat in the back, watching the city pass, knowing Ethan was packing, knowing in hours he'd be gone.

Her phone buzzed. The burner number.

*I'm going. But I'm coming back. I love you. This isn't over.*

She typed back: *I love you too. Ten weeks.*

*69 days. I'm counting.*

*Me too.*

When they got home, her parents finally exploded.

"A hotel room? Overnight? With a boy?" Her mother paced the living room. "Do you have any idea what people will say?"

"I don't care what people say."

"You should care! Reputation matters!"

"To who? The badminton community? My future college applications? Or just to you?"

"Don't take that tone—"

"What tone should I take? You lied about Grand Forks. You ambushed us. You're acting like I committed a crime when all I did was—"

"All you did was disappear with a boy whose family we don't even know, lie about where you were, spend the night together in a hotel—"

"Because of a blizzard!"

"There are always excuses!"

"They're not excuses, they're reasons!"

The argument went in circles. Her father finally said, "Go to your room. We'll discuss consequences tomorrow."

Sophia went upstairs, closed her door, collapsed on her bed. Her phone showed 5:47 PM. Ethan's flight was at 8:00. He was probably leaving for the airport now.

Text from him: *On the way to airport. Parents silent. I think my dad might actually explode.*

*Are you okay?*

*No. But I will be. You?*

*Same.*

*I found out something. My dad has business in California next week. My mom's going with him.*

*So?*

*So I'll have unsupervised computer access at school. Video calls?*

*Yes. Every night.*

*Every night. I love you.*

*I love you too. Text when you board.*

At 7:45, he texted: *About to board. See you in 69 days.*

*68 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes.*

*But who's counting?*

*Both of us.*

*Yeah. Both of us.*

And then he was gone. On a plane to Michigan, to prep school, to the life his father had planned.

Sophia lay on her bed, still in her badminton clothes, staring at the ceiling. Everything hurt. Her chest felt hollow, like something essential had been scooped out.

Her phone rang. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Don't hang up." Robert Price's voice. "This is the only warning you'll get."

"Warning about what?"

"Stay away from my son. Don't call, don't text, don't contact him."

"You can't—"

"I can and I will. I have lawyers, Sophia. Good ones. If you continue to interfere with Ethan's future, I'll make your family's life very difficult. Your father's job, your mother's visa renewal, your college applications. I have reach. Don't test it."

"Are you threatening me? A seventeen-year-old?"

"I'm explaining consequences. Ethan has a path. A future. You're not part of it."

"That's his choice, not yours."

"He's eighteen. Still dependent on me for everything. That gives me leverage."

"That's not parenting, that's hostage-taking."

Robert laughed coldly. "Call it what you want. But if you care about him—really care—you'll let him go. Let him focus on hockey. Let him have the future he's worked for."

"The future you've worked for."

"Same thing."

"It's really not."

"Stay away from him, Sophia. Or I'll make sure you regret it."

The line went dead.

Sophia stared at her phone. Then, deliberately, she opened her text thread with Ethan's burner number.

*Your dad just called. Threatened me. Told me to stay away from you.*

Three dots appeared immediately. Then: *I KNEW he'd do something. I'm so sorry.*

*Don't be. I'm not scared of him.*

*You should be. He doesn't make empty threats.*

*Neither do I. And I'm not giving up on us.*

*You sure? It's going to be hard. Ten weeks of this.*

*69 days. We can do 69 days.*

*I love you so much.*

*I love you too. Now turn off your phone before the flight attendant yells at you.*

*Already yelling. Gotta go. Talk tomorrow?*

*Every day.*

*Every day. Promise.*

*Promise.*

She set her phone down just as her mom knocked.

"Sophia? Dinner."

"Not hungry."

"You need to eat."

"I need to be alone."

Long pause. Then footsteps retreating.

Sophia's phone buzzed. Maya: *Heard you're back. Heard it was dramatic. You okay?*

*No. But I will be.*

*Want to talk about it?*

*Tomorrow. Tonight I just need to be sad.*

*Fair. Love you.*

*Love you too.*

She curled up on her bed, still dressed, and let herself cry. For the weekend that had changed everything. For the boy on a plane to Michigan. For the war she'd just entered with Robert Price. For the innocence they'd lost and the future they'd chosen.

Her phone buzzed once more. Voice message from Ethan's burner.

She opened it: "Hey. So I'm on the plane, about to take off. Everyone's staring because I'm leaving a voice message like it's 2005. But I needed you to hear my voice saying this: I love you. I'm coming back. Ten weeks is nothing. We've already waited eight years, right? What's another 69 days? Also, my dad's texting me threats about you, but I don't care. He can't control this. He can control a lot, but not how I feel about you. Not that. Never that. Okay, flight attendant actually looks murderous now. I love you. Wait for me."

She listened to it three times before finally falling asleep, phone clutched in her hand.

---

Saturday, January 7th, 11:47 PM.

Sophia woke to her phone vibrating. Text from unknown number: *Made it to Michigan. Prep school is basically a hockey prison. Roommate seems okay. I already miss you so much I can't breathe.*

She sat up, texting back: *Can you talk?*

*Not voice. Roommate's here. But text yes.*

*Your dad threatened me tonight.*

*I know. He texted me about it. I'm so sorry.*

*Stop apologizing for him.*

*You're right. I'm sorry. Wait, shit, I just apologized for apologizing.*

She laughed despite everything. *Dork.*

*Your dork.*

*Yeah. Mine.*

*69 days.*

*68 days, 7 hours, 13 minutes.*

*Math nerd.*

*Hockey dork.*

*Perfect match.*

*Perfect.*

They texted for an hour. About nothing. Everything. The mundane details that somehow mattered desperately—what his room looked like, what she'd had for dinner (nothing), how the ice rink smelled different in Michigan.

Finally: *I should sleep. 5 AM practice.*

*Gross.*

*Yeah. But 68 days.*

*68 days. I love you.*

*I love you too. More tomorrow?*

*Every day.*

*Every day.*

She set her phone down and looked out her window. The moon was bright on the snow, everything silver and shadow. Somewhere in Michigan, Ethan was looking at the same moon.

68 days.

They could do this.

They had to.

But then her phone buzzed one more time. Not Ethan. Her mom's number. But the text was clearly from Robert—she must have left her phone out:

*Final warning. Stay away from my son or face legal consequences. Restraining order paperwork is already drafted. Your choice.*

Sophia stared at the message. Then screenshotted it. Evidence.

She opened her text with Ethan: *Your dad's escalating. Using my mom's phone to threaten restraining order.*

His response was immediate: *WHAT. That's insane. He can't—*

*He's trying to scare me off.*

*Is it working?*

She thought about it. Really thought about it. The smart choice would be to walk away. Let Ethan go to prep school, have his hockey career, live the life planned for him. Protect herself and her family from Robert's threats.

The smart choice.

The safe choice.

But she'd already torn up MIT. Already chosen chaos over certainty.

*No. It's not working. It's pissing me off.*

*That's my girl.*

*68 days.*

*68 days. Together.*

*Together.*

And as she finally fell back asleep, Sophia thought: *Let Robert Price bring his lawyers and threats. Let him try to scare me. I'm seventeen years old and I've already given up MIT for love. What else have I got to lose?*

Everything, maybe.

But some things were worth everything.

Ethan was worth everything.

68 days to prove it.

**EPISODE 5 ENDS**
