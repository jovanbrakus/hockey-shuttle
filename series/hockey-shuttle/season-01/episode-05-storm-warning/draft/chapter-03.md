# CHAPTER 3: THE STORM

## JANUARY 6, JUNIOR YEAR

Sophia woke to whiteness.

Not the soft gray of early morning—complete, blinding whiteness outside the hotel window. For a disoriented moment, she thought she'd gone blind. Then her eyes adjusted and she realized: the storm had hit.

She sat up, pulling the blanket around her shoulders. The clock on the nightstand said 7:04 AM. The other bed was empty, sheets tangled. Ethan's voice came from the bathroom, muffled through the closed door.

"—I understand that, but I physically cannot drive in this. Have you looked outside?"

Pause.

"I don't care if you're disappointed. I'm not risking dying in a ditch to get home twelve hours earlier."

His father. Had to be. Sophia's stomach clenched.

"Mom, I— yes, I know. Yes. I will. When the roads are clear." Another pause, longer. "I don't—that's not—" His voice cracked slightly. "Can we please not do this right now?"

Sophia got out of bed and went to the window. The view was surreal. The parking lot had disappeared under what looked like two feet of snow. Ethan's truck was a vague shape, completely buried. The roads were invisible. And it was still snowing—heavy, wind-driven flakes that reduced visibility to maybe twenty feet.

They weren't going anywhere.

The bathroom door opened. Ethan emerged, phone still in his hand, his face pale and drawn. When he saw her at the window, he stopped.

"How bad?" he asked.

"Really bad."

He crossed to stand beside her, looking out. "Jesus."

"Your mom?"

"Yeah. And my dad before that. They're—they're really angry." He rubbed his face. "My dad said if I don't come home the second the roads clear, I'm not going to prep school. I'm not going to college. He'll cut me off completely."

Sophia's breath caught. "He wouldn't."

"He might. He's—I've never heard him like this. He's furious."

"Because of the storm?"

"Because of you." Ethan looked at her, his expression anguished. "He knows you're here. Somehow he figured it out. And he thinks you're—he used the word 'distraction.' He said I'm throwing away my future for a distraction."

The word hit her like a slap. Distraction. Like she was some trivial thing, some hobby Ethan needed to quit so he could focus on what really mattered.

"Maybe I am," she said quietly.

"Don't." His voice was sharp. "Don't say that."

"But what if he's right? What if I'm distracting you from—"

"From what? From hockey? From his plan for my life?" Ethan's laugh was bitter. "Good. I want to be distracted from that. I need to be distracted from that. Because if I'm not, I'm going to wake up at thirty and realize I've lived someone else's life for twenty years."

He turned away from the window, pacing the small room. His hands were shaking.

"Ethan—"

"I don't want to talk about my parents right now." He stopped pacing, looked at her. "Can we please just—not talk about them? For a few hours?"

Sophia nodded. "Okay."

"Okay." He took a breath, visibly trying to calm himself. "Have you checked your phone? About the tournament?"

She grabbed her phone from the nightstand. Three texts from Coach Martinez: *Tournament postponed until further notice. Blizzard. Stay safe wherever you are.*

"Postponed," she told Ethan.

"For how long?"

"Doesn't say. Just until the storm passes."

He checked his own phone, scrolled through weather alerts. "Forecast says it should clear by tonight. Roads will take until tomorrow morning to get plowed."

"So we're stuck here for today."

"Looks like it."

They stood in the middle of the room, looking at each other. Trapped together. Nowhere to go. Nothing to do but be here, in this space, with all the things they hadn't said yet hanging between them.

"Are you hungry?" Ethan asked finally.

"A little."

"There's a restaurant downstairs. It might be open."

They got dressed quickly—Sophia in jeans and Ethan's borrowed hoodie, Ethan in the same clothes from yesterday. The hotel hallway was still eerily quiet. They took the stairs down to the lobby.

The restaurant was open, mostly empty except for a few other stranded travelers. They got a table by the window overlooking the parking lot. The waitress brought coffee and menus.

"Storm's something else," she said, filling their cups. "I've lived here twenty years, never seen it this bad."

"When do you think the roads will be clear?" Sophia asked.

"Tomorrow morning at earliest. Maybe afternoon." The waitress smiled sympathetically. "You folks just have to wait it out. Could be worse places to be stuck."

Could be, Sophia thought. Could be better too.

They ordered breakfast. While they waited, Sophia checked her phone again. Text from Maya: *OMG are you okay?? News says Grand Forks is completely snowed in!!*

Sophia typed back: *I'm fine. Stuck at hotel until roads clear. Probably tomorrow.*

*Are you with him?*

*Yeah.*

*OMG OMG OMG*

*Stop.*

*This is so romantic though!!*

*It's terrifying.*

*Same thing. Be safe. Update me later.*

Sophia set her phone down. Across the table, Ethan was staring into his coffee like it held answers.

"Who'd you text?" he asked.

"Maya. She's freaking out about the storm."

"Jordan texted me too. Everyone's freaking out." He took a drink of coffee, made a face. "This is terrible."

"Hotel coffee usually is."

"We should have gone to Starbucks."

"There's three feet of snow outside."

"Details."

She smiled despite herself. He smiled back, and for a moment it felt almost normal. Just two people having breakfast, making jokes about bad coffee. Not two teenagers trapped in a hotel room, counting down hours until separation, with their parents' anger hanging over them like a sword.

But then breakfast came, and they ate in heavy silence, and the normalcy evaporated.

Finally Sophia couldn't take it anymore. "We should talk."

Ethan looked up. "About what?"

"About—all of it. Your dad. Prep school. What happens after tomorrow."

"I thought we weren't going to think past three days."

"That was before we got trapped in a blizzard. Before your dad threatened to cut you off. Before everything got—" She gestured helplessly. "Complicated."

He set down his fork. "Okay. What do you want to talk about?"

"I don't know. Everything? Nothing? I just feel like we're avoiding the actual conversation."

"What's the actual conversation?"

"The one where we admit that this might not work. That long distance is impossible. That your parents are never going to accept me. That we're fighting a losing battle."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Is that what you think?"

"I don't know what I think. That's the problem."

He pushed his plate away, his appetite clearly gone. "Do you want to give up? Is that what you're saying?"

"No. Maybe. I don't know." Her voice was rising, frustration bleeding through. "I'm saying that I'm terrified. That I don't know how we survive this. That your dad calling you a disappointment because you're with me makes me feel like—like maybe we should just stop. Before it gets worse."

"It's already worse," Ethan said flatly. "My dad already thinks I'm throwing my life away. Stopping now doesn't fix that."

"But at least you'd have your family. Your future. Hockey."

"I'd have his version of my future. Not mine."

"But maybe his version is the right one."

"Why?" His voice was sharp now, angry. "Because he's older? Because he's successful? That doesn't mean he knows what I want. What I need."

"What do you need?"

"I need—" He stopped, breathing hard. Then, quieter: "I need to know that I made my own choice. At least once. I need to know that I chose something for me, even if it's the wrong choice, even if it falls apart. Because if I don't, I'm going to spend the rest of my life wondering what if."

Sophia's throat was tight. "That's a lot of pressure to put on this."

"I know. But that's where we are."

They fell silent. The restaurant was getting busier, other stranded guests coming down for breakfast. Someone turned on the TV in the corner—news footage of the blizzard, warnings to stay inside, roads closed for the foreseeable future.

"I need to tell you something," Sophia said suddenly.

Ethan looked up. "Okay."

"The MIT thing. It wasn't—I didn't tell you the whole story."

His brow furrowed. "What do you mean?"

Here it was. The confession she'd been avoiding. The truth that would change how he saw her, how he saw his father, how he saw everything.

"Your dad came to my house in October," she said. "Before Halloween. He brought a letter from MIT. A guarantee. Full ride. Early decision. He said if I accepted it, I'd have everything figured out. I'd be set."

Ethan had gone very still. "My dad offered you MIT?"

"Yeah."

"How? He doesn't work at MIT. He can't just—"

"He has connections. Donors he works with. He made calls." She couldn't look at him. "He said MIT was perfect for me. That it would make my parents proud. That it was the smart choice."

"And you considered it." His voice was flat.

"Yeah. For like six weeks, I considered it."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Because—" She forced herself to look at him. "Because he told me not to. He said you didn't need to know. That it would make you feel guilty, like you were holding me back. And he was right. If I'd told you, you would have told me to take it."

"I would have," Ethan admitted. "I would have said MIT is an incredible opportunity and you should take it."

"I know. That's why I didn't tell you." She took a shaky breath. "But I also considered it because—because it was easier. Because having everything planned out felt safer than not knowing. Because my parents were so happy when I told them about it. Because for six weeks, I had this golden path laid out in front of me and all I had to do was say yes."

"But you didn't say yes."

"No. I didn't."

"Why not?"

This was the hard part. The part she hadn't even fully admitted to herself. "Because it felt like a bribe. Like your dad was paying me to stay away from you."

Ethan's face went white. "That's not—he wouldn't—"

"He didn't say it out loud. But that's what it was. He saw us getting close and he offered me a way out. A way to choose my future over you. And for six weeks I almost took it."

"But you tore up the letter."

"Yeah. On January second. Two days before this trip. I tore it up and I told my parents I wanted to apply regular decision to a bunch of schools. They were furious. Disappointed. And I knew—I knew it was partially because of you. Because I couldn't take the bribe and be with you at the same time."

Ethan stood abruptly, his chair scraping. He walked to the window, staring out at the white nothing. Sophia waited, her heart pounding.

Finally he said, "My dad tried to pay you to leave me."

"He tried to give me an opportunity."

"Don't defend him." His voice was hard. "He saw us together and decided I needed to focus. And instead of talking to me about it, he went behind my back and offered you MIT. Like you were a problem he could solve with money and connections."

"Ethan—"

He turned around. His eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Why didn't you take it?"

"What?"

"MIT. Why didn't you take it? You should have taken it. It's an incredible opportunity. You'd be set for life. Why would you turn that down for—for this?" He gestured between them. "For me?"

"Because I wanted to choose for myself. Because I didn't want his bribe, even if it came wrapped in a perfect school. Because—" Her voice cracked. "Because choosing me meant choosing us."

Ethan crossed the room in three steps, pulling her out of her chair and into his arms. He was shaking. "I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry. That he put you in that position. That you had to choose. You should have taken it. You should have—"

"Stop," she said into his chest. "Stop apologizing for your father. Stop telling me I should have taken it. I made my choice. It's done."

"But you gave up MIT. For me."

"For me," she corrected, pulling back to look at him. "I gave up his version of my future. I don't know what my future looks like now. But it's mine. That's what matters."

He stared at her, his face a mess of emotions she couldn't untangle. Then he kissed her—desperate, hard, tasting like coffee and salt from tears she didn't know he'd shed.

When they broke apart, they were both breathing hard.

"We should go back upstairs," Ethan said hoarsely.

"Yeah. Okay."

They went back to the room in silence, took the stairs because the elevator felt too public. In the hallway outside room 247, Ethan stopped, key card in hand.

"Just so you know," he said, not looking at her. "I'm furious at my father right now. Possibly for the first time in my life, I actually hate him."

"You don't hate him."

"I do. For what he did to you. For thinking he could control who I spend time with. For—" His voice broke. "For making you choose."

"He didn't make me choose. I chose anyway."

"Because of him."

"Because of me. Because I wanted you more than I wanted the easy path." She took the key card from his hand and unlocked the door. "Come on. Let's go inside."

---

The room felt smaller than it had this morning. More intimate. Sophia was hyperaware of the beds, the closed door, the fact that they were alone together with nowhere to go and nothing to do but talk.

Ethan sat on his bed, elbows on his knees, head in his hands. Sophia sat on her own bed, watching him.

"I need to ask you something," he said without looking up.

"Okay."

"Do you regret it? Rejecting MIT?"

"No."

"Not even a little?"

"Not even a little."

He finally looked up. "Why not?"

"Because—" She tried to find the right words. "Because I spent my whole life making the smart choice. The safe choice. The choice everyone expected. And I was good at it. I got perfect grades, won badminton tournaments, made my parents proud. But I never felt like—like I was choosing. I was just doing what made sense. What came next."

"And MIT was what came next."

"Yeah. The logical next step. But when I thought about it—about four years in Boston, studying engineering, following the path your dad laid out—it didn't feel like my life. It felt like someone else's life that I was borrowing."

Ethan nodded slowly. "I know that feeling."

"I know you do. Your whole life has been someone else's plan."

"Twelve years of it. Since I was six and my dad decided I could be NHL material." He laughed bitterly. "Do you know what it's like, having your entire future planned before you're old enough to understand what a future is?"

"No. But I'm starting to."

They sat in silence. Outside, the storm continued, wind howling against the window. The hotel room felt like a capsule, a space separate from the rest of the world. Sophia had the surreal feeling that if they walked outside, there would be nothing there—just whiteness forever.

"Can I tell you something?" Ethan said.

"Yeah."

"I don't want to play hockey anymore."

The words fell into the room like stones.

Sophia stared at him. "What?"

"I don't want to play hockey anymore," he repeated, louder. "Or—I don't know. Maybe I do. But I don't want it to be my whole life. I don't want to go to prep school and then college hockey and then NHL draft and then—whatever comes after. I don't want that to be all I am."

"What do you want?"

"I want to study astrophysics. I want to understand how the universe works, why stars collapse, what happens at the edge of black holes. I want to take art classes and philosophy classes and read books that have nothing to do with sports. I want to—" He broke off, frustrated. "I want to be a person. Not just a hockey player."

Sophia's chest felt tight. "Have you told your parents this?"

"No. How could I? They've invested everything in my hockey career. Money, time, their entire identity is wrapped up in me being good at hockey. If I quit, it would destroy them."

"So you're going to keep playing? Even though you don't want to?"

"I don't know." He looked at her, and his face was young and scared in a way she'd never seen. "That's the thing. I don't know what to do. If I quit, I lose everything. My family, their support, the future they've built for me. But if I keep playing, I lose myself. And I don't know which is worse."

Sophia crossed to his bed, sat down beside him. "I don't think there's a right answer."

"That's not helpful."

"I know. But it's true." She took his hand. "Whatever you choose, it's going to hurt. Either you hurt them by choosing yourself, or you hurt yourself by choosing them. There's no path where everyone wins."

"That's depressing."

"It's honest."

He laughed, surprised. "When did you become the wise one?"

"I think somewhere around when I tore up a guaranteed MIT acceptance."

"Fair point." He squeezed her hand. "What are we doing, Sophia? Really?"

"I don't know. Surviving? Trying to figure out who we are without our parents' expectations?"

"Is it working?"

"Ask me tomorrow."

He smiled at that, recognizing his own words from last night. "Okay. Tomorrow."

They sat together, hands linked, listening to the storm. And then Ethan said, very quietly, "I love you."

The world stopped.

Sophia's breath caught. She turned to look at him, and he was already looking at her, his expression open and terrified and honest.

"I've loved you since we were nine years old," he continued. "Since you fell on the ice and I helped you up and you laughed instead of crying. Since you chose badminton over hockey and I was devastated because I thought I'd never see you again. Since I moved back to Winnipeg and walked into Spanish class and there you were, and it was like—like coming home."

Tears were streaming down Sophia's face. She didn't even know when she'd started crying.

"I love you," he said again. "And I know that's a lot. I know we're seventeen and everyone thinks teenage love isn't real. But this is real. You're the most real thing in my life. And I needed to tell you that before—before everything falls apart tomorrow."

"It's not falling apart," she whispered.

"It is though. We both know it is. I'm leaving tomorrow night. We don't know when we'll see each other again. My parents hate you, your parents are disappointed in you, and we're stuck in a hotel room in North Dakota in a blizzard because we were too stubborn to be smart." He laughed, wet and broken. "Everything is falling apart. But I love you anyway."

Sophia couldn't speak. Her throat was too tight, her heart too full. So instead she kissed him—soft and desperate and full of every word she couldn't say.

When they broke apart, she said, "I love you too."

He went very still. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. I love you too. I have for—I don't know how long. Months? Years? Maybe forever?" She wiped her eyes, smiling through tears. "And you're right, it's terrifying. Because loving you means choosing chaos over certainty. It means fighting for something that might not work. It means—"

"Being brave," he finished.

"Yeah. Being brave." She took a shaky breath. "I love you, Ethan Price. Even though it's stupid and impossible and probably going to break both our hearts. I love you."

He kissed her again, and this time it was different—slower, deeper, full of promise instead of desperation. His hands tangled in her hair, her hands gripped his shoulders, and for a long perfect moment, nothing else existed except this: his mouth on hers, his heartbeat against her chest, the feeling of being wholly, completely seen by another person.

When they finally broke apart, they were both breathing hard. Ethan's eyes were dark, his face flushed. Sophia's whole body felt electric, alive in a way she'd never experienced.

"We should—" Ethan started, then stopped. "I don't know what we should do."

"Me neither."

They looked at each other, the air between them charged with possibility. The storm howled outside. The world had narrowed to this room, this moment, this choice.

Sophia thought about the MIT letter, about choosing for herself, about being brave enough to want what she wanted.

"I want you," she said quietly. "Is that okay to say?"

Ethan's breath hitched. "Yeah. It's—yeah." He paused. "I want you too."

"So what do we do about that?"

"I don't know. What do you want to do?"

She didn't have an answer. Or rather, she had too many answers. She wanted to kiss him more, wanted his hands on her skin, wanted to know what it felt like to be close to someone in every possible way. She wanted to stay in this room forever, protected from the future and the storm and all the forces trying to pull them apart.

But she also wanted to be careful. Wanted to not rush. Wanted their first time—if there was a first time—to be right. Not just because they were trapped in a hotel room with nothing else to do.

"I don't want to do something we'll regret," she said finally.

"I wouldn't regret it."

"You don't know that."

"I do though." He cupped her face, thumb brushing away remaining tears. "I know that being with you—however that looks—would never be a regret. But if you're not sure, we don't do anything. We just—we can just be here. Together."

Sophia closed her eyes, leaning into his touch. She wanted to be sure. Wanted to be the kind of person who knew what she wanted and went for it without hesitation. But she was seventeen and scared and the stakes felt impossibly high.

"Can we—" She opened her eyes. "Can we just lie down? For a while? I want to be close to you. But I don't know if I'm ready for—for everything."

"Yeah. Of course. Whatever you want."

They shifted on the bed, lying down side by side. Ethan pulled her close, her head on his chest, his arms around her. They fit together perfectly, like they'd been designed for this exact position.

Outside, the blizzard raged. Inside, they lay in quiet intimacy, just breathing together.

"Tell me something," Sophia said after a long silence.

"Like what?"

"Something you've never told anyone."

He was quiet, thinking. Then: "I have panic attacks sometimes. Before big games. I lock myself in the bathroom and just—freak out. Can't breathe, feel like I'm dying. It passes after a few minutes, but it's terrifying every time."

Sophia's chest tightened. "Does anyone know?"

"Jordan knows. He found me once. Helped me through it. But no one else. Definitely not my parents."

"What triggers them?"

"The pressure, I think. Knowing that everyone's watching, expecting me to be perfect. Knowing that if I fail, I'm letting everyone down. It gets too much and my body just—shuts down."

She hugged him tighter. "That sounds awful."

"It is." He pressed his face into her hair. "But you know what? I haven't had one in weeks. Not since we started spending time together."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I think—I think being with you reminds me that I'm more than hockey. That even if I fail at that, I still exist. I'm still a person."

Sophia felt tears prick her eyes again. "You're definitely a person. A really good person."

"You have to say that. You love me."

"I love you because you're a good person. Not despite it."

He kissed the top of her head. "Your turn. Tell me something."

"Um. I'm terrified of not mattering. Like, I work really hard at everything—school, badminton, being a good daughter—because I'm scared that if I'm not exceptional, I'll just disappear. Like I'll be invisible."

"That's not possible. You could never be invisible."

"You don't know that."

"I do. You're the opposite of invisible. You're—" He paused, searching for words. "You're like a star. You might not be the brightest one in the sky, but once someone sees you, they can't look away."

She laughed, surprised. "That's incredibly cheesy."

"Doesn't make it less true."

They fell quiet again. Sophia listened to his heartbeat, steady and strong. His hand traced absent patterns on her back. Time seemed suspended, like they'd fallen out of the normal flow of things into some parallel space where nothing existed but this moment.

"Sophia?" Ethan's voice was quiet, hesitant.

"Yeah?"

"If I asked you—if we—" He stopped, frustrated. "I'm not saying this right."

She lifted her head to look at him. "What are you trying to say?"

"I'm trying to say that I want—" He took a breath. "I want to be with you. Completely. But I also want it to be right. And I don't know if now is right, with everything that's about to happen. With me leaving tomorrow. With—everything."

Sophia's heart was pounding. "What do you think would make it right?"

"I don't know. Time? Certainty? Knowing we have a future together instead of just—stealing moments when we can?"

"We might not ever have that. Certainty."

"I know. That's what makes this so hard."

She studied his face—the earnest brown eyes, the worried line between his brows, the mouth she'd kissed so many times already. She loved him. She knew that absolutely. But did that mean they should—?

"Can I say something that might sound weird?" she asked.

"Always."

"I think—I think if we do this now, it would be because we're scared. Because you're leaving and we don't know when we'll see each other again. And that's not—that's not the right reason."

Ethan nodded slowly. "You're right."

"I'm not saying I don't want to. I do. But I want to want it for the right reasons. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense." He brushed hair off her forehead. "So we wait."

"We wait," she agreed. "Until we're not scared. Until we have time. Until—"

"Until it's right," he finished.

"Yeah."

They looked at each other, and despite the disappointment, despite the wanting, Sophia felt relief. They'd made the choice together. They'd chosen to wait. And somehow that felt more intimate than anything else they could have done.

"Come here," Ethan said, pulling her back down to his chest.

She settled against him, his arms tight around her. Outside, the storm showed no signs of stopping. Inside, they lay together in peaceful silence, just existing in the same space.

Sophia thought about tomorrow. About him leaving. About the separation stretching out ahead of them like an impossible distance. But right now—right now they had this. This room. This storm. This moment of perfect honesty.

"Ethan?" she murmured, half-asleep.

"Hmm?"

"I'm glad we're here. Even with everything."

"Me too."

"I'm glad I chose you."

"I'm glad you chose you."

She smiled against his chest. "Same thing."

"Yeah," he agreed. "Same thing."

They fell asleep like that—fully clothed, wrapped around each other, the storm raging outside while inside they found unexpected peace. And when they woke hours later, tangled together in the late afternoon light, Sophia's first thought was: This is what it feels like to be chosen. This is what it feels like to choose.

Tomorrow they'd face consequences. Tomorrow he'd leave. Tomorrow everything would fall apart.

But for today—for this perfect, storm-bound day—they had each other.

And that was enough.

More than enough.

It was everything.

---

They woke to softer light, the storm's rage diminished to steady snowfall. Ethan checked his phone: 4:47 PM.

"We slept for hours," he said, voice rough with sleep.

"Mmm." Sophia didn't want to move, didn't want to leave the warm cocoon of his arms.

"We should eat something."

"Don't want to."

He laughed. "Come on. I'm starving."

Reluctantly, she sat up. Her hair was a mess, her clothes rumpled. Ethan looked equally disheveled. They smiled at each other—tired, soft smiles that acknowledged the intimacy of sleeping beside someone, waking up together.

"Room service?" he suggested.

"Yeah. Room service."

They ordered burgers and fries, ate sitting on his bed with the TV on mute showing news coverage of the blizzard. The food was mediocre but tasted perfect because they were eating it together, in their bubble, protected from the world.

"Storm's supposed to clear tonight," Ethan said, checking his phone. "Roads will be plowed by tomorrow morning."

"So we can leave tomorrow."

"Yeah. Your semifinals will probably be rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon. We'd leave after that."

"And then you go to Michigan."

"And then I go to Michigan," he confirmed quietly.

They didn't talk about it more. Didn't let tomorrow intrude on today. They finished eating, watched a movie on TV—some action thing neither of them really paid attention to. They lay together, comfortable in the silence, hands linked.

As evening fell and the hotel room darkened, Sophia felt the weight of what was coming. One more night. Then the drive home. Then goodbye.

She must have tensed because Ethan pulled her closer. "Hey. Still here. Still together."

"For now."

"For now is all we ever have. Right?"

She nodded against him, even though it hurt to acknowledge. They'd only ever had moments—stolen hours, secret meetings, three days on the road. Maybe that was all they'd ever get. Maybe this was their whole story: a series of beautiful, impossible moments strung together before circumstances pulled them apart.

But God, what moments they were.

"I love you," she said into the darkness.

"I love you too."

And as the blizzard finally quieted outside, leaving a world buried in white and silence, they held each other in room 247 of a Holiday Inn in Grand Forks, North Dakota—two teenagers in love, making promises they didn't know if they could keep.

But promising anyway.

Because that's what love was: choosing to believe in impossible things.

Choosing each other, again and again, despite everything.

Choosing bravery over certainty.

Choosing now, even when tomorrow was uncertain.

And as they fell asleep again, still clothed, still wrapped around each other, Sophia thought: Whatever happens next, we had this. This perfect, storm-bound day when we chose each other completely.

No one could take that away.

Not his parents, not hers, not distance or time or any of the forces working against them.

This was theirs.

Forever.
