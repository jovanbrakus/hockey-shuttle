# CHAPTER 2: THE ROAD

## JANUARY 5, JUNIOR YEAR

The world was still dark when they hit Highway 75 heading south.

Sophia watched the city lights disappear behind them, each streetlight a small goodbye. Manitoba in January at six-thirty AM looked like another planet—flat white nothing in every direction, the sky heavy with unspent snow.

Ethan drove with both hands on the wheel, careful on the winter roads. They hadn't spoken much since leaving the city. The silence wasn't uncomfortable exactly, but it was heavy with everything they weren't saying: *We're really doing this. Our parents are going to kill us. There's a blizzard coming.*

She studied his profile in the dashboard light—the tension in his jaw, the way his thumbs tapped nervously against the steering wheel. He'd gotten maybe two hours of sleep, same as her, and it showed in the shadows under his eyes.

"You okay?" she asked, first words in twenty minutes.

He glanced at her, a quick smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Yeah. Just... processing."

"Processing what?"

"That we're actually doing this. That you're actually here." His right hand left the wheel, found hers across the console. "That in about six hours, your parents and mine are going to realize we lied, and the world is going to explode."

"Maybe they won't figure it out right away."

"Soph." He squeezed her hand. "My mom probably already knows. She has that terrifying mother instinct. She probably woke up at six-oh-one like 'something's wrong.'"

Sophia laughed despite her nerves. "Your mom is kind of scary."

"She wasn't always. Before my dad got so..." He trailed off, searching for words. "Intense about the hockey thing. She used to be different. Softer."

"When did it change?"

"When I was twelve. First time scouts started seriously watching me. Suddenly I went from 'kid who's good at hockey' to 'future NHL investment.' Everything changed after that."

The sunrise started bleeding across the horizon, pale pink and orange against the white. Beautiful and cold. Ethan reached for the radio, finding the playlist he'd made. The first song was something indie and quiet, a woman's voice over acoustic guitar.

"When did you make this?" Sophia asked.

"Last night. Couldn't sleep, so..." He shrugged, embarrassed. "It's probably too sad."

"It's perfect." She turned their joined hands over, tracing patterns on his palm. "Tell me something."

"Like what?"

"Something you've never told anyone."

He thought for a moment, eyes on the road. "Sometimes I dream about just... disappearing. Not in a bad way. Just getting in my truck and driving until I hit ocean. Starting over somewhere where nobody knows I play hockey."

"Where would you go?"

"I don't know. Somewhere warm maybe? California, or Mexico. Somewhere I could wear shorts in January and nobody would care if I never touched a puck again."

"You'd miss it though. Hockey."

"Would I?" He glanced at her. "I honestly don't know anymore. It's been my whole life for so long, I can't tell if I love it or if I just... am it. Does that make sense?"

"Yeah. I feel that way about badminton sometimes. Like, do I actually enjoy it, or is it just part of my identity now?"

"Exactly." He shifted lanes to pass a slow-moving truck. "Okay, your turn. Something you've never told anyone."

Sophia bit her lip, considering. "Remember when you moved away? When we were nine?"

"Yeah?"

"I cried for three days straight. My mom thought I was sick. Kept trying to take me to the doctor. But I just... I couldn't explain that my best friend was gone and nothing felt right anymore."

Ethan's hand tightened on hers. "Soph..."

"It's okay. It was a long time ago. But sometimes I wonder what would have happened if you hadn't moved. If we'd just... grown up together normally."

"We'd probably be dating by middle school," he said with a small smile. "Would have been that couple everyone was sick of by high school."

"Or we would have dated in middle school, broken up over something stupid, and never talked again."

"Nah." He brought her hand to his lips, kissed her knuckles while keeping his eyes on the road. "I don't think I could ever not talk to you. Even in hypothetical alternate timeline."

The gesture—casual, intimate, like they'd been together for years instead of months—made her stomach flutter. She wanted to unbuckle, slide across the bench seat, curl into his side. But the roads were getting slick with fresh snow, and she could see the concentration in his face.

"Tell me about the playlist," she said instead. "What's each song?"

So he did, explaining each choice as they drove through the frozen morning. This one reminded him of her laugh. That one was playing in the coffee shop when he realized he was falling for her. This one made him think about the future, about possibilities, about them.

They stopped at the Tim Hortons in Morris, halfway to the border. The parking lot was nearly empty—too early for normal people, too cold for anyone optional to be out. They got coffee and breakfast sandwiches, ate in the truck with the heater running.

"You know what's weird?" Ethan said, unwrapping his sandwich. "This feels more real than anything has in months."

"What do you mean?"

"Like... everything else—hockey, prep school, my parents' plans—it all feels like I'm playing a role. Going through the motions. But this?" He gestured between them. "Sitting in a Tim Hortons parking lot at seven-thirty AM, running away to North Dakota with you? This feels like the first real choice I've made in years."

"Even though it's insane?"

"Especially because it's insane." He turned to face her fully. "When was the last time you did something that wasn't planned? That wasn't the 'smart' choice?"

Sophia thought about it. "Honestly? Never. Until this week."

"Right? We've been so good for so long. Perfect grades, perfect sports performance, perfect everything. And where has it gotten us?"

"You're about to go to one of the best prep schools in North America."

"Against my will."

"And I have a shot at any college I want."

"If you can afford it without the MIT guarantee."

They sat with that for a moment, the weight of what they'd given up and what they were choosing instead.

"No regrets though?" Ethan asked quietly.

"No regrets," she confirmed. "You?"

Instead of answering, he leaned across the console and kissed her. Slow and thorough, tasting like coffee and possibility. His hand came up to cup her face, thumb brushing across her cheekbone, and Sophia felt herself melting into him.

When they finally broke apart, they were both breathing hard.

"No regrets," he said against her mouth.

"We should keep driving," she said, not moving away.

"We should."

Neither of them moved for another long moment. Then Ethan's phone buzzed—not his regular phone, the burner he'd bought. Text from Jordan: *Your mom just called my mom. Knows you're not here. Shitstorm incoming.*

"And so it begins," Ethan muttered, showing her the text.

"What do you want to do?"

"Keep driving." He started the truck. "They already know. Can't get in more trouble than we're already in."

As they pulled back onto the highway, Sophia's phone started ringing. Her mom.

"Don't answer," Ethan said.

"If I don't answer, they'll worry I'm dead in a ditch."

"Let them worry for a bit."

She sent it to voicemail. Immediately, a text: *Where are you? Coach Martinez says you're not on the team bus.*

Sophia typed back: *I'm fine. Got another ride to nationals. See you Sunday.*

Her phone immediately started ringing again. She turned it to silent.

"Three missed calls from my dad," Ethan reported, checking his burner. "Four texts from my mom. One from Robert that just says 'Come home now.'"

"What did you tell them?"

"Nothing yet." He tossed the phone into the cupholder. "They can wait. We have" —he checked the time— "three more hours until Grand Forks. Let them stew."

The border crossing was at Pembina, North Dakota. The guard looked at their enhanced licenses, asked about their plans.

"Badminton nationals in Grand Forks," Sophia said from the passenger seat.

"Where are your parents?" the guard asked, suspicious of two teenagers traveling alone.

"Meeting us there," Ethan lied smoothly.

The guard studied them for a long moment, then handed back their IDs. "There's a major storm system moving in tonight. You kids be careful."

"We will," Ethan assured him.

They drove into North Dakota, the landscape somehow even flatter and whiter than Manitoba. The snow was falling steadily now, not heavy yet but consistent.

"Should we talk about the weather?" Sophia asked.

"What about it?"

"The blizzard. The one everyone keeps warning us about."

"It's not supposed to hit until tonight. We'll be in Grand Forks by then. Safe in the hotel."

"And if the tournament is cancelled?"

"Then we have a free weekend in a hotel in North Dakota." He glanced at her, something unreadable in his expression. "Would that be the worst thing?"

Her face heated. "Ethan..."

"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just saying... we'd have time. To talk. To figure things out. To just... be together. Without everyone watching."

"Our parents will probably drive down to get us."

"In a blizzard? Unlikely."

She knew he was right. If they got snowed in, they'd be truly alone for the first time. No friends dropping by, no parents hovering, no timeline except the storm.

The thought was terrifying and thrilling in equal measure.

"Look," Ethan said, maybe sensing her anxiety. "Nothing has to happen. We can get separate rooms if you want. I just... I want time with you. However that looks."

"Same room is fine," she said quietly. "I trust you."

"You sure?"

"Yeah. I mean, we should be smart about money anyway. And..." She took a breath. "I want time with you too. Real time. Without pretending or sneaking around."

He took her hand again, and they drove in comfortable silence through the falling snow. The playlist cycled through, each song feeling like it was written just for them, just for this moment.

"Can I tell you something that might sound stupid?" Ethan asked as they passed a sign for Grand Forks—40 miles.

"Always."

"I keep thinking about that Chinese legend you told me about. The red thread."

"The one connecting people destined to meet?"

"Yeah. I know it's just a story, but sometimes I think about when we were kids. How we just... found each other. On that rink. And then found each other again eight years later. Like there really was some invisible thread pulling us back together."

"That's not stupid," Sophia said softly.

"It's a little stupid."

"Okay, it's a little stupid. But also kind of beautiful?"

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I think about it too sometimes. Like, what were the odds? That your family would move back to Winnipeg? That we'd end up at the same school? That we'd both be dealing with impossible parent expectations at the exact same time?"

"Almost like it was meant to happen."

"Or we're just really good at finding meaning in coincidence."

"Such a romantic," he teased.

"Says the guy who made a three-hour playlist for a road trip."

"Four hours, actually. There's a whole second half you haven't heard yet."

She smiled, settling deeper into the passenger seat. Outside, North Dakota stretched endlessly in every direction—a white canvas waiting for their story to be written on it.

"Ethan?"

"Hmm?"

"Thanks. For this. For choosing this even though it's going to make everything complicated."

"Everything's already complicated. At least this complication is ours."

They reached Grand Forks just after noon. The snow was heavier now, starting to accumulate on the roads. The Alerus Center parking lot was half full—the tournament still happening despite the weather warnings.

"You ready for this?" Ethan asked, parking in a far corner.

Sophia could see the team bus. Coach Martinez was probably wondering where she was. Her teammates would have questions. But none of that mattered as much as the boy sitting next to her, who'd driven four hours through a storm warning just to give them three days together.

"Ready," she said.

They got out of the truck, grabbed their bags, and walked toward the arena. Just before they reached the doors, Ethan caught her hand.

"Hey. Whatever happens next—with the tournament, the storm, our parents—I want you to know this was worth it. You're worth it."

She stood on her toes and kissed him, not caring who might see. "You too. You're worth all of it."

They walked inside holding hands, into the warmth and chaos of the tournament, ready to steal whatever time they could before the storm hit—literal and metaphorical.

And for the first time in weeks, Sophia felt like she could actually breathe.

---

The Alerus Center hummed with pre-tournament energy. Courts being set up, players warming up, coaches barking instructions. Sophia spotted Coach Martinez immediately, standing by the registration desk with a clipboard and a concerned expression.

"I should check in," Sophia said.

"I'll find a hotel," Ethan said. "Text you the details?"

"Yeah."

He squeezed her hand once more, then headed back outside. Sophia walked over to her coach, bracing for the conversation.

"Sophia." Coach Martinez's voice was carefully neutral. "You made it."

"Sorry I wasn't on the bus. I had—a ride."

"So I gathered. Your parents called me this morning. They're concerned."

"I texted them. They know I'm safe."

Coach Martinez studied her for a long moment. "The boy who was with you. That's your ride?"

"Yes."

"The hockey player? The one whose father—" She stopped herself. "Never mind. Not my business. You're here, you're ready to compete?"

"Yes."

"Good. First match is at three. Second at six if you win. Get warmed up."

"Coach—"

"Sophia." Her voice softened. "I was seventeen once. I understand more than you think. But right now, you need to focus on badminton. Whatever else is happening, whatever drama you've got going on—compartmentalize. Can you do that?"

"Yes."

"Good. Go warm up."

Sophia found her team in the corner of the arena. Maya practically tackled her.

"Oh my God, you actually did it! You're here! With him?"

"Shh," Sophia hissed, aware of their other teammates watching. "Yes, okay? Yes."

"This is the most romantic thing ever. Like Romeo and Juliet but with badminton and hockey."

"Romeo and Juliet died, Maya."

"Okay, bad example. But still! Running away together into a storm? That's novel-worthy."

"We didn't run away. We drove to a tournament."

"Sure. That's all." Maya's grin was wicked. "Where is he?"

"Getting a hotel room."

"A room? Singular?"

"Maya!"

"What? I'm just asking what everyone's thinking."

Sophia's phone buzzed. Text from Ethan: *Holiday Inn on South Washington. Room 247. Checked in under my name. They have a restaurant if you want lunch before your match.*

"I have to go," Sophia said. "I'll be back by two-thirty for warmups."

"Sophia Chen, you dirty little—"

"We're getting lunch. Stop."

But she was smiling as she left, Maya's laughter following her out.

---

The Holiday Inn restaurant was nearly empty. Ethan had gotten a corner booth, baseball cap pulled low like he was trying to be incognito.

"Hiding?" she asked, sliding in across from him.

"Your coach looked ready to murder someone. Figured I should lay low."

"She's actually being pretty cool about it."

"Yeah?"

"I think she understands. Being young and making questionable choices for love."

"Love, huh?" His smile was soft, private. "Is that what we're calling it?"

"What would you call it?"

"Love works." He reached across the table, taking her hand. "I love you. In case that wasn't clear."

"I love you too."

It still felt new, saying it out loud. Like something precious they were just learning to hold.

They ordered sandwiches and soup, comfort food for a cold day. Outside the window, snow fell steadily. The parking lot was already covered in a fresh white layer.

"It's getting worse," Sophia observed.

"Yeah. They might cancel the tournament."

"Would you be disappointed?"

She thought about it. "Honestly? Not really. I mean, I want to compete. But also... having an excuse to just be here with you, without agenda? That sounds pretty perfect."

"Careful, Chen. That sounds dangerously like not caring about achievements."

"Maybe I'm evolving."

"Into what?"

"Someone who occasionally chooses happiness over achievements?"

"Revolutionary." He was teasing, but there was something serious in his eyes. "It looks good on you. Choosing happiness."

Her phone buzzed. Text from her mom: *Sophia, this is unacceptable. Come home immediately.*

She showed Ethan. He pulled out his burner, showed her his screen: *If you're not home by tonight, there will be serious consequences. This is not a game.*

"They're scared," Ethan said quietly. "They can't control us from there."

"What do you think the consequences will be?"

"For me? Probably cutting me off. No college money, no car, no phone. For you?"

"Same, probably. Plus disappointment. So much disappointment."

"Worth it?"

She looked at him—really looked at him. At the exhaustion around his eyes, the tension in his shoulders, the way he was holding her hand like an anchor. This boy who'd chosen her over everything safe and planned.

"Worth it," she confirmed.

They finished lunch and she headed back to the arena. Her first match at three was straightforward—she won 21-15, 21-12. The girl from Saskatchewan never had a chance. Sophia was playing with unusual focus, like she had something to prove.

Ethan watched from the back row, baseball cap still low. But she knew he was there. Could feel his presence like gravity.

Her second match at six was harder. The girl from Ontario had beaten Sophia before, knew her patterns. First game went to her opponent 21-18. But Sophia found another gear in the second game, won 21-14. The third game was a battle, every point fought for. When Sophia finally won 21-19, she nearly collapsed from exhaustion.

She'd made semifinals. Tomorrow—if the tournament happened.

When she found Ethan after showering and changing, he was standing by the windows watching the storm.

"It's getting bad," he said.

She could barely see the parking lot through the snow. Wind howled against the building.

"They just sent an email," she said, checking her phone. "Tournament postponed until further notice. They'll reassess in the morning."

"So we're stuck here."

"Yeah."

They looked at each other, the weight of that settling between them. Stuck in Grand Forks. In a hotel. Together.

"Come on," Ethan said. "Let's get dinner before everything closes."

They found an Italian place downtown still open despite the weather. The owner looked at them like they were crazy for being out, but served them anyway. They got pasta and terrible wine—Ethan's fake ID worked, barely—and sat by the window watching the world disappear under white.

"This is surreal," Sophia said, twirling linguine.

"Which part?"

"All of it. Being here. With you. Our parents freaking out somewhere. This storm literally trapping us."

"Feels like the universe is giving us a gift."

"Or testing us."

"Maybe both."

They talked about everything and nothing. College dreams (both wanted to study multiple things). Favorite books (she loved mysteries, he loved science fiction). Places they wanted to travel (everywhere, together). The conversation felt different than their usual stolen moments—unhurried, expansive, real.

"Can I ask you something?" Sophia said as they shared tiramisu.

"Anything."

"When you think about the future—like really think about it—what do you see?"

He was quiet for a long moment. "Honestly? I can't see past next week. Prep school feels like this wall I'm heading toward, and I can't see over it."

"Nothing?"

"Well. I see you." He met her eyes. "Whatever else happens, I see you in my future. Is that crazy?"

"We're seventeen."

"So?"

"So everyone says teenage love doesn't last."

"Everyone says a lot of things." He reached across the table, traced patterns on her hand. "I don't care what everyone says. I know what I feel."

"What if it changes? What if distance changes us?"

"Then it changes. But right now, in this moment, I love you. And I'm choosing to believe that matters."

The owner came over, apologetic. "I'm sorry, kids, but I need to close. The storm is getting worse."

They paid—Ethan insisted, despite Sophia's protests—and stepped outside into the blizzard.

The world had transformed. Snow fell so thick they could barely see across the street. Wind drove it sideways, stinging their faces. They struggled back to Ethan's truck, had to brush a foot of snow off before they could even find the door handles.

The drive back to the hotel was terrifying. Even with four-wheel drive, the truck slid constantly. Visibility was maybe ten feet. What should have been a five-minute drive took twenty, Ethan white-knuckling the steering wheel the whole way.

When they finally made it to the Holiday Inn parking lot, they sat for a moment, breathing hard.

"That was—"

"Yeah."

"We're definitely stuck here now."

"Yeah."

They looked at each other in the dim cab light. Stuck. Together. Alone.

"We should go in," Sophia said.

"We should."

Neither moved.

"Sophia—"

"I know. I'm nervous too."

"I don't want you to think—I mean, I got the room because we needed somewhere to stay, not because I expected—"

"I know." She leaned across the console, kissed him softly. "I trust you. And I trust myself. Whatever happens or doesn't happen, we're choosing it together. Okay?"

"Okay."

They ran through the blizzard to the hotel entrance, laughing and gasping as snow immediately soaked through their clothes. The lobby was warm and bright, a shocking contrast to the violence outside.

The desk clerk looked up. "You kids just get in?"

"Just made it," Ethan confirmed.

"You're lucky. Highway's closing. Nobody's going anywhere until this passes."

They took the elevator to the second floor. The hallway was eerily quiet—most guests had clearly fled before the storm. When Ethan unlocked room 247, Sophia felt her heart rate spike.

It was just a room. Two double beds. A TV. A window showing nothing but white.

But it was also their room. Their space. No parents, no friends, no one watching.

"I can sleep on the floor," Ethan offered immediately.

"There are two beds."

"Right. Yeah. Two beds."

They stood awkwardly in the doorway until Sophia laughed. "We're being ridiculous."

"We are."

"We've literally slept in the same bed before."

"That was different."

"Why?"

"Because..." He ran a hand through his snow-damp hair. "Because we hadn't said I love you yet. Because we weren't alone in a hotel room in a different country while our parents think we're dead. Because everything feels more... possible now."

She knew exactly what he meant. The air between them felt charged, full of potential energy waiting to spark.

"Let's just... see what happens," she said. "No pressure. No expectations. Just us."

"Just us," he agreed.

They changed into dry clothes—separately, Sophia in the bathroom—and settled on one of the beds to watch the weather report. The storm was even worse than predicted. Two feet of snow expected. Roads closed indefinitely.

"My parents are going to lose their minds," Sophia said, checking her phone. Twelve missed calls. Twenty-three texts. Increasingly frantic voicemails.

"Mine too." Ethan showed her his burner. "My dad actually used all caps. I've never seen him use all caps."

"Should we tell them we're okay?"

"They know we're okay. If we weren't, the police would have called by now."

"That's morbid."

"But true."

She leaned against his shoulder, and he put his arm around her. On TV, the weather person was gesturing at a massive swirl of white covering three states.

"Historic storm," the weather person said. "Possibly the worst in a decade."

"We have terrible timing," Sophia murmured.

"Or perfect timing," Ethan countered. "Depending on how you look at it."

She tilted her head to look at him. "How are you looking at it?"

"Like we got given a gift. Time. No one can get to us. No one can make us leave. For however long this storm lasts, we're free."

"Free," she repeated, tasting the word.

"Free to be ourselves. To figure out what we actually want. To just... exist together."

"That sounds perfect."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They stayed like that for a while, watching the storm rage outside, safe in their little bubble of warmth and possibility. And Sophia thought: This is it. This is what choosing yourself feels like. Terrifying and perfect and absolutely worth whatever comes next.
