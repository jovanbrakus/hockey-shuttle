# CHAPTER 1: THE DECISION

## JANUARY 2-4, JUNIOR YEAR

The envelope sat on Sophia's desk like an accusation.

Cream-colored. Heavy paper. Robert Price's law firm embossed in the corner. Twenty-four hours ago, he'd handed it to her with that practiced smile, that certainty that she'd make the "smart choice."

MIT. Full ride. Her future guaranteed.

Her integrity sold.

Sophia sat at her desk at 2:47 AM on January 3rd, unable to sleep. The letter had kept her up all night, its presence filling her room like smoke. She'd read it twelve times. Each time, the words became more suffocating:

*Dear Ms. Chen,*

*The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is pleased to extend this special early admission opportunity...*

Special. That's what Robert had called it. A special arrangement through his connections. Special because she was special—smart enough for MIT, talented enough for nationals, mature enough to understand what was really being offered.

A bribe wrapped in prestige.

She picked up the envelope again. Her hands weren't shaking anymore. They'd stopped shaking around midnight when the anger finally overtook the confusion.

Outside her window, Winnipeg slept under fresh snow. The streetlight caught ice crystals in the air, making everything sparkle. Beautiful and cold. Like the future being offered to her—gleaming and frozen.

Her phone sat silent on her nightstand. She'd wanted to call Ethan all evening, but what would she say? *Your father tried to buy me off with my dream school?* He'd tell her to take it. Of course he would. He'd insist she couldn't throw away MIT for him, that he wasn't worth that sacrifice.

But that was the thing—this wasn't about him. Not really.

This was about her.

About who she was. Who she wanted to be.

Sophia looked at the letter one more time. The MIT crest at the top. The numbers that would make her parents weep with joy—full tuition, room and board, even a book stipend. Everything she'd worked for, handed to her on heavy cream paper.

All she had to do was take it. Accept the early admission. Lock in her future.

And implicitly agree to stay away from Robert Price's son.

She stood up, letter in hand, and walked to her window. The Prices lived six blocks away. Was Ethan awake too? Was he thinking about her? Or was he sleeping peacefully, unaware that his father was trying to orchestrate their lives like a business deal?

The paper was thick. Expensive. It took effort to tear.

The first rip was the hardest—straight through the MIT crest. The sound was louder than she expected in the 3 AM quiet. She looked at the two halves in her hands, waiting to feel regret.

Instead, she felt fury.

She tore again. And again. Methodically destroying Robert Price's perfect solution. The guarantee became confetti, falling onto her desk like snow. Each piece felt like reclaiming something—her choice, her future, herself.

"I choose me," she whispered to her empty room. "And choosing me means choosing us."

Her hands were steady now. Her breathing even. For the first time in twenty-four hours, she felt like she could actually breathe.

She gathered the pieces, dozens of them, and dropped them in her trash can. Tomorrow—later today—she'd have to face the consequences. Tell her parents she was keeping her options open. Weather their disappointment. But right now, at 3:02 AM, she'd made her choice.

Not the smart choice. Not the safe choice.

Her choice.

She climbed back into bed, exhausted but clear. Her phone buzzed. Text from Ethan: *Can't sleep. Thinking about you.*

She stared at it, thumb hovering over the keyboard. She could tell him now. Wake him up, confess everything. But that would make it about him, and it wasn't. This was her decision, her integrity, her life.

Instead, she typed: *Same. See you tomorrow?*

*Always.*

She set the phone down and closed her eyes. In six hours, she'd have to wake up and start dealing with reality. But for now, she'd made her choice. The envelope was in pieces. Her future was uncertain.

And somehow, that felt exactly right.

---

The morning came too soon.

Sophia woke to her alarm at 7:00, feeling like she'd barely slept. But when she saw the torn paper in her trash can, the fog of exhaustion lifted. She'd really done it. Rejected MIT. Rejected Robert Price's manipulation.

She dressed carefully—jeans, her favorite sweater, hair pulled back. Armor for the conversation ahead. Downstairs, she could hear her parents in the kitchen, the familiar rhythm of their morning routine. Coffee brewing. CBC Radio playing quietly. Her father's tablet probably open to the news.

Normal Thursday morning. About to become anything but.

She went downstairs, each step deliberate. Her mother stood at the stove making congee, her father at the table reading his tablet. They looked up when she entered, mild morning greetings that felt like the last moment before everything changed.

"Good morning," her mother said. "You want congee or toast?"

"Toast is fine."

Her father glanced up. "You have badminton today?"

"Yeah. After school."

Normal. So normal. Sophia sat down, gathering courage. The torn letter upstairs felt like it was broadcasting its destruction through the floor.

"I need to tell you something," she said.

Both parents looked up. Her mother's expression immediately shifted to concern. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. I just—I've made a decision about college."

Her father set down his tablet completely. "What decision?"

"I'm not doing early admission anywhere. I want to apply regular decision to multiple schools and see what happens."

The silence was deafening.

"But you have offers," her mother said carefully. "Opportunities that won't come again."

"I know. But I'm seventeen. I don't know if I want to commit to engineering. I don't know if I want to be in Boston. I need more time to figure it out."

"Figure what out?" Her father's voice was genuinely confused. "MIT is the best engineering school in the world. What is there to figure out?"

"Maybe I don't want to do engineering."

The words fell like bombs. Her parents exchanged looks—the kind of wordless communication that came from twenty years of marriage.

"Is this about that boy?" her mother asked, voice dangerously quiet. "The Price boy?"

Sophia's stomach clenched, but she kept her voice steady. "This is about me. About what I want for my future."

"Your future was set," her father said. "MIT. Engineering. Success. Why would you throw that away for uncertainty?"

"Because it's my uncertainty to choose."

Her mother stood abruptly, walking to the sink. Her back was rigid, her movements sharp. "You're making a terrible mistake."

"Maybe. But it's my mistake to make."

"Sophia—" her father started.

"I know you're disappointed. I know you wanted MIT for me. But I can't accept something just because it looks perfect on paper. I have to actually want it."

"And you don't want MIT?" Her mother turned around, disbelief clear on her face.

"I don't know what I want. That's what I'm trying to tell you. And committing to something I'm not sure about feels worse than waiting to figure it out."

The kitchen fell silent except for the coffee maker's gurgling. Sophia's toast popped up, but nobody moved to get it.

Finally, her mother said, "This is because of him. The Price boy. You're throwing away your future for teenage romance."

"No," Sophia said firmly. "I'm claiming my future. For me."

But even as she said it, she knew her morning wasn't over. She still had to tell Ethan about the offer. About what she'd chosen. About what his father had tried to do.

---

She met Ethan at their bench in Kildonan Park at noon, during lunch break. He was already there when she arrived, shoulders hunched against the cold, breath fogging in the January air.

"Hey," he said, standing when he saw her. "You sounded weird in your text. Everything okay?"

She sat down, and he sat beside her. The frozen pond stretched out before them, white and still. She could see kids skating in the distance, their laughter carrying on the wind.

"I need to tell you something," she said.

His body tensed. "Okay."

"Your father came to my house. Two days ago. January second."

Ethan went very still. "What?"

"He brought a letter. From MIT. Full ride, early admission, everything arranged through his connections." She took a shaky breath. "He offered me my dream school if I would accept it and... implicitly stay away from you."

The color drained from Ethan's face. "He tried to bribe you."

"Yeah."

"And you..." He couldn't finish the sentence.

"I tore it up. This morning. Three AM. I tore it into pieces and threw it away."

Ethan stared at her. His mouth opened, closed, opened again. "Sophia, that was MIT. That was—that was everything."

"No. It was his version of everything. His manipulation disguised as opportunity."

"But MIT—"

"I can still apply regular decision. If I get in on my own merit, great. But I won't take his bribe."

"It wasn't about the bribe, it was about your future—"

"Ethan." She grabbed his hands, forcing him to look at her. "My future. My choice. And I chose not to be manipulated. I chose not to let your father control my life the way he controls yours."

His hands were shaking in hers. "You gave up MIT for me."

"No. I gave up his MIT for me. Because accepting it would mean accepting that our relationship is something shameful that needs to be bought off. And it's not. We're not."

He pulled his hands free and stood up, pacing in front of the bench. "This is insane. You can't—you can't throw away MIT because of me."

"I didn't. I threw it away because it was wrong. Because it was a bribe. Because I refuse to be bought."

"My father will—" He stopped, running his hands through his hair. "God, he'll be furious."

"He already knows. He has to know by now. The deadline was this morning."

Ethan's phone buzzed. He looked at it, and his face went white. "I have to go. Team meeting. But Sophia—"

"I don't regret it," she said firmly. "Whatever happens next, I don't regret choosing myself."

He looked at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he crossed to her in two steps, pulled her up, and kissed her. Hard, desperate, tasting like coffee and winter air.

"You're incredible," he said against her mouth. "And insane. And I—" He pulled back. "I have to go. But we're talking about this later."

He ran toward the parking lot, leaving her standing by the bench. Her phone buzzed. Text from him already: *My dad just called. Team meeting is a lie. He knows about MIT. Coming to get me. This is about to get bad.*

Sophia's stomach dropped. She typed back: *I'm sorry.*

*Don't be. You chose you. That's everything.*

But she could feel it—the storm that was coming. Robert Price didn't lose. Ever. And she'd just declared war.

---

The storm hit at 4:30 PM.

Sophia was at badminton practice when Coach Martinez called her over. "Your father is here. Says it's a family emergency."

Her father never picked her up from practice. Never.

She grabbed her bag and found him in the lobby, his face grim. "We need to go home. Now."

"What's wrong?"

"Robert Price is at our house. With his lawyer."

The drive home was silent. Sophia's mind raced. His lawyer? What did that mean? What could Robert do legally?

They pulled into the driveway to find a black Mercedes and an unfamiliar sedan. Inside, her mother sat in the living room across from Robert Price and a woman in a severe suit. Everyone turned when they entered.

"Sophia," Robert said, standing. His voice was calm, controlled. Nothing like the warm uncle figure who'd offered her MIT. "We need to discuss the decision you made this morning."

"There's nothing to discuss. I declined your offer."

"You destroyed a guaranteed acceptance to MIT. Do you understand what you've thrown away?"

"I understand perfectly."

The lawyer spoke up. "Miss Chen, the arrangement Mr. Price made required significant financial commitments and favors. Your rejection at this late stage has consequences."

"What consequences?" Sophia's father asked. "She's seventeen. She can't be held to some backroom deal she didn't even sign."

"No legal consequences," Robert said. "But professional ones. Mr. Chen, you work for Richardson Engineering, correct? They're bidding on the Portage Avenue development? The one my firm is consulting on?"

The threat was subtle but clear. Sophia's father's face darkened. "Are you threatening my job?"

"I'm explaining reality. Choices have consequences. Your daughter made a choice. Now your family lives with those consequences."

"Get out," Sophia's mother said quietly. "Get out of our house."

Robert stood, straightening his suit. "I tried to help your daughter. Remember that. I offered her a future, and she threw it in my face. Whatever happens next is on her."

He left, his lawyer following. The house felt poisoned by their presence.

"Is it true?" her mother asked, turning to Sophia. "You rejected MIT? For that boy?"

"For myself," Sophia said, exhausted by having to keep explaining this. "I rejected it for myself."

Her phone buzzed. Text from Ethan: *They moved my departure. Prep school wants me Jan 7. Three days. My dad is sending me away in THREE DAYS.*

The room spun. Three days. They were accelerating everything, pulling him away before—

"I have to go," she said.

"You're not going anywhere," her father said. "We need to discuss what just happened."

"Later. Please. I need—"

"To see him?" Her mother's voice was sharp. "The boy whose father just threatened our family?"

"He's not his father."

"No, but he's the reason his father was here."

"That's not—" Sophia stopped. There was no point arguing. They'd made up their minds.

"You're grounded," her father said. "School and badminton only. No phone after eight PM. No seeing that boy."

"Dad—"

"This is not a discussion. You made your choice. Now we make ours."

Sophia stared at them—her parents, who'd always supported her, always trusted her. Now looking at her like she was a stranger who'd brought danger to their door.

"Fine," she said quietly. "Ground me. Take my phone. It doesn't change anything."

She went upstairs, closed her door, and immediately texted Ethan: *They moved your departure? When?*

*January 7. My last game is tomorrow. They're shipping me out Sunday.*

*That's the same weekend as my nationals.*

There was a pause. Then: *I know. I'm driving you.*

*Ethan, you can't—*

*I'm driving you. We get three days together. They can't take that.*

*Your parents will never allow it.*

*I'm eighteen. I'm taking my truck. I'm driving you to nationals. End of discussion.*

Sophia stared at the text. He was really going to do it. Defy his parents completely. For three days together.

*Okay.*

*Okay?*

*Yeah. Drive me.*

*I'll pick you up Friday morning. 6 AM. Tell your parents you're taking the team bus.*

It was insane. It was dangerous. It was definitely going to make everything worse.

*I'll be ready.*

*Sophia?*

*Yeah?*

*You tore up MIT. For real.*

*Yeah.*

*You're the bravest person I know.*

*Or the stupidest.*

*Same thing sometimes.*

She smiled despite everything. Despite Robert's threats, her parents' disappointment, the countdown that had just started—three days until he left.

But first, three days together. On the road. Away from everyone.

A knock on her door. "Sophia?" Her mother's voice. "Dinner."

"Coming."

She put her phone down, looked at the trash can where the MIT letter lay in pieces. No regrets. Whatever came next, no regrets.

She'd chosen herself.

And choosing herself meant choosing him.

Three days to prove it was worth it.

---

Ethan's last home game was everything and nothing at once.

Sophia sat in section 114 with Maya, watching him play with desperate brilliance. Every rush, every shot, every hit had an edge to it—like he was trying to fit a lifetime of hockey into sixty minutes.

The Winnipeg Falcons destroyed the Brandon Wheat Kings 8-2. Ethan had four goals and two assists. A career night. A goodbye night.

"He's playing like someone lit him on fire," Maya said.

"Close enough," Sophia murmured.

The crowd was electric. Everyone knew this was Ethan Price's last game before Michigan. Scouts were in the stands. His parents in their usual seats, Robert looking satisfied, Caroline taking photos.

But Ethan kept looking up at section 114. Finding her. Making sure she was there.

During the second intermission, Maya nudged her. "Your phone."

Text from unknown number: *After the game. Parking lot. Need to talk. - E*

He'd gotten a burner phone already.

The third period was poetry and violence. Ethan played like he was saying goodbye to more than just his team—like he was saying goodbye to this version of himself. The crowd gave him a standing ovation when he scored his fourth goal. His teammates mobbed him. And Sophia watched from above, memorizing everything, knowing this might be the last time she saw him play for months.

When the final buzzer sounded, the crowd erupted. The announcer's voice boomed: "Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it one more time for number seventeen, Ethan Price!"

The arena shook with applause. Ethan raised his stick, did a lap, his teammates joining him. Jordan Nakamura was openly crying, not even trying to hide it.

"Come on," Sophia said to Maya. "Parking lot."

They fought through the crowds, out into the freezing night. The parking lot was chaos—fans, parents, players starting to emerge. Sophia found a spot near the back, watching for him.

He came out twenty minutes later, hair still wet from his shower, hockey bag over his shoulder. His parents were nowhere to be seen—probably doing their victory lap with the other hockey parents inside.

"Hey," he said, approaching them.

"Hey." She wanted to hug him but was aware of all the people around. "You played amazing."

"Thanks." He looked exhausted, wrung out. "Maya, can I talk to Sophia alone for a second?"

Maya looked between them. "I'll be in my car. With the heater on. Like a smart person." She walked away, leaving them standing in the freezing parking lot.

"Three days," Ethan said as soon as Maya was out of earshot. "We leave in eight hours."

"Your parents—"

"Think I'm driving Jordan to his cabin for the weekend. He's covering for me."

"My parents think I'm on the team bus."

"So we're both lying."

"Yeah."

They stood there, breath fogging between them, the weight of what they were about to do settling like snow.

"There's a blizzard warning," he said. "For Saturday. We might get stuck."

"Where?"

"North Dakota probably. If we're lucky, we'll make it to Grand Forks before it hits."

"And if we're not lucky?"

He shrugged. "Then we get stuck somewhere else. Together."

The way he said "together" made her stomach flip.

"Ethan—"

"I know it's crazy. I know it's going to make everything worse. But I don't care anymore. They're taking everything anyway. College, hockey, my phone, my life—they're controlling all of it. But not this. Not these three days. These are ours."

His voice cracked on the last word. Sophia stepped closer, not caring who might see.

"Six AM?" she confirmed.

"I'll be at the end of your street. Don't come out until you see my headlights flash."

"Okay."

"Bring warm clothes. The storm could be bad."

"Okay."

"And Sophia?" He looked at her, his face young and desperate and beautiful. "Thank you. For choosing this. Choosing us."

"Always," she said.

His parents emerged from the arena, Robert calling his name. Ethan grabbed his bag.

"Six AM," he said once more.

"I'll be ready."

He walked toward his parents, toward the Mercedes, toward his last two nights in his childhood home. And Sophia stood in the parking lot, watching him go, knowing that in eight hours everything would change.

Maya returned, linking their arms. "So you're really doing this? Running away with him for the weekend?"

"Not running away. Driving to nationals."

"With a stop for what, exactly?"

"I don't know," Sophia admitted. "Whatever three days can hold."

"That's either the most romantic or most destructive thing I've ever heard."

"Yeah," Sophia agreed. "Probably both."

They walked to Maya's car, and Sophia looked back once at the arena, lit up against the dark sky. Somewhere in there, Robert and Caroline Price were probably holding court, accepting congratulations on their son's success, planning his NHL future.

They had no idea their son was about to steal three days for himself.

No idea their perfect plan was about to hit a blizzard.

---

Sophia barely slept.

She packed and repacked her competition bag. Badminton gear, warm clothes, phone charger, journal. The essentials for nationals. Nothing that would indicate she was planning anything else.

At 2 AM, her phone buzzed. The unknown number—Ethan's burner.

*Can't sleep. Keep thinking about tomorrow.*

*Same. Scared?*

*Terrified. You?*

*Terrified. But also... ready?*

*Yeah. Ready to choose something. Even if it's wrong.*

*What if it's right?*

*Then we get three perfect days.*

*And after?*

*After doesn't exist yet. Only tomorrow.*

She smiled in the dark. *Six AM.*

*Five hours and forty-three minutes. But who's counting.*

*Get some sleep. Long drive tomorrow.*

*Can't. Too busy memorizing everything I want to say to you.*

*Say it tomorrow. We'll have time.*

*Three days of time.*

*Three days of choosing us.*

*Worth it. Whatever happens after, worth it.*

She set her phone down and stared at her ceiling. In six hours, she'd walk out of this house with a lie. Drive away with a boy her parents had forbidden her to see. Head straight into a blizzard that everyone was warning about.

It was destructive. Dangerous. Definitely going to have consequences.

But for the first time since Robert Price had shown up with his MIT bribe, she felt like she could breathe. Because this—this choice, this risk, this leap into uncertainty—this was hers.

Not her parents'. Not Robert's. Not even Ethan's.

Hers.

She closed her eyes and tried to sleep, knowing that tomorrow would begin the three most important days of her seventeen years.

Three days to prove that choosing yourself was worth any consequence.

Three days to prove that love was worth the storm.

---

At 5:45 AM on January 5th, Sophia slipped out of her house into the pre-dawn darkness.

The street was silent, fresh snow muffling everything. Her competition bag over her shoulder, her phone in her pocket, her heart hammering against her ribs.

At the end of the block, headlights flashed once.

Ethan's truck.

She walked toward it, each step taking her further from the safe, predictable life she'd known. When she reached the passenger door, he leaned over to open it.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi."

She climbed in, stowed her bag, buckled her seatbelt. The truck was warm, the radio playing quietly. Ethan looked exhausted but determined, his hands gripping the steering wheel.

"Ready?" he asked.

She looked back at her street, her house dark and sleeping, her parents unaware their daughter had just chosen chaos over control.

"Ready."

He put the truck in drive, and they pulled away into the darkness. The radio weather report played softly: "Blizzard warning remains in effect for southern Manitoba and northern North Dakota, beginning Friday evening through Sunday morning. Travel not recommended."

Ethan turned it off.

"No going back now," he said.

"No going back," she agreed.

They drove south toward Highway 75, toward the border, toward North Dakota and the storm everyone could see coming. In the side mirror, Sophia watched Winnipeg disappear behind them, streetlight by streetlight, until there was nothing but darkness and the road ahead.

Three days.

Starting now.
