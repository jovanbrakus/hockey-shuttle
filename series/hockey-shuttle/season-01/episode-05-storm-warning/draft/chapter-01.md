# CHAPTER 1: THE DECISION

## JANUARY 2-4, JUNIOR YEAR

The envelope sat on Sophia's desk like a dare.

She'd been staring at it for twenty minutes, watching winter sunrise bleed pale light across her bedroom walls. Her alarm hadn't gone off yet. She'd woken naturally at seven, body and brain too wired for sleep, and the first thing she'd seen was that cream-colored paper with Robert Price's law firm return address.

The letter that could solve everything.

The letter that would destroy everything.

She picked it up. Heavy paper, expensive. Inside: a guarantee. MIT. Full ride. Her parents' pride restored. The next twelve years mapped out in a way that made sense to everyone who mattered.

Everyone except her.

Sophia thought about last night. Ethan's truck in the empty parking lot. His face when she'd said she wasn't sure about MIT. The way he'd looked at her—not disappointed, not pressured, just watching. Waiting for her to choose.

*I want you to choose what you want. Not what makes sense. Not what everyone expects. What you actually want.*

She stood up, walked to her desk, and before she could second-guess herself, she tore the envelope in half.

The sound was surprisingly loud in the quiet morning. Crisp, final.

She tore it again. And again. Until Robert Price's guarantee was confetti in her hands, pieces falling onto her desk like snow.

Her hands were shaking.

Her chest felt tight.

But underneath the fear, something else: relief.

"I chose me," she whispered to her empty room. "And choosing me meant choosing us."

Her phone buzzed. Text from Ethan: *You awake?*

She looked at the torn paper on her desk, then typed back: *Yeah. I did something.*

Three dots appeared immediately. Then: *Good something or bad something?*

*I think good. I'll tell you later.*

*Okay. Call you after practice?*

*Yeah.*

She set her phone down and looked at the mess on her desk. No taking it back now. She'd rejected MIT. She'd rejected the easy path. She'd rejected her parents' certainty and Robert Price's manipulation.

She'd chosen chaos. She'd chosen possibility. She'd chosen Ethan.

Now she just had to tell her parents.

---

The Chen kitchen smelled like coffee and congee. Her mother stood at the stove, her father at the table reading news on his tablet. Normal Thursday morning. Sophia slid into her usual chair.

"Good morning," her mother said, not turning around. "You want rice or toast?"

"Toast is fine."

Her father glanced up. "You have badminton today?"

"Yeah. Practice after school."

He nodded and returned to his tablet. Her mother brought toast and sat down with her own coffee. They ate in comfortable silence for a few minutes. Sophia tried to organize her thoughts.

"I need to tell you something," she said finally.

Both parents looked up. Her mother's expression shifted immediately to concern. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. I just—I've been thinking about college. About MIT."

Her father set down his tablet. "You've been thinking about MIT?"

"Yeah." She took a breath. "And I decided I want to keep my options open. Apply to more schools. Not commit to anything early."

Silence.

Her mother's face went very still. "What does that mean, exactly?"

"It means I'm not doing early decision. I want to apply regular to a bunch of schools and see what happens."

"But MIT is guaranteed," her father said, confusion clear in his voice. "Why would you risk that?"

"Because I'm not sure it's what I want."

Her mother set down her coffee carefully. "Sophia. We've talked about this. MIT is—"

"I know what MIT is. I know it's amazing. But I'm seventeen. I don't know if I want to commit to engineering. I don't know if I want to be in Boston. I just—I want more time to figure it out."

"You have plenty of time," her mother said. "You have four years of MIT to figure out what kind of engineering you want to do."

"That's not what I mean." Sophia's hands tightened around her toast. "I mean maybe I don't want to do engineering at all."

Her father blinked. "Then what would you study?"

"I don't know yet. That's the point."

Her mother stood abruptly, walking to the sink. Her back was rigid. "This is about that boy, isn't it?"

Sophia's stomach dropped. "What boy?"

"The Price boy. The hockey player. Your father told me you've been spending time with him."

Sophia glared at her father, who had the grace to look uncomfortable. "I mentioned I saw you getting coffee," he said quietly.

"This isn't about Ethan," Sophia said, even though it was partly about Ethan, even though everything was connected now. "This is about me. About what I want."

Her mother turned around. Her face was carefully neutral, but Sophia could see the disappointment underneath. "What you want. At seventeen. Based on what, exactly? A feeling?"

"Based on the fact that I'm not sure. And committing to something I'm not sure about seems worse than waiting to figure it out."

"You're throwing away a guarantee," her father said. "Do you understand how rare that is? How many students would kill for that opportunity?"

"I know. I do know that. But it doesn't feel right."

"It doesn't feel right," her mother repeated. The words were flat, edged with something that might have been anger or might have been hurt. "Sophia, feelings change. Opportunities like MIT don't come twice."

"Maybe I'll get in regular decision. Maybe I'll get in somewhere better."

"Or maybe you'll get in nowhere," her mother said sharply, "because you threw away your guarantee chasing a feeling."

Silence fell over the kitchen, heavy and awful. Sophia stared at her toast. Her appetite was completely gone.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly. "I know you wanted this for me. But I have to make my own choice."

Her mother didn't answer. Just turned back to the sink, started washing dishes that were already clean. Her father sighed and picked up his tablet again, but Sophia could tell he wasn't reading anymore.

She finished her toast in silence, put her plate in the sink, and went upstairs to get ready for school. In her bedroom, the torn envelope was still scattered across her desk. She swept it into the trash.

No going back now.

---

School was a blur of classes and assignments Sophia couldn't focus on. She kept checking her phone, waiting for Ethan to call. He didn't—practice ran late, then he had a team meeting. By the time badminton practice ended at five, she still hadn't heard from him.

She was walking to her car when her phone finally rang.

"Hey," she answered, climbing into the driver's seat.

"Hey." His voice sounded wrong. Tight. "Can I come over?"

Her stomach twisted. "What's wrong?"

"I just—I need to talk to you. In person."

"Yeah. Yeah, of course. My parents are home though."

"That's fine. I'll meet you at the park?"

Their park. Their bench. "Okay. Twenty minutes?"

"I'm leaving now."

He hung up before she could say anything else. Sophia sat in her car, engine running, a cold feeling spreading through her chest.

Something was very wrong.

---

Ethan's truck was already there when she arrived. He was sitting on their bench, staring out at the frozen pond. January twilight turned everything blue and gray. Sophia parked and walked over, her breath fogging in the cold air.

He looked up when she approached. His face was pale, his expression devastated.

"What happened?" she asked, sitting down beside him.

He didn't answer right away. Just looked at her like he was memorizing her face. Finally he said, "They moved it up."

"Moved what up?"

"Prep school. I'm leaving January seventh."

The world tilted. "What? That's—that's less than a week."

"Five days," he said. His voice was hollow. "They called this morning. Apparently there's a spot open because another player got injured and is out for the season. They want me there for second semester. It starts January eighth."

"But—you were supposed to have until the end of the month."

"I know."

Sophia's throat was tight. Five days. Not even a full week. "What did you say?"

"What could I say? My dad already accepted. Already paid the tuition for the semester. It's done."

"You're eighteen. You could refuse."

He laughed, bitter. "With what money? They're paying for everything. College, training, everything. If I refuse this, I refuse all of it."

"So you'd—what? Work? Take a gap year?"

"And do what? I've trained for hockey my entire life. I don't have anything else."

The words hung between them. Sophia wanted to argue, wanted to say he was brilliant at everything, wanted to remind him about astrophysics and art museums and the way his mind worked. But she also understood what he was saying. His entire identity was built on hockey. Without that, who was he?

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

He finally looked at her. Really looked at her. "What did you do this morning? You said you did something."

She almost didn't want to tell him. It felt wrong now, when his world was falling apart. But she'd already lied by omission too much. "I rejected MIT."

His eyes widened. "You what?"

"I tore up the letter. I'm not doing early decision. I'm applying regular to a bunch of schools."

"Sophia—"

"I know. My parents are furious. But I couldn't—" Her voice cracked. "I couldn't take it. It didn't feel right."

He stared at her. Then, slowly, he started to laugh. It wasn't a happy sound. "So we're both choosing chaos."

"I guess so."

"Five days," he said again. "We have five days."

Sophia reached for his hand. His fingers were cold. "What do you want to do with them?"

He turned to face her fully. "Your badminton nationals. When are they?"

"January fifth through seventh. In Grand Forks."

"North Dakota?"

"Yeah."

Something shifted in his expression. "I'm driving you."

"Ethan—"

"No. Listen. I'm leaving on the seventh anyway. Your tournament is the fifth through the seventh. I'll drive you down, watch you compete, and we'll drive back together. Three days together. It's perfect."

"Your parents will never let you."

"I'm not asking permission." His voice was suddenly fierce. "I'm eighteen. I have a car. I have three days before my life becomes what they planned. I'm taking them."

"They'll be furious."

"Let them be furious. What are they going to do, send me to prep school early?" His mouth twisted. "I'm already going."

Sophia's heart was pounding. "We'd be gone for three days."

"Yeah."

"They'd definitely find out."

"Yeah."

"It would make everything worse."

"I don't care." He squeezed her hand. "Do you want me to drive you or not?"

She should say no. She should be responsible, should think about consequences, should protect what little peace they had left. But when she looked at him—at his desperate, determined face—she couldn't.

"Yes," she said. "Yes, I want you to drive me."

He pulled her into a hug, fast and hard. His face pressed into her hair. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not being reasonable. For not telling me to follow the plan. For just—for choosing this."

She hugged him back, breathing him in. "Three days."

"Three days." He pulled back just enough to look at her. "We'll tell them we're leaving Friday morning. Tournament logistics. We'll be back Sunday night."

"What about your goodbye stuff? Your team?"

"Last home game is tomorrow night. After that—" He shrugged. "I don't need a party. I just need time with you."

Sophia's eyes stung. "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Let's do it."

He kissed her then, cold lips and warm breath and the taste of desperation. When they broke apart, he was smiling—a real smile, the first she'd seen since she'd arrived.

"We're really doing this," he said.

"We're really doing this."

He pulled out his phone, checked the weather. His smile faded slightly. "There's a storm coming. Late Friday or Saturday."

"How bad?"

"Blizzard warning. But it might miss Grand Forks. And even if it doesn't, we'll just wait it out."

Sophia looked at his phone screen, at the swirling weather map. Something cold touched her spine. "Maybe we should wait. Drive down after the storm."

"Can't. I have to leave Sunday night. This is the only window." He pocketed his phone and took her hand again. "Hey. We've lived in Manitoba our whole lives. We know snow. It'll be fine."

She wanted to believe him. "Okay."

"Okay." He checked the time. "I should go. Team dinner tonight, then early practice tomorrow. But tomorrow night—last home game. You'll be there?"

"Yeah. Of course."

"Sit in your usual spot. I want to know where you are."

"I will."

They stood, reluctant to separate. Ethan pulled her into one more hug. "We're going to be okay," he said into her hair. "Five days. We'll make them count."

Sophia nodded against his chest, not trusting her voice. She wanted to believe him. She wanted to believe five days would be enough, that three days on the road would make a difference, that somehow they could survive what was coming.

But the storm warning kept replaying in her mind.

Late Friday or Saturday.

Right when they'd be in North Dakota.

Right when they'd be together.

She pulled back and kissed him one more time. "I'll see you tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," he agreed.

She walked to her car and didn't look back, even though she wanted to. In her rearview mirror, she could see him still standing by the bench, watching her drive away.

Five days until he left.

Three days together on the road.

Two days to figure out how to survive the separation.

One decision that would change everything.

She'd already made it.

---

Ethan's last home game fell on January third, a Friday night at Bell MTS Iceplex. The rink was packed—word had spread that he was leaving for prep school, and everyone wanted to see the Winnipeg Jets' future first-round draft pick play one more time.

Sophia sat in her usual spot with Maya, high in section 114, where she could see the entire ice. Maya had brought a sign that said "GOOD LUCK AT PREP SCHOOL" with a badly drawn hockey stick. She was waving it enthusiastically.

"Think he'll see it?" Maya asked.

"Probably. Though I'm not sure he cares about signs right now."

Maya lowered the sign, giving Sophia a sideways look. "You okay? You've been weird all week."

"I'm fine."

"You're a terrible liar."

Sophia sighed. "He's leaving in four days. I'm allowed to be weird."

"Fair." Maya was quiet for a moment. Then: "Are you going to see him? Before he leaves?"

"Yeah. I'm—" She hesitated. They'd agreed not to tell anyone about the road trip. But Maya was her best friend, and lying felt wrong. "I'm not going to be around this weekend."

"Why not?"

"Badminton nationals. Grand Forks."

"Oh, that's this weekend? I thought that was later."

"No, it's—yeah, it's this weekend."

Maya frowned. "Isn't it usually a team bus situation?"

"Usually. But I'm driving myself this time."

"By yourself?"

"No. A friend is driving me."

Understanding dawned on Maya's face. "Oh my God. Ethan's driving you to North Dakota?"

"Shh," Sophia hissed, glancing around. "Don't—yes. Okay? Yes. But don't tell anyone."

"Do your parents know?"

"They know I'm going to nationals. They don't know who's driving."

"Sophia—"

"I know. I know it's a bad idea. I know there's a storm coming. I know his parents are going to lose their minds. But I don't care." She surprised herself with the vehemence in her voice. "I don't care. We have three days. That's it. Then he's gone until God knows when. So yes, he's driving me to North Dakota, and we're going to pretend for three days that the world isn't falling apart."

Maya stared at her. Then, slowly, she smiled. "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay. I think it's insane, but also kind of romantic. And honestly?" She bumped Sophia's shoulder. "You've never done anything crazy in your life. It's about time."

Sophia laughed despite herself. "This feels plenty crazy."

"This feels necessary," Maya corrected. "Just—be careful, okay? With the storm and everything."

"We will."

The lights dimmed then, and the announcer's voice boomed through the speakers. "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your Winnipeg Falcons!"

The team skated onto the ice, and Sophia's breath caught. Ethan was number seventeen, easy to spot even among the other players. He moved with that particular grace she'd always admired, powerful and controlled. When the team lined up for the anthem, she saw him scanning the crowd.

His eyes found her section.

She raised her hand slightly—not waving, just acknowledging.

He nodded once, barely perceptible.

Then the puck dropped, and he was gone, lost in the flow of the game.

---

He played brilliantly.

It wasn't even close. He scored twice in the first period, assisted on another goal in the second, and completed a hat trick with a beautiful wrist shot in the third. The crowd went insane. Maya screamed herself hoarse. And Sophia watched, memorizing every moment, knowing this might be the last time she saw him play for months.

Maybe longer.

When the final buzzer sounded—Falcons won 6-2—the team mobbed Ethan at center ice. His teammates were hugging him, patting his helmet, clearly emotional. Jordan Nakamura, his defense partner and best friend, had tears streaming down his face.

The announcer came back on. "Ladies and gentlemen, as many of you know, tonight was Ethan Price's last home game before he leaves for prep school in Michigan. Ethan, we wish you the best of luck, and we can't wait to see you in the NHL!"

The crowd erupted in applause. Ethan raised his stick in acknowledgment, then skated to the bench. Sophia watched him disappear into the tunnel.

"Come on," Maya said, standing. "Let's go down to the parking lot."

"He's going to be forever. Team goodbyes and everything."

"So? We'll wait."

They made their way down through the emptying arena and out to the parking lot. It was freezing, well below zero, and Sophia's breath came out in thick clouds. They huddled near Maya's car, stamping their feet to stay warm.

Twenty minutes later, players started emerging. Jordan came out first, saw Sophia, and walked over.

"Hey," he said. His eyes were still red. "You waiting for E?"

"Yeah. If that's okay."

"Yeah, of course." He hesitated. "He's—he's a mess in there. Trying to act like he's fine, but he's not."

Sophia's chest tightened. "I know."

"You guys will keep in touch, right? While he's gone?"

"Yeah. We'll figure it out."

Jordan nodded, looking like he wanted to say more. Finally: "Take care of him this weekend. He needs—" He broke off. "He needs someone who sees him as more than just hockey, you know?"

"I know."

He gave her a quick, hard hug. "See you around, Sophia."

"See you, Jordan."

He walked off to his car. More players filtered out, some of them glancing at Sophia and Maya but not approaching. Sophia recognized Marcus Keller, Ethan's aggressive teammate who'd been at the Halloween party. He gave her an unreadable look as he passed.

Finally, Ethan emerged.

He was still in his team jacket, hockey bag over his shoulder, face exhausted. When he saw Sophia, something in his expression shifted—softened.

"Hey," he said, walking over.

"Hey." She wanted to hug him but was suddenly shy with Maya standing right there. "You played amazing."

"Thanks." He dropped his bag, scrubbed a hand over his face. "That was harder than I thought it would be."

"Saying goodbye?"

"Yeah."

Maya cleared her throat. "I'm going to head out. Sophia, I'll see you when you get back from nationals?"

"Yeah. Thanks for coming."

"Anytime." Maya looked at Ethan. "Good luck at prep school. Don't forget about us Manitoba people."

He smiled tiredly. "Never."

Maya got in her car and drove off, leaving Sophia and Ethan alone in the parking lot. The cold was brutal, but neither of them moved to leave.

"Four days," Ethan said.

"Four days."

"I'm picking you up tomorrow at six AM. Be ready."

"I will be."

He stepped closer, pulling her into a hug despite his bulky jacket and hockey bag. "Thank you for being here tonight."

"Where else would I be?"

He didn't answer, just held her tighter. Over his shoulder, Sophia could see her breath fogging in the air, the ice rink's lights reflecting off the snow, the empty parking lot stretching out around them.

Everything was changing.

Tomorrow they'd leave.

Tomorrow they'd grab three days that didn't belong to them.

Tomorrow the storm would start building, weather and emotion and the future they couldn't control.

But tonight, in the freezing parking lot of Bell MTS Iceplex, they had this: his arms around her, his heartbeat against her cheek, the knowledge that they were choosing each other despite everything.

"Tomorrow," she whispered.

"Tomorrow," he agreed.

And when he finally pulled back to look at her, his eyes were full of something that looked like hope and heartbreak mixed together—the particular expression of someone who knows exactly what they're about to lose.

"Six AM," he said again.

"I'll be ready."

He kissed her forehead, grabbed his bag, and walked to his truck. She watched him drive away, then got in her own car. Her phone buzzed.

Text from Ethan: *Can't sleep. Too excited. Too scared. Is that normal?*

She typed back: *Yeah. Me too.*

*Three days with you. Worth whatever comes after.*

*Yeah. Worth it.*

She drove home through the freezing night, parked in her driveway, and sat for a moment before going inside. Her competition bag was already packed. Her tournament schedule was printed. Her parents thought she was taking the team bus.

In twelve hours, she'd be in Ethan's truck, driving south toward North Dakota.

Toward three days together.

Toward the storm everyone kept warning about.

Toward whatever came next.

She got out of the car and went inside. Her parents were in the living room, watching TV. "How was the game?" her father asked.

"Good. He played well."

"That's nice."

They didn't know. Didn't know she'd rejected MIT, didn't know who was driving her tomorrow, didn't know she was about to make choices that would blow up their careful plans. They thought she was their good daughter, following the path they'd laid out.

Tomorrow they'd start learning otherwise.

Sophia went upstairs, checked her bag one more time, and set three alarms for five-thirty. She tried to sleep but couldn't. Her mind kept racing: highway routes, storm warnings, his face in the parking lot, the feeling of his arms around her.

At three AM, her phone buzzed.

Text from Ethan: *Still awake?*

*Yeah.*

*Nervous?*

*Terrified. You?*

*Same. But also—I don't know. Ready. For the first time in weeks, I feel ready.*

*Ready for what?*

*To choose something for myself. Even if it's just three days. Even if everything falls apart after. At least I chose this.*

Sophia stared at his words, throat tight. Then typed: *Me too. I chose this too.*

*See you in three hours.*

*See you.*

She set her phone down and stared at her dark ceiling. Outside, snow was starting to fall. By tomorrow it would be heavier. By Saturday, if the forecasts were right, it would be a full blizzard.

But they'd be together.

And somehow, that felt like enough.

---

At five-forty-five AM, Sophia's alarms went off. She'd barely slept—maybe two hours total. But when she sat up, she felt strangely energized. Nervous energy, probably. Terror masquerading as excitement.

She dressed quickly: warm layers, her favorite jeans, the hoodie Ethan had lent her back in November that she'd never returned. She grabbed her competition bag and her phone. Downstairs, she left a note on the kitchen counter: *Left early for team bus pickup. Nationals this weekend. Be back Sunday night. Love you.*

Not technically a lie. She would be back Sunday night. She just wouldn't be on the team bus.

She slipped out the front door at five-fifty. The street was dark and silent, snow falling steadily. At the end of the block, headlights flashed once.

Ethan's truck.

Sophia walked toward it, bag over her shoulder, heart pounding so hard she could feel it in her throat. When she reached the passenger door, Ethan leaned over to open it.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey."

She climbed in, stowed her bag in the back. The truck was warm, the radio playing quietly. Ethan looked as exhausted and wired as she felt.

"Ready?" he asked.

Sophia buckled her seatbelt and looked at him—at his tired eyes and determined jaw and the hands gripping the steering wheel like he was holding onto something precious.

"Yeah," she said. "Let's go."

He put the truck in drive, and they pulled away from her street, leaving Winnipeg behind in the pre-dawn darkness. On the radio, the weather report played: "Blizzard warning in effect for southern Manitoba and northern North Dakota, Friday night through Saturday. Travel not recommended."

Ethan turned it off.

Sophia reached across the console and took his hand.

And together, they drove south toward the storm.
