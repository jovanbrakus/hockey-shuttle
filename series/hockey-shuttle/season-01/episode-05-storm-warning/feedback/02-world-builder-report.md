# WORLD-BUILDER REPORT: EPISODE 5 "STORM WARNING"

**Overall Grade**: B+

## Critical Issues

### 1. Travel Time Inaccuracy (CRITICAL)
- **Episode states**: "Four hours" Winnipeg to Grand Forks
- **Actual distance**: 2.5-3 hours (235 km / 146 miles)
- **Fix Required**: Adjust all time references and conversation pacing

### 2. Grand Forks Lacks Personality (IMPORTANT)
- Setting for emotional climax feels generic
- Missing: Specific street names, local details, sensory atmosphere
- **Recommendation**: Add 300-400 words of specific Grand Forks details throughout Chapter 2-3

## Strengths

- ✅ Storm progression realistic for region/season
- ✅ Winter atmosphere authentic
- ✅ Bell MTS Iceplex details accurate
- ✅ Highway 75 corridor correctly described
- ✅ Pembina border crossing appropriate

## Location-Specific Recommendations

### Winnipeg Details
- Add more neighborhood specificity
- Include local cultural markers (Jets references, Tim Hortons culture)
- Weather as constant topic (very Canadian/Manitoban)

### Highway 75 Corridor
- Flat landscape well-described ✓
- Consider adding specific landmarks
- Border crossing could have more symbolic weight

### Grand Forks
**Current**: Generic hotel, generic restaurant, generic arena
**Needs**: 
- Alerus Center specific details
- Downtown Grand Forks character
- North Dakota cultural markers
- University presence (UND)

### Motel Room Setting
- Good isolation and storm atmosphere ✓
- Could use more specific sensory details
- Window view description vague

## Weather Authenticity

**Strengths**:
- Blizzard timing realistic (January in Manitoba/ND)
- Accumulation rates (18 inches overnight) accurate
- Highway closures appropriate response
- Storm warnings progression believable

**Minor Issue**:
- Technical accuracy: specify wind speeds, visibility, specific warnings
- Temperature mentions needed (wind chill in blizzard conditions)

## Contemporary Setting (January 2025)

**Well Done**:
- Phone/weather alerts appropriate
- GPS/navigation references
- Border crossing procedures current
- Hotel booking logistics realistic

**Missing**:
- Social media check-ins (absence needs explanation)
- Photo-taking culture
- Digital weather radar checking

## Sensory Details Needed

**Priority Additions**:
1. **Cold**: Specific temperatures, physical sensation descriptions
2. **Sound**: Wind howl, silence of snow, radio static
3. **Smell**: Coffee, restaurant food, hotel room smell
4. **Touch**: Fabrics, temperature contrasts, snow texture

## Estimated Revisions

- Geographic corrections: 1-2 hours
- Grand Forks enrichment: 2-3 hours
- Sensory enhancement: 2-3 hours

**Total**: 5-8 hours for full world-building polish

## Conclusion

Strong atmospheric foundation. Storm as metaphor works brilliantly. Main issues are geographic accuracy and giving Grand Forks enough personality to match the emotional weight of scenes set there.
