# CONTINUITY-TRACKER REPORT: EPISODE 5 "STORM WARNING"

**Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL CONTINUITY ERROR IDENTIFIED**

## CRITICAL ERRORS (MUST FIX)

### 1. MIT BRIBE TIMELINE CONTRADICTION ⚠️ CRITICAL

**The Problem**:
- **Episode 4 ending**: Robert visits Sophia on January 2nd at 10 AM, gives her MIT offer with 24-hour deadline. Episode ends with Sophia still undecided.
- **Episode 5 opening**: Sophia has already torn up the MIT letter on January 2nd morning before episode even starts.

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Episode 4's cliffhanger is Sophia's impossible choice
- Episode 5 resolves it off-screen before episode begins
- Eliminates dramatic tension of the decision
- Violates episodic storytelling principles

**Required Fix**:
Episode 5 Chapter 1 needs complete restructuring:
- **NEW Scene 1**: Night of January 2-3 - Sophia's decision process (can't sleep, weighing options, moment of tearing letter)
- **NEW Scene 2**: January 3 morning - Telling Ethan about offer AND her decision
- **Scene 3**: Telling parents (current Scene 2)
- Continue with current structure from there

**Impact**: Entire Episode 5 Chapter 1 structure needs revision (add ~1,500-2,000 words)

### 2. Ethan's Knowledge Timeline Inconsistency

**The Problem**:
- Chapter 1 outline suggests Sophia told Ethan on January 2nd evening
- Chapter 3 shows Sophia confessing to Ethan as if it's new information
- His reaction ("Why didn't you tell me?") suggests he's just learning this

**Resolution Needed**:
Either:
A) Chapter 1 shows Sophia NOT telling Ethan about the bribe
B) Chapter 3 confession changes to acknowledge he already knew

**Recommendation**: Option A - Keep Chapter 3's emotional confession intact; revise Chapter 1

## MINOR CONTINUITY ISSUES

### 3. Ashley/Becca Name Inconsistency
- Episodes 1-4: Consistently named "Ashley"
- Episode 5 outline: Called "Becca" once
- **Fix**: Standardize to one name (recommend "Ashley")

### 4. Prep School Departure Date
- Episode 4: Original departure = late January, moved to January 4th
- Episode 5: Original departure = late January, moved to January 7th
- **Fix**: Standardize to January 7th (matches Episode 5's "five days" timeline)

### 5. Sunday/Monday Morning Confusion
- Text says "Sunday morning" but timeline suggests Monday
- **Fix**: Verify date and correct

## CONTINUITY STRENGTHS

✅ **Properly Referenced**:
- Ashley/Ethan breakup from Episode 3
- Sophia/Ethan acknowledged feelings from Episode 4
- Prep school acceleration theme consistent
- Physical locations (Winnipeg, Grand Forks, Highway 75) accurate

✅ **Character Consistency**:
- Sophia's traits and growth align with previous episodes
- Ethan's vulnerability progression feels natural
- Parent relationships track correctly

## PLOT THREAD TRACKING

### THREADS RESOLVED:
1. MIT bribe revealed to Ethan ✓
2. "I love you" exchanged ✓
3. Physical intimacy decision made ✓
4. Relationship now public ✓

### THREADS OPENED:
1. Ethan at Michigan prep school (Episodes 6-8)
2. Secret communication methods
3. Public knowledge at school
4. Parents' legal threats
5. 70-day separation countdown

### THREADS WITH ISSUES:
1. MIT decision resolution - CRITICAL: Resolved off-screen ❌
2. Ethan's knowledge - Inconsistent timing ⚠️

## REQUIRED ACTIONS

**Priority 1 (CRITICAL)**:
1. Restructure Episode 5 Chapter 1 to show MIT decision on-screen
2. Add scene of Sophia telling Ethan about the bribe (or confirm she doesn't tell him)
3. Coordinate with Episode 4 ending if needed

**Priority 2 (IMPORTANT)**:
4. Fix prep school departure date (January 7th recommended)
5. Resolve Ashley/Becca name inconsistency

**Priority 3 (MINOR)**:
6. Verify Sunday/Monday timeline
7. Check Sophia's medal history details

## CONCLUSION

Strong episode with ONE CRITICAL continuity error that must be fixed. The MIT decision happens off-screen between episodes, eliminating Episode 4's cliffhanger and a crucial character moment.

**Estimated Revision Impact**: Chapter 1 MAJOR revision needed (add ~1,500-2,000 words to show decision process)
