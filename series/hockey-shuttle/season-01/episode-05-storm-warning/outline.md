## EPISODE SYNOPSIS

The midseason climax that changes everything. Sophia has rejected Robert's MIT bribe, choosing Ethan and her integrity. But Ethan's prep school departure is suddenly moved up to January 7th—giving them only days instead of weeks. When Sophia's badminton nationals fall on the same weekend in Grand Forks, North Dakota, Ethan defies his parents and insists on driving her.

A massive blizzard hits, stranding them at a motel. In that single night of forced intimacy, everything shifts: Sophia confesses about the MIT bribe, they exchange their first "I love you," they almost sleep together but choose to wait, and they face the devastating realization that his parents' control might never end.

They return to face consequences: his departure moved to immediate, her parents furious, their relationship now public and scorned. The episode ends with Ethan being physically removed by his father while Sophia screams, a borrowed-phone text from Michigan, and the crushing question: can they survive this?

- **Practical**: How will they communicate?
- **Suspenseful**: What are the legal threats?
- **Hopeful**: He's finding ways
- **Season Arc**: Sets up episodes 6-10 (separation period)

### Reader Questions Left Unanswered

## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Voice and Style
- **POV**: Close third person, Sophia's perspective
- **Tone**: Intense, honest, emotionally raw
- **Pacing**: Quick in action, slow in intimate moments
- **Dialogue**: Realistic teenage speech with smart vocabulary
- **Internal**: Deep access to Sophia's thoughts and feelings

### Scene Construction
- **Open scenes**: With immediate action or feeling
- **Build tension**: Through conversation and subtext
- **End scenes**: With questions or mini-cliffhangers
- **Balance**: External action with internal emotion

### The Motel Room Scene (Chapter 3, Scene 5)
- **Most Important Scene in Episode**
- **Guidelines**:
  - Physical intimacy but not sex
  - Emotional intimacy deeper than physical
  - Choosing to wait shows maturity
  - "Not running from something" shows growth
  - Build tension through restraint
  - Both vulnerable, both wanting, both choosing to wait
  - Falling asleep together = ultimate trust

### The Separation Scene (Chapter 4, Scene 5)
- **Second Most Important Scene**
- **Guidelines**:
  - Public humiliation and violence
  - Neighbors watching = no privacy
  - Police = stakes real and serious
  - Physical force = parents' control breaking
  - "Wait for me" = defiant promise
  - Her collapse = physical manifestation of heartbreak
  - Maya catching her = friendship support
