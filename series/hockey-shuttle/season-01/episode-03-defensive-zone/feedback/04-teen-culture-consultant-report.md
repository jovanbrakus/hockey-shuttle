# TEEN-CULTURE-CONSULTANT REPORT: Episode 3

## Overall Grade: 8.5/10
**Authentically written with minor updates needed**

## Critical Fixes:

### 1. Tyler's Instagram Posting (Ch4, lines 777-782)
**Problem:** 2024-2025 teens are hyper-aware of privacy; wouldn't post kissing photos without permission when friend's parents follow them

**Fix:** Add line showing Tyler's regret or make it someone else who posts

### 2. Group Chat References - MISSING
**Biggest gap in 2024 teen communication**
- Teen friend groups live in group chats
- Should appear throughout episode
- "The group chat is blowing up" moments

**Fix:** Add 5-6 group chat references

### 3. Mental Health Language - ABSENT
**2024-2025 teens openly discuss therapy, anxiety, mental health**
- Notably missing despite VERY stressful circumstances
- Could add: Maya suggesting "talk to someone," reference to school counselor

## What Works Perfectly:

✅ **Phone monitoring** (Ch4, line 351): Painfully realistic for 2024-2025
✅ **Text message patterns:** Authentic formatting and style
✅ **Video call studying:** Very current post-2020
✅ **"Your face" jokes:** Exactly how teens banter
✅ **Maya's direct communication:** Perfect protective friend energy

## Technology Accuracy: 9/10

✅ FaceTime for homework
✅ Multiple rapid texts
✅ Lowercase, minimal punctuation
✅ Borrowed phone to avoid monitoring
✅ Instagram as platform

## Slang & Language: A

**Smart choice:** Avoids trendy slang that dates quickly
**Could add:** 1-2 uses of "lowkey/highkey" or "no because" (still current but use sparingly)

## Will This Date?

🟢 **Won't Date:** Physics metaphors, academic pressure, parental control dynamics, Tim Hortons culture
🟡 **Moderate Risk:** Instagram as primary platform (3-5 years)
🔴 **Avoid:** Specific TikTok trends (not present - good!)

## Action Items:

1. Add group chat references (5-6 mentions)
2. Adjust Tyler's posting with remorse/awareness
3. Add 1-2 mental health references
4. Consider adding "lowkey" to Maya's dialogue (optional)
