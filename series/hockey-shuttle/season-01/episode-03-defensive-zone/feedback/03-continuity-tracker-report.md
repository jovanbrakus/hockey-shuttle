## 🚨 CRITICAL ERROR:

### Ethan's Parents' Name Disaster
- **Episode 2 incorrectly calls them "Robert and Caroline HAYES"**
- Should be "Robert and Caroline PRICE"

- **Fix required in Episode 2 immediately**

## Major Errors (5):

1. **David (brother):** Appears only in Ep2, never mentioned in Ep1 or 3
2. **Becca's surname:** Varies Martinez vs Morrison
3. **Tyler called "Tyler Chen":** Should be Tyler Hayes
4. **"Westwood High":** Should be "St. Paul's" 
5. **Jordan's surname:** Uncertain (Nakamura vs Reeves)

✅ **Episode 3 dates work:**
- Mid-October start
