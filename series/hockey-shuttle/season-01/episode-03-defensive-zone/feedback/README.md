## Critical Issues Summary

### MUST FIX (Before Publication):
1. "I love you" scene - make it in-person, not rushed text
2. Six-week relationship period - expand or show key moments
3. Abuse framing - explicitly name parental behavior as abuse
4. Chapter endings - strengthen hooks in Chapters 1 & 2
5. Timeline compression - Chapter 4 needs restructuring

### Phase 1 Priorities:
- All critical emotional beats (I love you, six-week period)
- Abuse recognition and framing
- Chapter 4 restructuring/splitting
- Cliffhanger enhancements
