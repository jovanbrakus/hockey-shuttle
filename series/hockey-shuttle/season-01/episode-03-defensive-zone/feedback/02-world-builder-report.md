# WORLD-BUILDER REPORT: Episode 3 "Defensive Zone"

## Overall Grade: 7.5/10
**Strong foundation, inconsistent execution**

## Critical Issues:

### 1. Provincial Tournament Atmosphere - THIN
**Lines 641-770 (Ch2):**
- No shuttlecock sounds, shoe squeaks, court atmosphere
- Missing crowd reactions, announcements
- No physical exhaustion details
- Venue description absent

**Fix:** Add 50-100 lines of sensory immersion

### 2. Art Studio Climax - UNDERWHELMINGLY DESCRIBED
**Lines 920-998 (Ch3):**
- Crucial scene lacks sensory grounding
- No paint smells, artwork descriptions
- Missing claustrophobic feeling when father arrives
- Party sounds bleeding through not utilized

**Fix:** Add sensory layers to heighten tension

### 3. Winnipeg Wind - MISSING
- Winnipeg is notoriously windy
- Only minimal weather mentions
- Missing characteristic atmospheric element

## What Works Brilliantly:

✅ **Assiniboine Park** (Ch1, lines 758-760): "wood smoke, last cut grass, cold water from the pond" - Perfect multi-sensory
✅ **Tim Hortons details:** Authentic Canadian touchstone
✅ **October-December weather:** Accurate progression
✅ **BDI Ice Cream:** Real local business adds authenticity

## Missing Elements:

- Sound: Ambient noise in most scenes
- Smell: Coffee in Tim Hortons, sweat in tournament
- Texture: Phone warm against cold cheek, car seats in winter
- Temperature contrasts: Indoor/outdoor transitions

## Priority Fixes:

1. **Tournament scene sensory richness** (critical achievement moment)
2. **Art studio atmosphere** (critical emotional moment)
3. **Add Winnipeg wind** throughout (2-3 mentions)
4. **Enhance soundscapes** in all settings

## Best Example to Emulate:

**Ch1, Lines 758-760** - This level of sensory detail should be standard, not exception.
