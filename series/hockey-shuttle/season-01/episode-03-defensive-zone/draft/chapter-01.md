# CHAPTER 1: The Morning After

Sophia's phone buzzed at 6:04 AM, pulling her from a dream she couldn't quite remember. Something about autumn leaves and hands that almost touched but didn't.

The screen lit up with Ethan's name.

**E: Meet before school? Like we promised?**

She stared at the message, her room still dark except for the phone's glow. Sunday night felt like it had happened years ago and also five minutes ago. Standing at The Forks, the city lights below them, his confession hanging in the air between them like something physical she could reach out and touch.

*I haven't stopped thinking about you since you came back.*

Her thumb hovered over the keyboard. Every possible response felt too much or not enough.

**S: Tim Hortons parking lot? 7:15?**

**E: I'll bring coffee**

**S: You don't know my coffee order**

**E: Double double, one sugar packet on the side that you never use but like having the option**

Sophia sat up in bed, something warm spreading through her chest that had nothing to do with the blankets.

**S: How do you—**

**E: See you at 7:15, Soph**

She set the phone down and pressed her palms to her face. Her brain did that thing again—the spiral where everything became an equation except nothing actually solved for x. Numbers jumping around, probabilities that didn't... she couldn't even finish the thought.

But this wasn't physics. This was Ethan Price sitting in his car somewhere right now, probably in his driveway, texting her while his parents slept upstairs. Ethan who'd kissed Becca Martinez goodbye yesterday and then stood with Sophia watching the Esplanade Riel Bridge lights and said things that made her forget how to breathe.

Her phone buzzed again.

**Maya: you're up early**

**Maya: or you never went to sleep**

**Maya: WAIT did something happen after you left the dinner??**

Sophia typed and deleted three responses before settling on: **Meeting Ethan before school. Will explain.**

**Maya: oh you'll DEFINITELY explain**

**Maya: like with DETAILS**

**Maya: bring me a muffin and I might forgive you for holding out**

Sophia smiled despite the knot in her stomach. She rolled out of bed and pulled on jeans and the oversized U of M hoodie Maya had gotten her as a "welcome to Winnipeg winter" gift last month. Her reflection in the mirror looked the same as yesterday, which felt wrong somehow. Shouldn't confession and everything changing show on your face?

Her mom was already up, making breakfast. The smell of congee filled the kitchen.

"You're awake early," Mom said, glancing up from stirring the pot. "Bad sleep?"

"Meeting a friend before school." Sophia grabbed her backpack, checking for her physics textbook. They had a test Wednesday she definitely hadn't studied for.

"This friend have a name?"

"Ethan. We're studying."

Mom's expression did something complicated. "The hockey boy? From when you were little?"

"He's not just—" Sophia stopped herself. "Yeah. Him."

"Your father mentioned his parents are very serious about his training."

"I know."

"Just..." Mom turned back to the congee. "Be careful with serious people's children. They have expectations."

Sophia thought about that as she pulled on her jacket. Expectations. Like Ethan was something to be built according to a plan, not a person who might want different things.

Maybe that's what yesterday was. Everything changing at once.

She grabbed her keys and headed out into the dark morning. October in Winnipeg meant the sun didn't care about your schedule—it showed up when it felt like it. The air bit at her face, frost already forming on car windshields up and down the street.

The drive to Tim Hortons took twelve minutes. She counted every one of them.

Ethan's Jeep was already in the parking lot, engine running, exhaust visible in the cold air. Her heart did something ridiculous that she immediately classified as "elevated cardiovascular response to anticipated social interaction" because giving it a scientific name made it feel less terrifying.

She parked two spots away. Close enough to be obviously there for him, far enough to maintain the illusion of casual.

For a moment, neither of them moved. Just two running cars in a Tim Hortons parking lot at 7:18 AM, winter coming early, everything changed.

Then Ethan's driver door opened.

He stepped out in his Saints hockey warm-up jacket and jeans, hair still wet from a shower, holding two Tim Hortons cups. He looked exactly like he had every morning freshman year when they'd started this ritual—meeting before school to study, to talk, to exist in the space before the rest of the day demanded they be who everyone expected.

Except he didn't look exactly the same. Because now Sophia knew what his voice sounded like saying *I haven't stopped thinking about you* and how his eyes had looked in the bridge lights and the precise way he'd stood just close enough that she could feel the heat from his body without actually touching.

She got out of her car.

"Hi," she said.

"Hi." He held out one of the cups. "Double double. Sugar packet acquired separately and placed in my pocket for safekeeping."

She took the coffee, their fingers brushing. Even through gloves, it felt like something.

"Thanks."

They stood there. A truck pulled into the drive-through lane. Somewhere down Portage Avenue, a snow plow scraped asphalt even though there wasn't really snow yet, just frost and the promise of what was coming.

"This is weird," Ethan said finally.

"So weird."

"Want to sit in my car? It's warmer."

They relocated to the Jeep, Sophia in the passenger seat she'd occupied dozens of times over the past weeks. Ethan turned the heat up. The radio was on low—some morning show hosts laughing about something.

"So," Sophia said.

"So," Ethan echoed.

"Sunday happened."

"Sunday definitely happened." He wrapped both hands around his coffee cup. "I told Becca it was over. Officially. At her house, before I went home."

Sophia's stomach twisted. "How did she—"

"She knew. She saw us at The Forks." Ethan stared at the steering wheel. "She said she'd known for a while, actually. That I wasn't... that my head was somewhere else."

"Ethan—"

"She was kind about it. That's the worst part." He finally looked at Sophia. "She was so understanding it made me feel like even more of an asshole. She said 'go be with whoever makes you look like that.'"

"Like what?"

"I don't know. Present? Alive? She said when I talked about you—about physics and old memories and literally anything you'd said—I lit up. Her exact words: 'You light up like the scoreboard when someone scores.'"

Sophia didn't know what to do with that information. She took a sip of coffee to buy time. Perfect temperature. Perfect sweetness. Perfect sugar packet waiting in his pocket even though she never used it.

"What did your parents say?" she asked.

Ethan's jaw tightened. "That's actually what I need to talk to you about."

Something in his tone made Sophia set down her coffee.

"When I got home last night," Ethan said slowly, "they were waiting up. Both of them. In the living room like it was an ambush."

"Oh no."

"They'd already talked to Becca's mom. Don't ask me how. Winnipeg is a small city when parents are friends." He rubbed his face. "They knew I'd ended it. They knew I was at The Forks. They didn't know with who, but they had theories."

"Let me guess. Their theories involved me."

"My dad said, 'This wouldn't have anything to do with the Chen girl, would it? The one you've been spending every afternoon with?'" Ethan's voice took on an imitation quality. "'The girl who just moved here and suddenly you can't focus on hockey?'"

Sophia's chest felt tight. "What did you say?"

"I told them the truth. That yes, it had to do with you. That I have feelings for you. That Becca and I were ending anyway because I couldn't be with her when I—" He stopped. "When I wanted to be with someone else."

"And?"

Ethan looked at her, and in his eyes, Sophia saw something that made her want to put her hand over his, to touch him, to close the distance that suddenly felt huge even though they were in the same small space.

"They gave me an ultimatum," he said quietly. "Focus on hockey or lose their support for college."

The words hung there like something physical she could choke on.

"What?" Sophia whispered. Then louder: "What?"

"They said—it's not—they've invested everything. The AAA program, the skating coaches, the camps every summer. My dad kept saying 'investment' like I'm a fucking stock portfolio and—" He stopped. Started again. "He had spreadsheets, Sophie. Actual spreadsheets of my performance metrics."

"For a girl."

"They didn't say—well, actually no, my dad literally said 'that Chen girl' which is somehow worse?" Ethan's laugh came out wrong. "He had stats. My assists from the last two games. Penalty minutes. Morrison apparently said I seemed 'distracted' which is bullshit because I played fine, I played—"

His hands were shaking around the cup.

"So I am the distraction."

"No. You're not—Soph, you're not a distraction. You're the opposite. When I'm with you, everything makes sense. Hockey makes sense again, like it did when we were kids and it was just fun. Remember? At Granite Curling Club, before any of this pressure existed?"

Sophia remembered. She remembered being seven and terrible at skating, Ethan laughing but not making fun of her, showing her how to push off, how to stop. Before hockey became his whole identity. Before her parents moved away and she switched to badminton and they both became these achievement-focused people their parents needed them to be.

"I remember," she said.

"But they don't see it that way. They see their investment at risk. They see me potentially not making the NHL or getting a scholarship to a Division 1 program because I'm 'distracted by a relationship.'" He made air quotes with one hand. "They gave me a literal ultimatum. Focus on hockey—and only hockey—or they'll pull funding for college."

"Can they do that?"

"They're paying. So yeah, they can do whatever they want." Ethan's voice was bitter. "I have a trust fund from my grandparents for college, but it's not enough for Ivy League tuition. Not without their help."

Sophia felt something crack in her chest. The unfairness of it, the control, the way they held his future hostage—it made her want to scream. Her hands were shaking, and she pressed them flat against her thighs to steady them.

She couldn't breathe. The Jeep was too small, too hot, everything was—

"I need—" She fumbled for the door handle, couldn't find it, fuck where was—"I need air."

"Sophie—"

But she was already out, stumbling, the November wind hitting her face like a slap. She bent forward, hands on her knees, trying to—lungs, how did lungs—just breathe, just—

This was too much. Too complicated. Too unfair.

After a moment, Ethan was beside her, not touching, just standing close enough that she could feel his warmth.

"I'm sorry," she gasped. "I don't know why—"

"It's okay. It's a lot."

She forced herself to straighten, to breathe normally. And then, only then, did her mind start racing through calculations. Tuition, room and board, fees. His parents' income level based on their house and his training expenses. The trust fund amount he'd need. She was working through optimization algorithms—her brain's default response after the panic passed.

"Stop," Ethan said gently.

"What?"

"I can literally see you calculating. Your left eye does this thing when you're running numbers."

"I don't have a thing."

"You definitely have a thing." He smiled, small and sad. "You're trying to solve this like an equation. But it's not math, Soph. It's people and feelings and my parents' expectations and everything that can't be optimized."

She wanted to argue. Everything could be optimized if you had the right variables. But looking at Ethan's face—the exhaustion under his eyes, the tension in his shoulders, the way he was holding himself together like ice about to crack—she realized he was right.

This wasn't physics. This was them.

"So what do we do?" she asked.

"I don't know. That's why I wanted to meet before school. To figure it out together."

"Together," Sophia repeated. The word felt heavy with implication.

"If you want there to be a together," Ethan added quickly. "I know this is a mess. I know I've made it complicated. If you want to just go back to being friends, I understand—"

"I don't want that."

The words came out before she could stop them.

Ethan went very still. "No?"

"No," Sophia said, more certain now. "I don't want to go back. I tried not feeling this for weeks. I tried optimizing myself out of it. But every time you explained something or made me laugh or texted me some random thing that reminded you of when we were kids, it just got worse. Or better. I don't know which."

"Both," Ethan said softly. "It's definitely both."

They looked at each other. The morning was getting lighter outside, the sky turning from black to gray. Other cars were pulling into the parking lot—the early morning crowd, people stopping for coffee on their way to work.

"We should probably go to school," Sophia said.

"Probably."

Neither of them moved.

"Everyone's going to know," Sophia said. "About you and Becca. They're going to talk."

"They're definitely going to talk."

"I don't want to be the reason you lose everything, Ethan. Your parents are right that you've worked incredibly hard. You love hockey. I've seen you play—you're amazing. I won't be the person who derails that."

"You're not derailing anything. You're—" He reached over and took her hand. Just picked it up off her lap and held it, his glove off, her fingers suddenly wrapped in his. "You make me remember why I loved it in the first place. Before the pressure and the expectations and the scouts and all of it. You were there when it was just fun."

Sophia looked down at their hands. His was bigger, rough on the palm from his stick grip, warm despite the cold.

"Your parents see me as the variable to remove," she said quietly. "To get you back to optimal performance."

"Then we prove them wrong."

"How?"

"We set boundaries. We're careful. You focus on badminton—you have provincials coming up, right? I focus on hockey. We still study together because we're helping each other academically. That's not a relationship, that's academic collaboration."

"Academic collaboration," Sophia repeated.

"With some feelings involved."

"Some extremely complicated feelings."

"The most complicated." Ethan squeezed her hand. "But we can do complicated. You're literally taking AP Physics and Calculus simultaneously. I'm running hockey plays that require calculating angles and velocity in real-time. We understand complicated."

Sophia wanted to point out that calculating puck trajectory was not the same as navigating parental ultimatums and social pressure and whatever this was between them. But the way he was looking at her made her think maybe it didn't matter. Maybe they'd figure it out anyway.

"Okay," she said.

"Okay?"

"We try. We're careful. We give your parents time to see that I'm not a distraction. That we can both be excellent and still—" She gestured between them.

"Still us," Ethan finished.

"Yeah. Still us."

His thumb moved against her knuckles. Just a small movement, barely there. But Sophia felt it like electricity.

"We should really go to school now," she said.

"Definitely."

"People will see us arrive together."

"They've seen us arrive together every morning for weeks."

"True. But now it's different."

"Everything's different," Ethan agreed. Then, quieter: "Is that okay?"

Sophia thought about equations and variables and optimization. She thought about her mom's warning about serious people's children and expectations. She thought about Becca Martinez saying *go be with whoever makes you look like that* and Ethan's face when he talked about physics and her achieving things and remembering when hockey was fun.

"It's terrifying," she said honestly. "But yeah. It's okay."

Ethan smiled—the real one, not the performance version he wore for coaches and parents and anyone who expected him to be perfect. "I'll see you inside?"

"Physics before first period?"

"Obviously."

They separated, the loss of his hand immediate and sharp. Sophia got back into her own car, started the engine, sat there breathing in the coffee-scented air.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Thanks for meeting me**

**E: And for not running**

**S: I've never been good at running**

**S: That's why I chose badminton. You stay in one place and hit things really hard**

**E: Metaphor noted**

**S: See you inside, Ethan**

She put the car in drive and followed his Jeep out of the parking lot, down Portage Avenue toward St. Paul's. Two cars, separate but together. Like particles with charge, close enough to affect each other but not quite touching.

That feeling between them—invisible but definitely there, pulling them together even while they stayed apart.

God, she had it bad.

---

St. Paul's High School looked exactly the same as it had Friday afternoon when Sophia left for the weekend. Same brick facade, same parking lot gradually filling with cars and buses, same groups of students clustering by the front doors to delay going inside for another thirty seconds.

But walking through those doors Monday morning felt like entering a completely different building.

Because everyone knew.

Sophia felt it the moment she stepped into the main hallway. The subtle shift in attention, the glances that lingered half a second too long, the whispers that stopped just as she got close enough to hear actual words.

Maya found her at her locker within ninety seconds.

"Okay, so I heard from Sarah who heard from Emma who heard from Tyler that Ethan and Becca broke up," Maya said without preamble. "And also that they were seen having some kind of intense conversation at The Forks yesterday. And ALSO—" She looked at Sophia. "You have a specific expression right now."

"What expression?"

"The 'something happened and I'm processing it scientifically to avoid processing it emotionally' expression. I know this face. I've seen this face. This is your face when you're trying to turn feelings into equations."

Sophia shoved her textbooks into her locker harder than necessary. "Ethan and I talked. This morning. Before school."

"AND?"

"And it's complicated."

"Everything's complicated. Give me details or I'll make loud speculative announcements in the hallway."

"You wouldn't."

"Try me."

Sophia grabbed Maya's arm and pulled her into the alcove by the water fountains where they had approximately forty-five seconds of privacy before someone else needed water or to eavesdrop.

"He told his parents he has feelings for me," Sophia said quietly. "They gave him an ultimatum. Focus on hockey or lose college funding."

Maya's eyes went wide. "Holy shit."

"Yeah."

"Wait, so his parents are basically saying you're a distraction and he has to choose hockey over you?"

"Not exactly. They're saying he needs to focus on hockey. The 'over me' part is—wait, no, actually his dad did say something about 'certain influences' or was it 'social distractions'? I can't remember the exact—"

"That's the same thing!"

"It's not though, the wording matters because—"

"Sophia. It's the same fucking thing."

"Sophia. Come on." Maya leaned against the wall. "His parents are controlling as hell. Everyone knows it. They've basically engineered his whole life around getting him to the NHL."

"He's really good—"

"He's excellent. That's not the point. The point is they're treating you like a variable to eliminate instead of a person he cares about."

Sophia had literally used the same metaphor in Ethan's car. Hearing Maya say it out loud made it sound even worse.

"We're going to prove them wrong," Sophia said. "Both focus on our sports, maintain academic excellence, show them I'm not a distraction."

"Or," Maya said carefully, "you could tell them to fuck off and let Ethan make his own choices about what makes him happy."

"He's seventeen. They control his college funding."

"Doesn't make it less controlling."

The bell rang—five-minute warning. Students started flowing past them toward classrooms.

"I need to get to physics," Sophia said.

"We're not done talking about this."

"I know."

"And you owe me a muffin. You said you'd bring a muffin."

"I'll get you two muffins."

"Three. Trauma surcharge." Maya hugged her quickly. "Just... don't make yourself smaller for his parents, okay? You're not the problem here."

Sophia nodded, but as Maya walked away, all she could think was: *But what if I am?*

She headed to the physics lab where she and Ethan had started meeting before first period to work through problem sets. It had become routine—arriving early, claiming the back lab table, spreading out textbooks and calculators and working until the warning bell.

He was already there.

Same back table, same AP Physics textbook open, same mechanical pencil he always used. But when he looked up and saw her, his expression did something that made Sophia's cardiovascular response kick into high gear again.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey."

She slid into the seat across from him—their usual configuration. Close enough to share the textbook, far enough to maintain the appearance of appropriate study distance.

Except now every inch between them felt like a measurement she was acutely aware of.

"Everyone's talking," Sophia said, pulling out her own textbook.

"I noticed. Tyler cornered me in the parking lot to ask if I was okay. Jordan texted me six times asking what happened with my parents."

"Maya ambushed me at my locker."

"Are we calling it an ambush when friends express concern?"

"Fair point." Sophia opened to the chapter on centripetal force. "Should we actually study? We have that test Wednesday."

"Are you capable of focusing on physics right now?"

She looked at him. "Probably not. But I'm going to try because that's what I do when things get complicated."

"Retreat into equations."

"It's a valid coping mechanism."

Ethan smiled. "Okay. Centripetal force. Circular motion. Extremely relevant to absolutely nothing in my life right now."

But they tried. They worked through the first problem—something about a car rounding a curve, calculating the friction required to maintain the turn. Sophia showed her work, checking her numbers twice.

"You forgot to convert to meters per second," Ethan said, pointing at her velocity calculation.

"Shit. You're right." She erased, recalculated. "Better?"

"Perfect."

They moved to the next problem. Then the next. Students started filtering into the classroom, taking their seats. The morning announcements crackled over the PA system—something about yearbook photos and the fall play auditions.

Tyler dropped into the seat beside Ethan. "Morning, lovebirds."

"We're studying," Ethan said without looking up.

"Uh-huh. Very studious. Much learning happening."

"Tyler," Sophia said sweetly, "do you understand centripetal force?"

"No?"

"Then stop talking and maybe you'll learn something."

Tyler grinned. "I like her. She's mean."

"I'm not mean. I'm efficient."

"Efficient mean. The best kind."

Mr. Reimer walked in, which saved Sophia from having to respond. The morning lesson began—more circular motion, applications of Newton's laws. Sophia took notes automatically, her brain splitting attention between the board and the acute awareness of Ethan three desks away.

He was doing the same thing, she realized. Taking notes but glancing over. Small looks, barely there. But she felt every single one.

This was going to be impossible.

After class, they walked out together. Tyler and some other hockey guys immediately claimed Ethan, pulling him into conversation about practice that afternoon. Sophia veered toward her locker, putting distance between them like they'd silently agreed.

But she felt him watching as she walked away.

The day continued like that—moments of nearness, deliberate separation, the constant awareness of where he was in relation to where she was. Like her brain had developed a secondary processing system dedicated entirely to tracking Ethan Price's location.

At lunch, they sat at the same table they'd occupied for weeks now. Her, Maya, Ethan, Jordan, Tyler, a rotating cast of other friends. Normal. Except everyone kept looking between them like they were waiting for something to happen.

"So," Jordan said eventually, because Jordan had never met a silence he couldn't fill, "anyone want to talk about the elephant in the room?"

"What elephant?" Ethan asked mildly.

"The Ethan-and-Becca-broke-up-and-maybe-it-has-something-to-do-with-other-people-at-this-table elephant."

"That's a very specific elephant," Sophia said.

"I'm an artist. I paint with words."

"You paint with actual paint, Jordan."

"Multitalented." He looked at Ethan. "Seriously though. You okay?"

Ethan pushed rice around his plate. "Yeah. It was the right thing. Becca and I... we were good, but we weren't right. Not anymore."

"And?" Jordan prompted.

"And nothing. We're focusing on school and sports and not making things complicated."

Maya snorted. "Too late for not complicated."

"Maya," Sophia warned.

"What? I'm just saying. Complicated already happened. You're living in complicated. Complicated is your current zip code."

"That metaphor doesn't work," Tyler said.

"You don't work."

"Children," Jordan sighed. "Can we be supportive without being weird?"

"Where's the fun in that?" But Maya softened. "Seriously though. We're here if you need anything. Both of you."

Sophia caught Ethan's eye across the table. He smiled, small but real.

"Thanks," he said.

The conversation shifted to other things—Tyler's upcoming history presentation, Jordan's art show submission, Maya's girlfriend Sarah joining them for a movie on Friday. Normal teen lunch conversation. Like nothing had changed.

Except everything had.

---

After school, Sophia had badminton practice. Two hours of drills, footwork, hitting shuttles until her arm ached. Coach Yun was ramping up their training—provincials were three weeks away, and the team had a real shot at placing.

"Chen!" Coach called during a water break. "Your cross-court drops are getting sloppy. Tighten your angle."

"Yes, Coach."

She went back to the court, focused on her form, on the precise wrist rotation needed for a perfect drop shot. Badminton was clean. Mechanical. If you did the right things in the right sequence with the right force and angle, the shuttle went where you wanted. Cause and effect. Input and output.

Not like feelings, which were messy and non-linear and refused to be optimized.

"Better!" Coach approved. "Again!"

After practice, Sophia's phone showed three texts from Ethan.

**E: How was practice?**

**E: Ours was brutal. Coach Morrison made us run drills for 45 minutes**

**E: I think he's mad about something but won't say what**

Sophia typed back while walking to her car.

**S: Practice good. Coach says my drops are sloppy**

**S: Obviously I'm now offended and will hit 500 perfect drop shots to prove her wrong**

**E: Obviously**

**E: Want to study later? I could use help with the calc homework**

**S: Can you? Or is your dad monitoring your activities?**

A longer pause before his response came.

**E: Fair point. Maybe better to keep distance for a few days**

**E: Let them see I'm focused**

**S: Yeah. Good idea.**

Sophia sat in her car and stared at that message. *Good idea.* It was a good idea. Strategically sound. Give his parents space to calm down, prove his focus was solid, show that Sophia wasn't impacting his performance.

So why did it feel terrible?

She drove home, did her homework, ate dinner with her parents while half-listening to her dad talk about work and her mom discuss some colleague's drama. Her phone stayed silent.

That night, lying in bed, she pulled up the weather app. First frost warning for Winnipeg. Tomorrow morning would be cold.

A text appeared.

**E: This is harder than I thought it would be**

**S: What is?**

**E: Not talking to you**

**S: We're talking right now**

**E: You know what I mean**

Sophia did know. She knew exactly what he meant. The difference between texting and being in the same space. Between words on a screen and the way his voice sounded when he said her name.

**S: Give it a few days. Let your parents see you're handling things**

**S: Then we can figure out the rest**

**E: The rest meaning us**

**S: If there's an us to figure out**

**E: There's an us, Soph. Even if we're not... official or whatever. There's definitely an us.**

She read that message four times before responding.

**S: Okay. Then we'll figure out us. Just... later.**

**E: Later. I can do later.**

**E: Goodnight**

**S: Night, Ethan**

Sophia set her phone on the nightstand and stared at the ceiling. Her room was dark except for the streetlight outside casting shadows through the blinds. Somewhere across the city, Ethan was in his room too, maybe also staring at his ceiling, thinking about tomorrow and boundaries and how to prove to his parents that caring about someone wasn't the same as losing focus.

Her mom had said be careful with serious people's children.

But what if she was becoming a serious person's child too? What if they both were—products of parental expectations and investment, optimized for achievement, learning to navigate want and duty like they were opposing forces instead of things that could exist simultaneously?

In physics, two forces could act on an object at once. The result was vector addition—magnitude and direction combining to create a new trajectory.

Maybe that's what they were doing. Combining forces. Creating new trajectories.

Or maybe she was overthinking it because that's what she did when she was scared.

Sophia closed her eyes and tried to sleep. Tomorrow would be easier. They'd have their routine, their boundaries, their careful distance.

Tomorrow she wouldn't spend every moment aware of exactly where he was and how many steps it would take to close the space between them.

Tomorrow would definitely be easier.

It was not easier.

---

The week crawled by in a series of moments that were too much and not enough simultaneously.

Tuesday: Physics class where Ethan's hand brushed hers reaching for the same calculator, and they both pulled back like they'd been shocked. Mr. Reimer looking at them quizzically. Tyler grinning from two desks over.

Wednesday: The physics test that Sophia finished in forty minutes and spent the remaining twenty doodling force diagrams in her notebook margins while Ethan worked two rows back. Afterwards he caught her at her locker. "How'd you do?" / "Good. You?" / "Good." Standing there in the crowded hallway with nothing to say and everything to say until Maya appeared and pulled Sophia away to lunch.

Thursday: Study group in the library. Her, Maya, Ethan, Jordan, Tyler, two other friends. Everyone doing homework except Sophia and Ethan were both acutely aware of the fact that their feet were almost touching under the table. Almost. Not quite. Jordan kept looking between them with an expression that said *you two are ridiculous.*

Friday: Ethan's hockey game against Dakota. Sophia didn't go—deliberate choice to give him space. Watched the score online instead. Saints won 4-2. He got two assists. Texted her after: **Played better than last week** / **Good. Proud of you** / **Wish you'd been there** / **Me too**.

By Friday night, Sophia felt like she'd run an emotional marathon while standing still.

Saturday morning, her phone rang. Not texted—actually rang. Ethan's name on the screen.

She answered. "Hello?"

"Hey. Are you busy?"

"Depends. Why?"

"Want to go for a walk? It's actually nice out for once."

Sophia looked out her window. He was right—October sunshine, the kind of clear fall day that Winnipeg got sometimes before winter arrived for real. The trees along her street were still holding onto their leaves, bright red and gold against blue sky.

"Where?" she asked.

"Assiniboine Park? I'll pick you up?"

"Ethan—"

"As friends. Just a walk. We're allowed to be friends."

Friends. Right. Because that's what they were being. Friends who happened to have feelings they were carefully not acting on while his parents monitored his focus and everyone at school watched for drama.

"Okay," Sophia said. "Give me twenty minutes."

She changed into jeans and her warmest sweater, told her mom she was meeting a friend at the park, grabbed her jacket. Ethan's Jeep pulled up exactly twenty minutes later.

"Prompt," she said, climbing in.

"Reliability is important." He was wearing a Saints hoodie and looked tired. "How was your week?"

"Long. Yours?"

"Also long."

They drove to Assiniboine Park, parked near the duck pond, started walking. The park was busy—families with kids, people walking dogs, runners taking advantage of the good weather. The leaves crunched under their feet.

"My parents are watching everything I do," Ethan said after they'd walked in silence for a while. "My dad checks my phone at night. My mom asked my coach about my 'demeanor' at practice. It's like I'm under surveillance."

"That's intense."

"It's suffocating." He shoved his hands in his pockets. "I played well this week. Better than last week. My stats are good. But it's not enough. They want perfect focus, perfect execution, perfect everything."

"You are perfect at hockey," Sophia said.

"Not perfect enough apparently." He kicked at a pile of leaves. "Sorry. I didn't ask you here to complain about my parents."

"Why did you ask me here?"

Ethan stopped walking. They were near the pond, ducks paddling around, the water reflecting the trees and sky.

"Because I missed you," he said simply. "We've seen each other at school but it's not the same. I miss actually talking to you. Not performing being normal in front of other people."

Sophia understood exactly what he meant. This week had been like playing a role—normal friends, nothing complicated, certainly nothing that would be classified as a distraction from hockey.

"I missed you too," she admitted.

They found a bench overlooking the pond and sat down. Not too close, but close enough that she could feel the warmth from his body in the cool air.

"Tell me about badminton," Ethan said. "How's training going?"

"Intense. Coach is preparing us for provincials. I have a real shot at placing in singles."

"Of course you do. You're incredible."

"You've never seen me play."

"I've seen you practice. Through the gym windows. Maybe more than once."

Sophia looked at him. "You watched me practice?"

"You were using the gym during my spare period. I happened to walk by. Multiple times. And stop to watch."

"That's borderline creepy, Ethan."

"Or romantic?"

"Romantically creepy."

He laughed, and it was the first real laugh she'd heard from him all week. The sound made something in her chest loosen.

"Tell me about the game last night," she said. "The actual game, not just the score."

So he did. Described the plays, the assists, the way they'd been down 2-1 in the second period and fought back. How Tyler had screened the goalie perfectly on the third goal, how Jordan—who played defense—had made this incredible breakout pass that led to Ethan's second assist.

Sophia listened and watched him talk. This was the Ethan she remembered from being kids—the one who loved hockey because it was beautiful and fast and required this incredible synchronization between thinking and doing. Not the Ethan who performed under pressure, who calculated every move against scout expectations.

"I love watching you talk about hockey," she said when he finished.

"Yeah?"

"You light up. Like the scoreboard when someone scores."

Ethan went very still. "Becca said that."

"I know. You told me." Sophia pulled her knees up to her chest. "She was right. You do light up."

"Only about certain things."

"Hockey and physics?"

"Hockey and physics and you."

The words hung in the air between them. A dog barked somewhere across the pond. A kid shouted about seeing a duck. Normal park sounds around this moment that felt anything but normal.

"Ethan—"

"I know. We're being careful. Boundaries. Space. Proving focus." He turned to look at her. "But we're also allowed to be honest when we're alone. That was the deal, right? Public distance, private truth?"

"I don't remember negotiating those exact terms."

"I'm negotiating them now."

"That's not how negotiation works."

"Fine. I'm proposing terms. You can accept or counteroffer."

Sophia bit back a smile. "You're ridiculous."

"You like ridiculous."

"I do not."

"You're smiling."

"Am not."

"Sophia Chen, you are definitely smiling."

She was. She couldn't help it. Something about him turned her brain off and something else on—something that didn't calculate or optimize, just felt.

"Okay," she said. "I accept your terms. Public distance, private honesty."

"Mm-hmm."

She nodded, couldn't quite speak.

They sat there, the afternoon sun warm on her face, the air smelling like autumn and leaves and the particular scent of Winnipeg in October—wood smoke from somewhere, the last cut grass, cold water from the pond.

"This is nice," Ethan said softly.

"It really is."

"We should probably go soon though. Before it gets suspicious."

"How long have we been here?"

"Almost two hours."

Sophia checked her phone. He was right. Two hours had vanished while they sat and talked and existed in this bubble where his parents' expectations and school drama and everything else didn't penetrate.

"We should go," she agreed. But neither of them moved.

"Soph?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm really glad you moved back."

She looked at him. His face was open, honest, showing everything he usually kept carefully controlled. This was private-Ethan, not performance-Ethan.

"Me too," she said.

They stood up together. Started walking back toward the parking lot. The sun was lower now, making everything golden. The kind of light that photographers loved, that made ordinary things look magical.

They were almost to his Jeep when Ethan stopped suddenly.

"What?" Sophia asked.

He was looking at her in a way that made her heart rate accelerate. Made her aware of how close they were standing, how the golden light was hitting his face, how his eyes were doing that thing where they looked almost amber instead of brown.

"I really want to kiss you right now," he said quietly.

Every atom in Sophia's body said *yes*.

Every rational thought in her brain said *no*.

"We can't," she whispered.

"I know."

"Your parents—"

"I know."

"We just agreed to boundaries—"

"I know, Soph. I know." But he didn't step back. Neither did she.

They stood there in the parking lot, the space between them measured in inches. Close enough that she could see the gold flecks in his eyes, count the freckles on his nose that only showed up in summer but were still faintly visible. Close enough to feel the rise and fall of his breathing.

"This is a terrible idea," Sophia said.

"The worst."

"We should get in the car."

"Definitely should."

Neither of them moved.

Later, Sophia would think about that moment. How they'd both leaned in, just slightly. How the distance had shrunk to almost nothing. How she'd seen his eyes start to close and felt her own doing the same.

And how they'd both pulled back at the exact same moment.

"We can't," Ethan said, voice rough.

"Not yet," Sophia agreed.

"Not until..."

"Until things are different."

"Yeah."

They got in the car. Ethan started the engine. The radio came on—some indie song about wanting and waiting. He turned it off.

The drive back to her house was quiet. Not awkward, exactly, but charged with everything they'd almost done and chosen not to.

He pulled up in front of her house. She reached for the door handle.

"Sophia?"

She looked back.

"Thank you," he said. "For the walk. For understanding. For not making this easy."

"Not making it easy?"

"If you'd let me kiss you back there, I would have. And then everything would be more complicated. You made the right choice by pulling back."

"We both pulled back," she pointed out. "At the same time."

"Simultaneous decision-making. Very efficient."

"Very us," she agreed.

She got out of the car but leaned back in before closing the door. "Text me later?"

"Always."

Sophia went inside, climbed the stairs to her room, flopped on her bed and stared at the ceiling.

They'd almost kissed.

In a parking lot, in golden autumn light, they'd come within inches of crossing the line they'd agreed not to cross.

And they'd both chosen not to.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: That was the hardest thing I've ever done**

**E: And I've done two-a-day hockey practices in summer**

**S: Same. And I've done badminton conditioning drills in a non-air-conditioned gym**

**E: We're very strong**

**E: Or very stupid**

**E: Possibly both**

**S: Definitely both**

**S: See you Monday?**

**E: Monday. Back to careful distance and public performance**

**S: At least we'll always have Assiniboine Park**

**E: Was that a Casablanca reference?**

**S: Maybe**

**E: I'm a terrible influence. You never made old movie references before me**

**S: You're a GOOD influence. I'm culturally expanding**

**E: That's what I'll tell your parents when they ask why their daughter suddenly quotes 1940s films**

**S: Please never talk to my parents about that**

**E: Noted**

**E: Goodnight, Soph**

**S: Night, Ethan**

Sophia set her phone down and closed her eyes. One week down. His parents were watching. She had provincials in three weeks. He had hockey games and scouts and pressure. They had boundaries and public distance and private honesty.

They had almost-kisses in parking lots and texts that said everything they weren't saying out loud.

It was enough.

It had to be enough.

For now.

Her phone buzzed again. She almost didn't check it, assuming it was Maya with more questions.

But it wasn't Maya.

It was an unknown number. A photo attachment.

She opened it and her blood ran cold.

The photo showed her and Ethan in the Tim Hortons parking lot from that morning. Through the fogged windows of his Jeep, you could clearly see them sitting close, her hand on his face, the moment right before their almost-kiss.

Another text appeared:

**Unknown: Interesting study session. His parents might want to see how their son "focuses" on academics.**

Then nothing. No more messages. No explanation.

Someone had been watching them. Someone had evidence.

And someone wanted her to know they had—
