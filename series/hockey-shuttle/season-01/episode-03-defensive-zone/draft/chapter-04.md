# CHAPTER 4: Power Play

Behind the easel, Sophia held her breath.

From her limited view, she could see Ethan's profile. The way his jaw tightened. The way his hands clenched into fists at his sides. The way he was standing perfectly still, processing the impossible question his father had just asked.

*Are you alone up here?*

The truth would mean everything coming out. Right now. In front of Jordan. With a party full of people downstairs. His father already angry about his roster spot. Everything exploding at the worst possible moment.

The lie would protect her. Would buy them time. Would let them figure this out on their own terms instead of having it forced into the open by circumstance.

Sophia watched Ethan's shoulders rise and fall with one deep breath.

"Jordan was up here," Ethan said. "He left when you showed up."

It wasn't exactly a lie. Jordan had been up here. But it also wasn't the truth.

Robert Price's eyes narrowed, scanning the room again. Landing on those two cups.

"Jordan drinks cider?" he asked.

"We both do," Ethan said evenly. "It's a party. People drink things."

Sophia pressed herself flatter against the wall behind the easel, making herself as small as possible. Her Einstein costume suddenly felt ridiculous—the lab coat too white, too visible. If he came farther into the room...

But Robert didn't move from the doorway. "Get your coat. We're leaving."

"What's this about my roster spot?"

"Not here. At home."

"Dad—"

"Ethan. Car. Now."

The command in his voice made even Sophia flinch. This wasn't a parent making a request. This was someone who expected immediate obedience.

Ethan looked back into the room one more time. His eyes didn't go to where Sophia was hiding—that would have given her away—but she saw the apology in his expression anyway.

Then he followed his father out.

Sophia waited thirty seconds. Then a minute. Then Jordan appeared in the doorway.

"He's gone," Jordan said quietly. "They're driving away."

Sophia emerged from behind the easel, her legs shaking.

"You okay?" Jordan asked.

"No. Maybe. I don't know." She sank onto the paint-stained couch. "What just happened?"

"Ethan's dad showed up looking for him. Said something about his roster spot being reconsidered. He was pissed."

"But why? Ethan's been playing well. He had three points in the scout game."

"I don't know. But whatever's going on, it's bad."

Sophia pulled out her phone. No texts from Ethan. No calls. Just silence.

"I should go home," she said.

"You're shaking."

"I'm fine."

"Sophia—"

"I just need to go home, Jordan."

He drove her, because Maya was still at the party and Sophia couldn't face going back downstairs. Couldn't face people asking where she'd been, why she looked upset, what had happened to her matching costume twin.

In Jordan's car, she finally asked: "Did you know Ethan's dad was that controlling?"

Jordan was quiet for a moment. "It's not just controlling, Sophia. What Ethan's parents do... Maya told me her mom's a therapist, and she says it has a name. Emotional abuse. The way they control every aspect of his life, use his hockey career as leverage, threaten to take things away if he doesn't comply... That's not normal parenting. That's abuse."

Sophia felt something cold settle in her stomach. "But everyone just accepts it?"

"Everyone knows. The whole team knows. It's just... that's Ethan's life, you know? He's dealt with it forever. The school counselor has tried to talk to him about it, but he won't admit anything's wrong. Says they're just 'intense about his success.'"

"It's not right."

"No. But it's his reality. And now..." Jordan glanced at her. "Now he's got something they can use against him. You."

The words hit like ice water.

Jordan pulled up to her house. The lights were on inside—her parents still awake, waiting.

"Thanks for the ride," Sophia said.

"Anytime. And Sophie? For what it's worth, I think you're good for him. I've known Ethan since we were kids, and I've never seen him as happy as he's been since you moved back. But his parents... they're going to make this ugly. You need to be prepared for that."

"His happiness is going to cost him everything."

"Maybe. Or maybe it'll show him there's more to life than what his parents planned. Maybe you're exactly what he needs to finally stand up to them."

Sophia went inside, told her parents the party was boring so she came home early, went to her room and stared at her phone.

Nothing.

She changed out of her Marie Curie costume, washed off the red lipstick, lay in bed still wearing the Einstein wig because taking it off felt like admitting something was over.

At 11:47, her phone finally buzzed.

**E: I'm sorry**

**S: Are you okay?**

**E: No**

**E: Can you talk?**

**S: Calling now**

She hit his contact before he could respond. He answered on the first ring.

"Hey," he said, voice rough.

"What happened?"

"My roster spot. They're threatening to move me down to AA if I don't 'refocus on hockey.' Apparently someone told Coach Morrison I was 'distracted' at the party. That I was upstairs with a girl instead of networking with the scouts who were there."

"There were scouts at Tyler's party?"

"A couple guys who work with the junior teams. They saw me go upstairs and not come back down. Someone made sure they knew I wasn't alone up there."

"Who would—"

"Tyler. Had to be Tyler. He's been pissed since Becca and I broke up. Since he figured out it was because of you."

"Ethan—"

"My dad's furious. He says if I get moved down to AA, my junior prospects are gone. No scholarships, no NHL development program, nothing. Everything they've invested, everything they've planned—gone."

Sophia's chest felt tight. "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know. They want me to... They basically said I need to stop seeing you."

The words hung between them through the phone connection.

"Did they say that explicitly?"

"They said I need to 'eliminate distractions' and 'commit fully to hockey.' But we both know what they mean."

"So we stop seeing each other."

"What? No. Sophie—"

"Your whole future, Ethan. Your hockey career. Everything your parents have worked for—"

"Everything THEY'VE worked for. Not me. I never asked for this level of pressure. I just wanted to play hockey because I loved it. But they turned it into this thing, this machine that controls my entire life. And now they want to use it to control who I can care about?"

"It's still your future."

"Is it? Or is it theirs?"

Sophia didn't have an answer for that.

"I need to see you," Ethan said. "Tomorrow. Can you meet me?"

"Your parents—"

"Are going to their stupid country club thing from noon to four. Please, Sophie. I need to figure this out with you, not over the phone."

"Okay. Where?"

"The art studio. Jordan gave me the key weeks ago. Two o'clock?"

"I'll be there."

"Sophie? We're going to figure this out. I promise."

She wanted to believe him. But as she lay in the dark after hanging up, all she could think about was the equation they were trying to solve. His future plus her presence equaled failure in his parents' eyes. The math was simple.

The solution was, too.

She just didn't want to accept it.

---

November third. Two PM. The art studio was empty, autumn light filtering through dirty windows, paint smell and dust motes and the ghost of last night's almost-confession still hanging in the air.

Ethan was already there when Sophia arrived, sitting on the paint-stained couch, head in his hands. He looked up when she entered, and she could see he hadn't slept.

"Hey," she said softly.

"Hey."

She sat next to him, not touching. The distance between them felt calculated, measured. Like they were both afraid that contact would make everything harder.

"Talk to me," she said.

"My parents called a meeting with Coach Morrison this morning. They're threatening to pull their donation to the hockey program if he doesn't keep me on AAA. He's pissed. Says he doesn't respond to threats, but also made it clear that if I don't start showing 'appropriate focus,' he'll have no choice but to make roster changes."

"That's manipulation."

"That's my life, Sophie. Everything is leverage. Everything is a negotiation. Even this—us—it's just another variable they're trying to control."

"Maybe they're right."

Ethan's head snapped up. "What?"

"Maybe I am a distraction. Maybe you'd be better off—"

"Stop." He turned to face her fully. "Don't do that. Don't let them get in your head."

"I'm being realistic. Your hockey career—"

"Is not more important than my life. Than having actual connections with people. Than being happy."

"Your parents think it is."

"My parents think a lot of things. Doesn't make them right." He ran a hand through his hair. "Jordan said something last night, after you left. He said what my parents do has a name."

Sophia waited.

"Abuse," Ethan said quietly. "He called it emotional abuse. Said Maya's mom is a therapist and she has a whole framework for identifying it. The control, the manipulation, using my dreams as weapons against me... He said it's not normal."

"It's not," Sophia agreed. "You know it's not, right? The way they treat you?"

"I know. Logically, I know. But it's been my whole life. I don't know how to push back without losing everything."

"Is hockey worth keeping if it comes with those conditions?"

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "I used to think so. Hockey was everything. The only thing that mattered. But then you came back, and suddenly there were other things. Other possibilities. You make me remember that there's more to life than just being excellent at one thing."

"Your parents won't accept that."

"No. They won't." He took a shaky breath. "They're sending me to prep school."

The words hit Sophia like a physical blow. "What?"

"Shattuck-St. Mary's in Minnesota. It's one of the top hockey prep schools in North America. They've been threatening it for years, but now... They gave me an ultimatum. Either I go for second semester, focus completely on hockey, and 'get my priorities straight,' or they pull all support. No hockey fees, no equipment, no university fund. Nothing."

"They can't just—"

"They can. And they will. You don't know them like I do. When they make a threat, they follow through."

Sophia felt tears building behind her eyes. "When?"

"After Christmas. January second."

"That's eight weeks away."

"I know."

"So what do we do?"

Ethan looked at her, and she could see him wrestling with something. "We could stop. End this now before it gets harder. You could focus on badminton and nationals, I could focus on hockey, we could just... be friends."

"Is that what you want?"

"No." The word came out fierce. "I want to date you publicly. Hold your hand in the hallways. Take you to winter formal. Tell everyone that you're my girlfriend and I'm your boyfriend and that's just how it is. I want normal teenage relationship things. But I can't have those."

"So what's the alternative?"

"We be careful. Really careful. Secret careful. And we take these eight weeks and we make them count. Then when I'm at prep school, we figure out long distance. And when I come back for senior year, we'll be together. Publicly. Because by then I'll be eighteen and they can't control everything."

"That's a lot of sneaking around."

"I know."

"A lot of lying."

"I know."

"Your parents will make your life hell if they find out."

"They already make my life hell. At least this way, I get something good out of it."

Sophia looked at him—really looked. He was asking her to be his secret. To accept hidden moments and careful lies and the constant threat of discovery. It went against everything she believed about honesty and directness.

But he was also sitting here, exhausted and defeated, fighting against parents who controlled his entire life, trying to carve out just one thing that was his.

"Okay," she said.

"Okay?"

"We'll be careful. We'll be secret. We'll take these eight weeks."

"You sure?"

"No. But I'm sure about you. That's enough for now."

Ethan exhaled like he'd been holding his breath since last night. Then he kissed her. Soft and grateful and a little desperate.

"Thank you," he whispered against her lips.

"Don't thank me yet. We haven't even started the hard part."

---

The hard part, as it turned out, was everything.

Being secret meant no holding hands, no obvious looks, no sitting together at lunch. It meant Maya being confused why Sophia was suddenly distant. It meant watching Becca flirt with Ethan in the hallways and not being able to say anything. It meant stolen moments—five minutes between classes, texts sent from different rooms, meetings in the art studio when Jordan could cover for them.

The first two weeks were torture.

"I hate this," Sophia said one Tuesday afternoon. They were in the art studio, supposed to have twenty minutes before Ethan had practice, but time always went too fast.

"I know." He was playing with her hair, her head in his lap as they sat on the couch. "But it's temporary."

"Six more weeks isn't temporary."

"In the grand scheme of things—"

"Don't go philosophical on me. That's my thing."

He smiled. "You're right. This sucks."

"Tyler posted another Instagram story about you and Becca. 'Power couple reunited?'"

"Tyler's an ass. And Becca and I aren't anything."

"She doesn't seem to know that."

"She does. I was very clear. We're friends, nothing more."

"She sat in your lap at lunch yesterday."

"And I moved her off."

"After like thirty seconds."

"It took me a second to process what was happening."

"Thirty seconds."

Ethan laughed. "Are you jealous?"

"I'm frustrated. I have to watch other people act like you're available when you're not."

"I'm really not."

"Prove it."

He kissed her, and for a few minutes, the frustration faded. But it always came back.

Week three brought the Remembrance Day tournament. Ethan played three games in two days, scouts watching every shift. Sophia sat in the stands with Maya and Sarah, cheering like a casual friend, dying inside every time his parents yelled criticism from their seats.

"They're so intense," Maya muttered after Ethan's mom screamed at him for a missed pass.

"Yeah," Sophia agreed, keeping her voice neutral.

"I don't know how he deals with it."

*He deals with it by texting me at midnight, voice breaking over FaceTime, wondering if he'll ever be good enough,* Sophia thought.

But she just said, "He's tough."

Week four was American Thanksgiving. Ethan's parents took him to Minneapolis to tour Shattuck-St. Mary's. He sent Sophia pictures—pristine facilities, Olympic-sized rink, dorm rooms that looked like jail cells.

**E: They love it here**

**S: Do you?**

**E: I want to come home**

**S: Four more weeks**

**E: Feels like forever**

**E: I miss you**

**S: I miss you too**

**E: No, like I MISS you miss you**

**E: Can't stop thinking about the art studio**

**E: Your laugh**

**E: The way you explain physics like poetry**

**S: You're going to make me cry in calc class**

**E: Sorry**

**E: Not sorry**

**E: Completely not sorry**

Week five brought snow and secrets almost exposed. Tyler saw them together at the coffee shop—not touching, not obviously together, but laughing at something on Sophia's phone. His eyes narrowed, and the next day there were questions.

"So you and Sophia are friends now?" Tyler said at practice, loud enough for others to hear.

"We've been friends since she moved back," Ethan replied evenly.

"Funny kind of friends."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Nothing. Just interesting timing. You break up with Becca, start hanging out with Chen..."

"Careful, Tyler."

"I'm just saying what everyone's thinking."

"Everyone needs to mind their own business."

Tyler posted another story that night. A picture from the party, Ethan in his Einstein costume. Caption: "Some people forget where they came from."

Sophia wanted to comment, to defend him, to fight back. But that would give them away. So she stayed quiet and sent Ethan funny physics memes instead, trying to make him smile through the frustration.

Week six was the worst.

December arrived with a blizzard that shut down school for two days. Ethan's parents used the time to increase his training—double sessions, video review, calls with prep school coaches. He looked exhausted when school resumed.

"I can't do this much longer," he admitted one afternoon. They had ten minutes in the art studio before Jordan's art class actually needed the space.

"Two more weeks."

"Then four months of prep school."

"We'll handle it."

"Will we? Sophie, I'm already breaking and I haven't even left yet."

She touched his face. "You're not breaking. You're bending. There's a difference."

"Physics metaphor?"

"Life metaphor."

He leaned into her hand. "I don't know how to leave you."

"Then don't think about leaving. Think about coming back."

"May feels like a lifetime away."

"Time is relative."

"That's not how relative time works."

"Don't correct my physics when I'm trying to be romantic."

He laughed, but it was hollow. "I love that about you."

Sophia froze. "What?"

Ethan seemed to realize what he'd almost said. "I... I mean..."

"Ethan."

"I should go. Practice."

"Ethan, wait—"

But he was already leaving, and the moment was gone.

They didn't talk about it. Not during the rushed texts that night, not during the five minutes they had the next morning. The almost-confession hung between them like another secret to keep.

Week seven brought the Christmas tournament and Ethan's extended family visiting. No contact for four days except for one text at 2 AM:

**E: I can't stop thinking about what I almost said**

**S: Almost said?**

**E: You know what**

**S: Maybe I need to hear it**

**E: Not like this**

**E: Not in a text**

**E: You deserve better**

**S: When then?**

**E: Soon**

**E: I promise**

December twenty-first. The last day of school before winter break. Ethan had eleven days left in Winnipeg.

Sophia found him at his locker after last period, most students already gone for the holidays.

"Hey," she said.

"Hey."

"You've been avoiding me."

"I've been with family all week."

"That's not what I mean."

He closed his locker, looked around the empty hallway. "Can we talk? Properly?"

"When?"

"Tonight. My parents have a thing. Can you come over?"

"To your house?"

"I know it's risky—"

"I'll be there."

That night, Sophia told her parents she was studying with Maya and drove to Ethan's house. His Jeep was in the driveway, porch light on. Her hands shook as she rang the doorbell.

He answered immediately. "Hi."

"Hi."

"Come in."

His house was exactly what she expected—pristine, cold, photos of hockey achievements on every wall. No family pictures, just Ethan in various jerseys, holding trophies, success documented and displayed.

They went to his room. More hockey. Posters of NHL players, shelves of trophies, a desk covered in recruitment letters. The only personal touches were a few paperback books and a photo from freshman year—their study group at Tim Hortons.

"Your parents—"

"Won't be back until eleven. We have time."

They sat on his bed, careful space between them.

"I need to tell you something," Ethan said. "Before I leave. Before everything gets harder."

Sophia waited.

"I love you."

The words landed like physical things in the room.

"I know we've only been together six weeks," he continued, "and I know it's fast, and I know the timing is terrible, but I love you. I've been falling for you since that first morning at Tim Hortons when you called my explanation of hockey strategy 'needlessly complex.' You make me laugh. You make me think. You make me want things beyond hockey and expectations and my parents' plan. You make me feel like I could be more than just excellent at one thing."

Sophia's eyes were burning. "Ethan—"

"You don't have to say it back. I just needed you to know. Before I leave. In case... in case everything falls apart, I needed you to know that this—us—it matters to me. More than hockey. More than scholarships. More than any of it."

"I love you too."

The words came out rushed, desperate. "I love your terrible physics explanations and your secret art obsession and the way you see hockey as poetry. I love that you remember my coffee order and that you think my competitiveness is attractive instead of intimidating. I love that you're fighting so hard against everything trying to control you. I love you, and I hate that I have to love you in secret, and I hate that you're leaving, and I hate that loving you is making your life harder—"

He kissed her. Deep and desperate and full of everything they couldn't say in stolen moments. When they broke apart, they were both crying.

"This is so messed up," Sophia whispered.

"I know."

"What are we doing?"

"Surviving. Together."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

They held each other on his bed, in his hockey shrine of a room, time ticking toward his parents' return. Neither wanting to let go. Neither ready for what came next.

"I leave in eleven days," Ethan said into her hair.

"I know."

"I'll come back."

"I know."

"I'll love you the whole time."

"I know that too."

At 10:30, she had to go. They stood at his front door, not touching because the neighbors might see.

"Eleven days," he said.

"We'll make them count."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

She drove home with tears streaming down her face, his I love you echoing in her chest, the countdown beginning.

Eleven days.

Then four months.

Then maybe, if they were lucky, they could stop hiding.

But first, they had to survive the leaving.

---

December 27th. The day before Ethan left for prep school.

They met one last time in the art studio. Jordan had given them two hours, standing guard, making sure no one would interrupt.

Ethan brought hot chocolate. Sophia brought the notebook he'd given her weeks ago, now half-filled with physics metaphors for feelings she couldn't properly name.

They sat on the paint-stained couch, her legs across his lap, trying to memorize everything.

"Read me something," he said. "From the notebook."

She flipped through pages. "This one's from November: 'Entropy increases in closed systems, but we're not closed. We're open to the universe, creating order from chaos, making patterns from possibility.'"

"I like that one."

"This one's from last week: 'Force equals mass times acceleration, but what's the formula for the force of missing someone? What's the acceleration of absence?'"

"Getting sad now."

"One more. From yesterday: 'Energy can't be created or destroyed. Just transformed. So this isn't ending. It's just changing state.'"

"Like ice to water."

"Like everything to everything else."

They were quiet for a moment.

"I don't want to go," Ethan said.

"I don't want you to go either."

"But I have to."

"I know."

"This isn't goodbye."

"You said that already."

"I need to keep saying it."

Sophia set the notebook aside. "Can we just... not talk about leaving? For a little while?"

"What should we talk about?"

"Anything else. Tell me about something that has nothing to do with hockey or parents or leaving."

"Did you know that the Winnipeg Art Gallery has the world's largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art?"

"Random."

"I've been researching. For when I come back. Places to take you on actual dates. Public dates. Where I can hold your hand and everyone can see."

"Tell me more."

So he did. He talked about museums and restaurants and concerts they'd go to. She talked about summer physics programs and road trips to the lake and teaching him to play badminton. They painted a future that felt possible if they could just get through the next four months.

At 5 PM, Jordan texted that Ethan's parents were looking for him.

"I have to go," Ethan said.

"I know."

They stood. Held each other. Neither moving toward the door.

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too."

"I'll text when I can. FaceTime when it's safe."

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

He kissed her one more time. Then again. Then again.

"Ethan. You have to go."

"I know."

But he kissed her again anyway.

Finally, Jordan's knock forced them apart.

"They're calling you," Jordan said through the door. "You need to leave."

Ethan grabbed his coat. Looked at Sophia one more time.

"May," he said. "I'll be back in May."

"I'll be counting the days."

"That's 127 days."

"You counted?"

"Of course I counted."

Then he was gone, and Sophia was alone in the art studio with two cups of cold hot chocolate and a notebook full of metaphors for a feeling that didn't need metaphors anymore.

Love.

Simple. Complicated. Transforming.

---

December 28th, 6:47 AM.

Sophia woke to her phone buzzing.

**E: We're leaving**

**E: I meant it**

**E: All of it**

**E: I love you**

She typed back immediately:

**S: I love you too**

**S: I meant it too**

**S: Every word**

**E: 127 days**

**S: 127 days**

**E: Starting now**

**S: Starting now**

**S: Drive safe**

**E: I'll text when we get there**

**E: Six hours to Minnesota**

**E: Longest six hours of my life**

**S: Still shorter than 127 days**

**E: True**

**E: I have to go**

**E: They're calling**

**S: Go**

**S: I'm here when you get there**

**E: Promise?**

**S: Promise**

**E: I love you**

**S: I love you too**

**S: Now GO before your parents get suspicious**

The message showed as delivered, then read. Then nothing. He was in the car, driving away, but the words had been said. Properly. In person and in text. Real.

Sophia lay in bed and stared at her ceiling and held onto what Ethan had written: *Energy can't be created or destroyed. Just transformed.*

They weren't ending.

They were transforming.

She had to believe that.

She had to.

Her phone buzzed again.

But it wasn't Ethan.

It was Jordan.

**Jordan: Ethan's gone?**

**S: Just left**

**Jordan: You okay?**

**S: Ask me in 127 days**

**Jordan: Fair**

**Jordan: Listen, I need to tell you something**

**Jordan: About his parents**

**Jordan: What they're doing to him**

**S: Jordan?**

**Jordan: It's abuse, Sophia. What they do to him. It has a name.**

**Jordan: And if it gets worse at prep school**

**Jordan: If he needs help**

**Jordan: Promise me you'll help him see that**

**Jordan: Promise me you'll help him get out if he needs to**

**S: I promise**

**Jordan: Good**

**Jordan: He's lucky to have you**

**Jordan: Even if his parents can't see it**

Sophia wanted to believe that too.

But as December 28th turned into December 29th, as the days passed with only careful texts because his parents were monitoring his phone, as the first week at prep school came and went with one brief, tearful FaceTime call where he looked exhausted and defeated...

Sophia started to wonder if love was enough when you were fighting against people who had all the power.

---

**January 2nd, 11:23 PM**

Sophia's phone lit up with a FaceTime call from an unknown number.

She almost didn't answer.

But something made her click accept.

Ethan's face appeared on screen. He was in a dorm room, sitting on a basic bed, wearing a Shattuck-St. Mary's hockey hoodie.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey. Unknown number?"

"Borrowed my roommate's phone. Mine's being monitored."

"Isn't that against the rules?"

"Probably. But I had to see you. Had to tell you I love you and see your face when I said it."

Sophia's heart did complicated things. "I love you too. How is it?"

"It's... intense. The training is insane. The academics are rigorous. Everyone here is good at hockey, which is different from being the best guy on a regular team."

"Are you okay?"

"I miss you. Is that an answer?"

"It's an answer."

They looked at each other through their screens. He was 407 miles away. Six hours by car. A different state. A different life.

"This is temporary, Sophie. One semester. I'll be back in May for senior year."

"121 days to go."

"You're counting."

"Of course I'm counting."

"That's very you."

"Shut up."

"Never. I love that you're counting. I love you."

"I love you too."

"Say it again."

"I love you, Ethan Price."

"Once more."

"Greedy."

"Storing them up. For the bad days."

"I love you. I love you. I love you."

His smile was soft. Grateful. "I'll find a way to call next week."

"I'll be here."

"121 days, Sophie."

"121 days."

"We can do this."

Looking at him—exhausted but determined, 407 miles away but still hers—Sophia believed it.

They could do this.

They had to.

Because the alternative was unthinkable.

"I should go," Ethan said. "Before my roommate comes back."

"Okay."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

"121 days."

"120 days and 27 minutes, technically."

He laughed. "I love your brain."

"Just my brain?"

"Everything. I love everything about you."

"Good answer."

"Sophie?"

"Yeah?"

"When I come back, I'm done hiding. I don't care what they threaten. I want everyone to know you're mine and I'm yours."

"That's a big promise."

"It's a promise I'm going to keep."

The door opened behind him—his roommate returning.

"I have to go."

"I know."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

The call ended.

Sophia looked at her phone. Started a new note. Typed:

*Day 6 of 127. He loves me. I love him. We're going to make it.*

Then she opened her physics textbook, because if she was going to survive the next 121 days, she needed something constant. Something predictable.

Something that wasn't love during impossible circumstances.

But even as she solved practice problems, she kept thinking about phase transitions. Solid to liquid to gas. The same substance, just in different states.

Maybe that's all this was.

A phase transition.

Same love.

Different state.

Temporary.

She had to believe that.

Outside, Winnipeg winter pressed against her window. Minus thirty with the windchill. Everything frozen. Waiting for spring.

Waiting for May.

Waiting for Ethan.

121 days.

But who was counting?

(She was. Every single day. Every single hour. Because that's what you do when you love someone who's been sent away. You count. You wait. You transform.)
