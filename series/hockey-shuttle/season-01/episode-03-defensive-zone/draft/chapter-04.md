# CHAPTER 4: Power Play

Behind the easel, Sophia held her breath.

From her limited view, she could see Ethan's profile. The way his jaw tightened. The way his hands clenched into fists at his sides. The way he was standing perfectly still, processing the impossible question his father had just asked.

*Are you alone up here?*

The truth would mean everything coming out. Right now. In front of Jordan. With a party full of people downstairs. His father already angry about his roster spot. Everything exploding at the worst possible moment.

The lie would protect her. Would buy them time. Would let them figure this out on their own terms instead of having it forced into the open by circumstance.

Sophia watched Ethan's shoulders rise and fall with one deep breath.

"Jordan was up here," Ethan said. "He left when you showed up."

It wasn't exactly a lie. Jordan had been up here. But it also wasn't the truth.

Robert Price's eyes narrowed, scanning the room again. Landing on those two cups.

"Jordan drinks cider?" he asked.

"We both do," Ethan said evenly. "It's a party. People drink things."

Sophia pressed herself flatter against the wall behind the easel, making herself as small as possible. Her Einstein costume suddenly felt ridiculous—the lab coat too white, too visible. If he came farther into the room...

But Robert didn't move from the doorway. "Get your coat. We're leaving."

"What's this about my roster spot?"

"Not here. At home."

"Dad—"

"Ethan. Car. Now."

The command in his voice made even Sophia flinch. This wasn't a parent making a request. This was someone who expected immediate obedience.

Ethan looked back into the room one more time. His eyes didn't go to where Sophia was hiding—that would have given her away—but she saw the apology in his expression anyway.

Then he followed his father out.

Sophia waited thirty seconds. Then a minute. Then Jordan appeared in the doorway.

"He's gone," Jordan said quietly. "They're driving away."

Sophia emerged from behind the easel, her legs shaking.

"You okay?" Jordan asked.

"No. Maybe. I don't know." She sank onto the paint-stained couch. "What just happened?"

"Ethan's dad showed up looking for him. Said something about his roster spot being reconsidered. He was pissed."

"But why? Ethan's been playing well. He had three points in the scout game."

"I don't know. But whatever's going on, it's bad."

Sophia pulled out her phone. No texts from Ethan. No calls. Just silence.

"I should go home," she said.

"You're shaking."

"I'm fine."

"Sophia—"

"I just need to go home, Jordan."

He drove her, because Maya was still at the party and Sophia couldn't face going back downstairs. Couldn't face people asking where she'd been, why she looked upset, what had happened to her matching costume twin.

In Jordan's car, she finally asked: "Did you know Ethan's dad was that controlling?"

"Everyone knows. The whole team knows. It's just... that's Ethan's life, you know? He's dealt with it forever."

"It's not right." Sophia's voice shook with anger. "What they're doing—monitoring his phone, controlling his relationships, threatening his college funding—that's not just controlling. That's abuse."

Jordan was quiet for a moment. "You're right. It is abuse. But no one calls it that because they're rich and they're 'invested in his success' and he's going to get a college scholarship out of it."

"That doesn't make it okay."

"No, it doesn't. I've tried talking to him about it. Even suggested he talk to the school counselor. But he's been conditioned to think this is normal. That this is just what elite athlete parents do."

"It's not normal. And someone needs to tell him that."

"I know. We all know. But he has to be ready to hear it."

Jordan pulled up to her house. The lights were on inside—her parents still awake, waiting.

"Thanks for the ride," Sophia said.

"Anytime. And Sophie? For what it's worth, I think you're good for him. I've known Ethan since we were kids, and I've never seen him as happy as he's been since you moved back."

"His happiness is going to cost him everything."

"Maybe. Or maybe it'll show him there's more to life than what his parents planned."

Sophia went inside, told her parents the party was boring so she came home early, went to her room and stared at her phone.

Nothing.

She changed out of her Marie Curie costume, washed off the red lipstick, lay in bed still in her Einstein wig because taking it off felt like admitting something was over.

At 11:47, her phone finally buzzed.

**E: I'm sorry**

**S: For what?**

**E: All of it. My dad showing up. You having to hide. Everything.**

**S: What happened with your roster spot?**

**E: Can I call you?**

**S: Yes**

Two seconds later, her phone rang. She answered immediately.

"Hey," Ethan said. His voice sounded exhausted.

"Hey. What happened?"

"Coach Morrison called my parents. Said there are concerns about my 'focus and commitment.'"

"That's ridiculous. You've been playing great."

"Apparently it's not about how I play. It's about my attitude in practice. They think I'm distracted. Coach mentioned I've been on my phone more, leaving practices early, missing optional training sessions."

"Have you?"

"I left one practice early to watch your tournament. I've been texting during breaks. But nothing that should affect my roster spot." He paused. "Unless someone said something."

"Said what?"

"About you. About us. About me being distracted by a relationship."

Sophia sat up in bed. "Do they know?"

"They didn't say your name specifically. But my dad kept asking if there was 'someone' affecting my performance. If I was prioritizing 'social relationships' over hockey."

"What did you tell him?"

"The truth. That I've been playing well, my stats are good, I got interest from a Division 1 scout. But he's not interested in results. He's interested in process. And apparently my process has been compromised."

"By me."

"Sophie, no—"

"It's true though. I am a distraction. Tyler said the team needs you focused. Your dad thinks you're prioritizing social relationships. Everyone can see you're different."

"Different isn't bad. Different is just different."

"Different is threatening your roster spot."

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "They want to send me to prep school."

Sophia felt like she'd been hit. "What?"

"There's a hockey prep school in Massachusetts. Shattuck-St. Mary's. It's where elite players go for extra development. My dad thinks a year there would 'refocus' me. Get me away from distractions."

"Away from me."

"Away from everything here. It's like a reset button for my career."

"Would you have to go?"

"They're calling it an opportunity. But it feels like an ultimatum. Either I prove I can maintain focus here, or they send me away."

Sophia lay back down, staring at her ceiling. "So what do we do?"

"I don't know. My dad is watching everything now. My phone, my schedule, my time. He's talking about getting daily reports from Coach Morrison."

"That's insane."

"That's my life." His voice was bitter. "This is what happens when your parents invest everything in your success. You become an investment to manage."

"Ethan—"

"I'm sorry. I shouldn't dump this on you. You just won silver at provincials. You're going to nationals. You should be celebrating, not dealing with my family drama."

"Your family drama is affecting both of us now."

"I know. And I hate that." He paused. "I don't regret kissing you."

Sophia's heart did something complicated. "No?"

"No. I regret the timing. The circumstances. My dad showing up. But I don't regret you."

"I don't regret you either."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They were quiet for a moment, just breathing on opposite ends of the phone line.

"What happens now?" Sophia asked.

"I have a meeting Monday with Coach Morrison and my parents. About my roster spot and my 'focus.' I need to convince them I'm committed to hockey."

"You are committed to hockey."

"But I'm also committed to you. And they can't coexist in their minds."

"So we're back to careful distance. Public separation. Pretending."

"I don't want to pretend anymore."

"But you have to."

"I know." He sounded defeated. "I hate this."

"Me too."

"We kissed, Sophie. In Jordan's art studio, we actually kissed. And it was perfect. And then my dad showed up and now I'm being threatened with prep school and nothing about this is fair."

"Life isn't fair. It's just optimized for different outcomes."

"That's a very physicist way of looking at it."

"It's the only way I know how to look at things."

Ethan laughed, tired but genuine. "I miss you. We're on the phone right now and I still miss you."

"I miss you too."

"Sleep on it?"

"What?"

"Whatever we're going to do about this. Sleep on it. Maybe tomorrow things will look different."

"Things won't look different tomorrow, Ethan. Your parents will still be controlling. Your roster spot will still be threatened. I'll still be the distraction everyone says I am."

"You're not a distraction. You're the person who makes me remember why I loved hockey in the first place."

Sophia closed her eyes. "That's the problem. They don't want you to love it. They want you to excel at it."

"Maybe I can do both."

"Or maybe you can't. Maybe excellence requires sacrifice."

"Then I'll sacrifice."

"What will you sacrifice?"

He didn't answer right away. Because they both knew what he was supposed to sacrifice. What his parents wanted him to sacrifice. Who.

"We'll figure it out," Ethan said finally. "Somehow."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"We'll figure it out."

"Together?"

"Together."

After they hung up, Sophia lay in the dark thinking about sacrifice and excellence and whether the two always had to go together. About Ethan's parents treating him like an investment portfolio to optimize. About her own parents and their expectations and whether she was doing the same thing—optimizing her life for someone else's vision of success.

She thought about kissing Ethan in Jordan's art studio. How it had felt right and terrifying simultaneously. How she'd stopped calculating for the first time in weeks and just felt.

Her phone buzzed one more time.

**E: Goodnight, Sophie**

**E: I don't regret you**

**S: I don't regret you either**

**S: Goodnight, Ethan**

She fell asleep in her Einstein wig, still wearing the remnants of a costume party that had ended too soon.

---

The weekend passed in a haze of homework and anxiety. Maya called four times, wanting details about what happened with Ethan. Sophia gave her the basic outline—his dad showed up, roster spot concerns, everything exploding.

"That's so fucked up," Maya said.

"That's his life."

"Doesn't make it less fucked up."

Sunday evening, Sophia tried to study for her physics test but couldn't focus. Every equation reminded her of something Ethan had said. Every problem about motion or forces made her think of particles with charge, attracted but not quite touching.

Monday morning arrived with the weight of everything unresolved.

Sophia got to school early, hoping to catch Ethan before his meeting with Coach Morrison and his parents. But his Jeep wasn't in the parking lot.

She checked her phone. No messages.

In physics class, his seat was empty.

Tyler noticed too. "He's at the meeting," he told her between classes. "Coach called him in first thing. His parents were already there."

"Do you know what it's about?"

"Officially? His commitment to the team. Unofficially?" Tyler lowered his voice. "They think he's distracted by a girl. Everyone knows it's you."

"We're just friends."

"Sure. And I'm just a casual hockey player." Tyler shook his head. "Look, I get it. You both like each other. But Ethan's got real opportunities. College scouts, pro potential. He can't fuck that up for a high school relationship."

"We're not in a relationship."

"You're something. And that something is affecting him."

Sophia wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that Ethan's stats were good, that he'd played well with the scout watching, that his supposed distraction hadn't actually impacted his performance.

But Tyler was already walking away, and Sophia was left standing in the hallway feeling like she'd just been blamed for something she couldn't control.

Ethan showed up at lunch, silent and tense. Jordan immediately pulled him aside. They talked in the corner of the cafeteria, Ethan's expression getting more and more closed off.

Then Jordan walked back to the table. "He needs space."

"What happened?" Maya asked.

"His parents doubled down. Roster spot is conditional on proving his commitment. No social distractions. All focus on hockey."

"That's ridiculous," Sophia said.

"That's the deal." Jordan looked at her sympathetically. "I'm sorry, Sophie. This isn't fair to either of you."

"Where is he?"

"He needs to be alone right now."

But Sophia couldn't just sit there. She found Ethan in the library, in the back corner where they used to study, sitting with his head in his hands.

"Hey," she said quietly.

He looked up. His eyes were red. "Hey."

"Can I sit?"

He nodded.

She sat across from him at their usual table. The physics textbook was still in her backpack, the one she'd planned to use if they studied together. Now it felt like evidence of something they weren't allowed to have.

"What did they say?" she asked.

"That my roster spot is being reevaluated. That I have two weeks to prove I'm committed to the team. No missed practices, no leaving early, no phone during breaks. Complete focus."

"That's not impossible."

"And no contact with you outside of school."

Sophia felt like she'd been punched. "What?"

"Coach Morrison didn't say it explicitly. But my dad did. After the meeting. In the parking lot." Ethan's voice was hollow. "He said if I'm serious about hockey, I need to eliminate distractions. And you're the distraction."

"We're in the same classes. We have the same friends."

"He said public interaction is fine. But no study sessions. No texts. No time alone together." Ethan finally looked at her. "He's monitoring my phone, Sophie. He installed some app that lets him see my messages."

"That's—he can't—" Sophia stopped, her mind racing. "Ethan, that's surveillance. That's a violation of your privacy."

"He says it's for my own good. To keep me focused."

"That's what abusers always say." The words came out sharper than she intended. "They dress it up as concern or protection, but it's about control."

Ethan flinched. "It's not—my parents aren't—"

"Aren't what? They're monitoring your phone. They're controlling who you can see. They're using money to manipulate you. What would you call it if this was happening to someone else?"

"He can do it. I'm seventeen and dependent on him for college funding. He can do whatever he wants."

"Just because he can doesn't mean it's right. And being financially dependent doesn't give them the right to control every aspect of your life."

Sophia's brain immediately started problem-solving. "Okay. So we don't text. We use a different app. Something he doesn't know about."

"He'll find out. He checks my phone randomly."

"Then we use school emails. Or we write notes. Or—"

"Sophia." Ethan reached across the table and took her hand. Just for a second, just a quick squeeze, before letting go in case someone saw. "We can't. Not for two weeks. Not until I prove my commitment and get my roster spot secured."

"So what? We just ignore each other?"

"We be friends in public. Study partners in class. Nothing that looks like more."

"We already were doing that."

"Now we have to do it for real. No private texts. No video calls about calc homework. No walks in the park. No ice cream. No—" His voice broke slightly. "No anything."

Sophia felt tears threatening and forced them back. She didn't cry. Crying was inefficient. Crying didn't solve problems.

"This isn't fair," she said.

"I know."

"You're being treated like you're their possession, not their son."

"I know."

"And I'm being blamed for making you happy, like that's a crime."

"I know, Sophie. I know all of it. And I hate it." Ethan's hands clenched on the table. "But I don't have a choice. If I don't comply, they send me to prep school. If they send me to prep school, I lose senior year here. With you. With Jordan. With everything that makes this bearable."

"So you comply and lose it anyway."

"For two weeks. Just two weeks to prove I'm focused. Then maybe things can go back to—" He stopped. "To whatever we were before."

"Academic collaboration partners who secretly care about each other but can't act on it?"

"Yeah. That."

"That was already terrible."

"I know."

They sat in silence. Around them, the library continued—students studying, staff shelving books, the normal rhythm of a Monday afternoon. Like their entire world wasn't collapsing.

"I'm sorry," Ethan said quietly. "For all of it. For kissing you Saturday night. For making this complicated. For having parents who—"

"Don't apologize for kissing me."

"But it made everything worse."

"It also made everything better. For exactly three minutes, everything was better." Sophia looked at him, really looked at him. "I don't regret it."

"Me neither."

"So we do this. Two weeks. Public distance. Proving focus."

"Yeah."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out what comes next."

The bell rang—warning for sixth period. They stood up simultaneously, careful not to touch, maintaining appropriate distance.

"See you in calc?" Ethan asked.

"Yeah. See you in calc."

He walked away first. Sophia waited thirty seconds before following, making it look casual. Making it look like they just happened to be in the library at the same time.

Making it look like her heart wasn't breaking.

---

The next two weeks were a masterclass in calculated distance.

Sophia sat across from Ethan in physics and calculus and didn't let herself look at him too long. They worked on problem sets in study group and kept conversation limited to mathematics. They passed in the hallways and exchanged polite nods like acquaintances instead of whatever they actually were.

Her phone stayed silent. No early morning texts. No late night study help. No random messages about things that reminded him of when they were kids.

Just silence.

Maya was furious on her behalf. "His parents are controlling assholes."

"They're protecting their investment."

"He's not an investment. He's a person." Maya's voice rose. "What they're doing is abusive, Sophie. You know that, right?"

"I know. But what can we do about it?"

"Has he talked to anyone? A counselor? A trusted adult?"

"Jordan said he suggested the school counselor, but Ethan won't go."

"Of course he won't. He's been taught that this is normal. That this is just how successful families operate." Maya shook her head. "My therapist says that's how emotional abuse works. It gets normalized until the victim can't even see it anymore."

"You talked to your therapist about this?"

"Not specifically about Ethan. But about the patterns. She gave me some resources about recognizing abuse in relationships—not just romantic ones, but family ones too. I could share them with you. Maybe you could share them with Ethan when he's ready."

"Maybe," Sophia said, though she wasn't sure Ethan would ever be ready to see his parents' behavior for what it really was.

"The school counselor knows, by the way," Maya added. "Mrs. Peterson. She can't do anything without Ethan coming forward, but she knows. She's watching. If he ever wants help, it's there."

"That's something, I guess."

"It's not enough. But it's something."

Sophia threw herself into training. Badminton practice became her escape—two hours where she could just hit shuttles and run drills and not think about brown eyes and Einstein costumes and kisses in art studios.

Coach Yun noticed. "Good intensity, Chen. Channel that into nationals."

But nationals felt far away. Nationals was January. January was three months. Three months of this careful distance, this calculated nothing, this optimization for other people's expectations.

The academic awards from the assembly were posted in the main hallway. Photo of her and Ethan on stage, along with other award recipients. Someone had written "PERFECT MATCH" in marker across it before a teacher removed it.

But the damage was done. Everyone saw. Everyone knew.

And Ethan's parents definitely saw.

Tyler reported that Ethan's practices were intense. "He's playing like someone's chasing him. Coach says it's the best he's looked all season."

"That's good," Sophia said.

"Is it though? If he's only playing well because he's miserable?"

She didn't have an answer to that.

Two weeks turned into ten days. Then a week. Then three days.

Friday afternoon of the second week, Ethan found her after school. "Can we talk?"

"Is talking allowed?"

"It's been two weeks. The deadline passed."

They went to his Jeep in the parking lot—public enough to be seen, private enough to speak freely.

"How did the roster reevaluation go?" Sophia asked.

"I'm still on the team. Spot secured." He didn't sound happy about it.

"That's good."

"Is it?"

"Isn't it what you wanted?"

"I wanted to play hockey because I love it. Not because I successfully proved I could ignore someone I care about for two weeks."

Sophia looked at him. He looked exhausted. Dark circles under his eyes, shoulders tense, holding himself together through pure force of will.

"We survived two weeks," she said.

"Barely."

"But we survived."

"So what now?"

That was the question. What now? Go back to how things were? Keep pretending they didn't care? Actually try to date publicly and deal with the fallout?

"I don't know," Sophia admitted.

"Me neither."

They sat in silence, the Friday afternoon parking lot gradually emptying around them. Students leaving for the weekend, heading to parties or jobs or homework or whatever normal teenagers did when their lives weren't complicated by parental ultimatums and roster spots and feelings that couldn't be optimized away.

"There's a party tonight," Ethan said. "At Tyler's house. His parents are away."

"Another party."

"I know. But maybe..." He trailed off.

"Maybe what?"

"Maybe we could try again. To have one normal night. No parents showing up. No emergencies. Just us and our friends and no pressure."

"Your parents will know if you go."

"I told them it's team bonding. Which is technically true. Half the hockey team will be there."

"Ethan—"

"I know it's risky. But I'm tired of careful distance and calculated nothing. I want one night where we don't have to pretend."

Sophia thought about risk assessment and probability and all the ways this could go wrong. Thought about his parents finding out, roster spots being reconsidered again, everything exploding a second time.

But she also thought about two weeks of silence. Two weeks of sitting across from him in physics and not being able to talk. Two weeks of her phone staying quiet and her heart feeling hollow.

"Okay," she said.

"Yeah?"

"One night. No pretending."

"No pretending," he agreed.

"But if your dad shows up again, I'm never going to another party for the rest of my life."

"Deal."

He smiled—the real smile, not the performance version. And Sophia felt something in her chest loosen.

Maybe they couldn't have forever. Maybe they couldn't even have next week. But they could have tonight.

That was enough.

It had to be enough.

---

Tyler's house was bigger than Jordan's, which meant the party was bigger. More people, louder music, the whole basement converted into a party space with a TV playing some hockey game on mute.

Sophia arrived with Maya and Sarah around eight. Ethan was already there, surrounded by hockey guys, looking more relaxed than she'd seen him in weeks.

He saw her across the room. Smiled.

She smiled back.

"You two are pathetic," Maya observed.

"We're subtle."

"You're the opposite of subtle."

"We're strategically obvious?"

"That's not a thing."

Jordan appeared with drinks. "The scientist twins return. No matching costumes tonight?"

"We learned our lesson," Sophia said.

"Did you though? Because you're both wearing flannel."

Sophia looked down at her flannel shirt. Looked at Ethan across the room in his flannel shirt. Different colors, but still.

"It's Winnipeg in November," she defended. "Everyone wears flannel."

"Sure. Everyone. Definitely not just you two coordinating outfits again."

"We didn't coordinate."

"The universe is shipping you," Jordan said seriously. "You can't fight the universe."

"I can absolutely fight the universe."

"That's very bold of you."

The party continued around them. Normal teenage chaos—people playing beer pong with water, someone trying to teach others a TikTok dance, Tyler's attempt at DJing that was questionable at best.

Sophia found herself naturally gravitating toward where Ethan was. Not obviously. Just casually ending up in the same conversations, the same room, the same general vicinity.

Around nine, they ended up on the back deck again. Different house, same pattern—needing air, needing space from the noise.

"Hi," Ethan said.

"Hi."

"We keep ending up on decks at parties."

"It's becoming a theme."

"Should we make it our signature move?"

"Deck conversations as a defining relationship characteristic?"

"We have to have something."

Sophia laughed. "True. Other couples have songs or restaurants. We have decks."

"Wait." Ethan looked at her. "Are we a couple?"

Her brain stuttered. "I don't... we haven't... that's not..."

"Smooth, Sophie. Very articulate."

"Shut up. You surprised me."

"By asking if we're a couple?"

"By using the word couple. We've been doing this whole thing where we don't define it."

"Maybe we should define it."

"Should we?"

"I want to." He moved closer. "These past two weeks were terrible. Not texting you was terrible. Pretending I didn't care was terrible. I don't want to do that anymore."

"But your parents—"

"Will find out eventually. They'll be mad. They'll threaten prep school again. But I'm tired of living my life around their threats."

"Ethan—"

"I like you, Sophia Chen. I like you so much it's kind of ridiculous. And I want to be able to say that. I want to hold your hand in the hallway. I want to drive you to school and not pretend it's just practical carpooling. I want to be your boyfriend, if you'll let me."

Sophia's cardiovascular system was doing complicated things again. "That's going to make everything harder."

"I know."

"Your parents will lose it."

"Probably."

"People at school will have opinions."

"Definitely."

"Becca will know for sure."

"I think she already knows."

"This is a terrible idea."

"The worst," he agreed. "So is that a yes?"

Sophia looked at him. Really looked. At the hope in his eyes and the fear underneath. At the way he was holding himself like he was braced for rejection but desperately wanting acceptance.

She thought about physics. About forces and motion and objects in equilibrium. About how sometimes the most stable state was actually dynamic balance—two forces perfectly opposed, creating stillness through constant tension.

But she also thought about phase transitions. About how sometimes stability gave way to change. How water became ice, how ice became water, how everything could be fundamentally altered while still being the same atoms.

Maybe that's what they were. A phase transition waiting to happen.

"Yes," she said.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Let's be a couple. Let's be terrible at hiding it and obvious about caring and whatever happens, happens."

Ethan's smile was incandescent. "That's very un-physicist-like of you. Very unoptimized."

"Maybe I'm tired of optimizing."

"That's character growth."

"Shut up and kiss me."

He did.

This time there was no hesitation. No almost-kiss followed by pulling back. Just them, on a deck at a party, finally admitting what they'd been circling for months.

When they broke apart, someone was whistling from inside. Tyler and Jordan and half the hockey team were watching through the window.

"We have an audience," Sophia noted.

"Let them watch."

"Your dad could find out."

"He's going to find out anyway. Might as well be because we stopped hiding."

They went back inside, hand in hand. The party erupted in cheers.

"FINALLY," Jordan yelled. "The tension was killing me."

"We're a couple now," Ethan announced. "Official. Public. Whatever."

"About damn time," Tyler said.

Maya hugged Sophia. "I'm happy for you. Even though his parents are going to be nightmares."

"They'll adjust."

"Or they'll send him to prep school."

"Maya—"

"I'm just being realistic. But also, I'm happy. You deserve happiness, even if it's complicated."

The rest of the party passed in a blur. Dancing with Ethan's arms around her waist. Sitting on the couch with his arm over her shoulders. Laughing with their friends like this was normal, like they were just regular teenagers at a regular party with regular uncomplicated lives.

Around eleven, Sophia's phone buzzed. Her mom asking when she'd be home.

"I should probably leave soon," she said.

"I'll drive you."

"You don't have to—"

"Sophie. I'm your boyfriend now. I can drive my girlfriend home."

The word girlfriend made her smile every time.

They said goodbye to everyone, got into Ethan's Jeep, drove through Winnipeg's late-night streets. The city was quiet, most people already home, streetlights reflecting off windows.

"So we're really doing this," Sophia said.

"We're really doing this."

"Your parents will find out."

"Probably by tomorrow, if Tyler posts anything on social media."

"Are you ready for that?"

"No. But I'm ready to stop hiding."

He pulled up to her house. Kissed her one more time before she got out.

"Goodnight, girlfriend," he said.

"Goodnight, boyfriend."

Sophia went inside, told her parents the party was fun, went to her room and lay in bed smiling at the ceiling like an idiot.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Thank you**

**S: For what?**

**E: For saying yes. For being you. For making me brave enough to stop optimizing for my parents' expectations.**

**S: We're both terrible at optimizing now**

**E: The best kind of terrible**

**S: Goodnight, Ethan**

**E: Goodnight, Sophie**

She fell asleep happy for the first time in two weeks.

---

Saturday morning, Sophia woke up to seventeen missed calls.

Most were from Ethan. Three were from Jordan. One was from Maya, left at 6:47 AM.

She called Maya back first.

"Oh good, you're alive," Maya said. "Have you talked to Ethan?"

"No. Why? What happened?"

"Tyler posted photos from last night. Tagged everyone. Including photos of you and Ethan kissing on the deck."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "Oh no."

"Oh yes. And apparently Ethan's dad follows Tyler on Instagram."

"No."

"Yes. He saw them. Called Ethan at six this morning. There's been a 'family meeting' happening since then."

Sophia was already getting dressed. "I need to—I don't know what I need to do."

"You need to call him. He's been trying to reach you."

She hung up with Maya and immediately called Ethan. He answered on the first ring.

"Sophie—"

"I just heard. I'm so sorry. I fell asleep with my phone on silent—"

"It's not your fault. It's Tyler's for posting. And mine for not being more careful."

"What did your parents say?"

"What do you think they said?" His voice was hollow. "That I'm throwing away my future. That I can't be trusted. That effective immediately, they're making changes."

"What kind of changes?"

"I'm transferring to prep school after Christmas break."

The words didn't make sense at first. Sophia heard them, but her brain refused to process them. She stared at him, waiting for him to say he was joking, that this was some terrible Halloween prank extending into the next morning.

But his face was serious. Broken.

"No." The word came out as a whisper. Then louder. "No, they can't—"

Her vision blurred. She was crying. When had she started crying? Her chest felt too tight, like someone had wrapped bands around her ribs and was pulling them tighter with each breath.

"Sophie—"

"What?" The word came out harsh, angry, not at him but at everything. "What do you mean? When? How?"

"Shattuck-St. Mary's in Minnesota. They called this morning. There's a spot available for second semester. My parents already paid the deposit."

"They can't just—"

"They can. And they did." Ethan's voice cracked. "I'm leaving in six weeks, Sophie."

"No. No, we'll figure something out. We'll talk to them. I'll talk to them. We'll—"

"There's nothing to figure out. They made the decision. I either go to prep school or I lose college funding. And without college funding, I can't go anywhere. I'm trapped."

Sophia sat down on her bed, phone pressed to her ear, trying to process.

Six weeks. They had six weeks.

"So what do we do?" she asked.

"I don't know. Make the most of six weeks? Try to change their minds, even though I know we can't? Break up now and save ourselves the pain?"

"I don't want to break up."

"I don't want to either."

"Then we have six weeks."

"Six weeks," Ethan repeated. "That's it. That's all we get."

"Then we make them count."

She could hear him breathing on the other end of the line. Could hear him trying to hold himself together.

"I'm sorry," he said finally. "This is all my fault. If I'd just—"

"Don't. Don't apologize for wanting happiness. Don't apologize for being with me."

"But if we hadn't—"

"Then you'd be playing hockey and going to prep school anyway, just without having had anything real. At least this way, we have six weeks."

"Six weeks isn't enough."

"No. But it's what we have."

They stayed on the phone, not talking, just existing together through the connection. Outside Sophia's window, Winnipeg was waking up—Saturday morning, people going about their lives, oblivious to the fact that hers had just been given an expiration date.

"Can I see you today?" Ethan asked.

"You're grounded, aren't you?"

"Completely. But my parents are going out this afternoon. Some meeting with the prep school admissions office via video call from home, then they're having dinner with Coach Morrison. I have the house to myself from two to seven."

"I'll be there at 2:01."

"Sophie—"

"We have six weeks, Ethan. I'm not wasting a single minute of it."

She hung up and sat there, processing. Six weeks. Forty-two days. Less than two months before he'd leave for Minnesota, for prep school, for a life orchestrated entirely by his parents.

Unless they could figure out something in that time.

But what? What could two seventeen-year-olds do against parents with money and control and absolute determination to direct their son's life?

Sophia did what she always did when faced with impossible problems: she started calculating.

Six weeks. Finals before Christmas break. Her badminton training. His hockey schedule. Overlapping time. Available moments. Risk factors. Probability of his parents changing their minds.

The numbers didn't look good.

But numbers weren't everything.

Sometimes you had to trust things that couldn't be quantified.

---

At 2:01 PM, Sophia pulled up to Ethan's house for the first time. She'd never been inside before—they'd always met at neutral locations, avoiding the parental complications of being in each other's homes.

Now she was standing on his front porch, about to enter the space where he lived under his parents' control, about to see up close what his life had been like all these months.

He opened the door before she could knock.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi."

They stood there for a moment. Then he pulled her inside and kissed her like they had all the time in the world instead of forty-two days.

His house was exactly what she expected—nice, organized, full of hockey trophies and family photos that looked professionally taken. The kind of house where everything had its place and expectations were high.

"Want to see my room?" Ethan asked.

"That sounds like a setup."

"It's not. I just want to show you my space."

His room was on the second floor. Also organized—bed made, desk clean, shelves full of hockey equipment and textbooks. But there were personal touches too. A poster of theoretical physicist Richard Feynman on one wall. A photo of him and Jordan as kids, gap-toothed and holding hockey sticks. A collection of rocks on the windowsill that he must have gathered over years.

And on his desk: the physics problem set they'd worked on together back in September, still sitting there with her handwriting in the margins.

"You kept it," Sophia said.

"Of course I kept it. It's the first time we studied together after you moved back."

She picked it up, looking at her own notes. *Remember: acceleration is the second derivative of position. Ethan, you need to set up the equation first before solving.*

"You were very patient with me," Ethan said, reading over her shoulder.

"You didn't need patience. You needed context."

"I needed you."

They sat on his bed—carefully, both aware of the implication but also of the short time they had. This wasn't about anything physical. This was about being together in his space, claiming this moment as theirs.

"Six weeks," Sophia said.

"Six weeks."

"We can make a plan. Maximize time together. Work around your schedule and mine."

"You're optimizing again."

"It's what I do."

"Or," Ethan said slowly, "we could just be together. No optimization. No calculation. Just... whatever happens."

Sophia looked at him. "That's very un-Ethan-like of you."

"I'm learning from the best."

"Who, me? I'm terrible at being unoptimized."

"You're learning too."

They lay back on his bed, side by side, staring at his ceiling. It was white, boring, nothing like the glow-in-the-dark stars Sophia had on hers.

"I'm going to miss you," Sophia said quietly.

"I'm not gone yet."

"But you will be. In six weeks, you'll be in Minnesota at some elite hockey prep school, and I'll be here."

"We'll figure it out. Long distance, or—"

"Long distance doesn't work when parents are actively trying to keep you apart."

"Sophie—"

"I'm being realistic. Your parents will monitor your phone, your email, everything. They're sending you away specifically to separate you from me. They're not going to make it easy to stay in touch."

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "So what do you want to do? Break up now? Save ourselves the pain?"

"No."

"Then what?"

"I want six weeks. I want every minute we can get. And then, when you leave, we'll deal with it then."

"That's very present-focused of you."

"I'm working on being less future-obsessed."

He turned to face her. "I don't want to lose you."

"Then don't. Figure out how to not lose me."

"That's not helpful."

"Neither is prep school, but here we are."

He laughed, sad but genuine. "We're a mess."

"The best kind of mess."

They stayed like that until his phone alarm went off at 6:30—warning that his parents would be home soon. Sophia left quickly, driving away before their car turned onto the street.

That night, lying in her own bed, she got a text.

**E: Thank you for today**

**S: Thank you for letting me in**

**E: I'll always let you in**

**S: That's a big promise when you're leaving in six weeks**

**E: Then I'll make it a bigger promise**

**E: I'll find a way back**

**E: I don't know how yet**

**E: But I will**

Sophia wanted to believe him. Wanted to trust that somehow, despite his parents' control and the physical distance and everything stacked against them, they'd figure it out.

But her physicist brain knew better. Knew that some forces were too strong to overcome. That sometimes, no matter how hard you fought, the system was rigged against you.

Still.

She had six weeks.

Forty-two days.

A thousand hours.

She'd make them count.

---

Monday morning, the school was buzzing with the news: Ethan Price was transferring to prep school after Christmas.

People had opinions. Of course they had opinions. Tyler was defensive about it—"He needs the elite training." Jordan was quietly furious—"His parents are controlling assholes." The girls who'd dated hockey players before had knowing looks—"That's what happens when you distract them from their career."

Becca found Sophia at her locker between classes.

"Hey," Becca said.

"Hey."

"I heard about prep school."

"Everyone heard about prep school."

"I'm sorry. I know you two were..." She paused. "Whatever you were."

"We are. Present tense. We have six weeks."

"That sucks."

"Yeah."

Becca was quiet for a moment. Then: "For what it's worth, I think his parents are wrong. He was happier with you than I ever saw him with me. That should count for something."

"It doesn't count for anything when parents control your entire life."

"No. I guess it doesn't." Becca touched her arm briefly. "Make the most of six weeks."

"That's the plan."

Sophia found Ethan at lunch. They sat together, publicly, not hiding. Because why hide now? Everyone knew. His parents knew. The secret was out.

"How's your day?" she asked.

"Long. Yours?"

"Also long."

"Want to study after school?"

"Your parents—"

"Are having dinner with their lawyer. Something about finalizing prep school paperwork. We have until eight."

"Library?"

"Your car. Privacy."

"My car it is."

They spent three hours in her car in the Tim Hortons parking lot where they'd had their first after-confession conversation. Did homework and talked and kissed and tried to pretend that every moment wasn't counting down.

This became their routine. Stolen hours between his schedule and hers. Study sessions in her car. Walks through Assiniboine Park as November turned colder. His hockey games where she sat in the stands and cheered and his parents watched her watching him.

---

By the second Wednesday of their countdown—day ten, not that she was obsessively tracking—things started fraying at the edges.

They were in Ethan's Jeep in the school parking lot after his practice. Forty-five minutes before his parents expected him home, which she knew because she'd memorized his schedule like exam dates.

"You're doing it again," Sophia said, frustrated.

"Doing what?"

"Shutting down. Going quiet. Acting like everything's fine when it's clearly not."

"I'm just tired from practice."

"No, you're not. Your dad said something. I saw him pull you aside after warm-ups."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "It doesn't matter."

"It does matter. We have five weeks left and you're already pulling away."

"I'm not pulling away."

"You are. You've barely looked at me for two days."

"Because they're watching!" His voice cracked with frustration. "My dad has been at every practice, every game. He times how long I talk to people. He asks the team manager who I eat lunch with. I can't even breathe without him analyzing it."

Sophia reached for his hand. He pulled back.

"Don't," he said. "Someone might see."

"So what? They already know. Everyone already knows."

"Knowing and seeing are different. If he sees—" Ethan stopped, running his hands through his hair. "He threatened to move the departure date up. Said if I can't maintain boundaries for six weeks, maybe I need to leave sooner."

The words hung between them like ice.

"I'm sorry," Sophia said quietly. "I didn't know."

"How could you? I didn't tell you. Because telling you makes it real and I'm trying so hard to pretend this is all normal when it's not, none of this is normal, and I hate that you're caught in the middle of it."

"Hey." She waited until he looked at her. "We're in this together. But you have to talk to me. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

"I know. I'm sorry. I just... sometimes I think it would be easier if we..."

"If we what?"

"Nothing. Forget it."

But she knew what he'd been about to say. Sometimes it would be easier if they ended it now.

The thought sat between them, unspoken but present.

---

Thanksgiving came faster than expected. Somewhere between the fight and the making up and trying to act normal at school, November slipped into its final week.

Sophia's house smelled like turkey and her mom's famous stuffing. Her extended family filled the dining room, aunts and uncles and cousins she hadn't seen since moving back.

"So," her Aunt Linda said, "your mom mentioned you have a boyfriend. The hockey player?"

Sophia felt her parents' attention sharpen even as they pretended to be focused on their plates.

"Yes," she said simply.

"The one whose family is sending him away?" Her uncle's tone was sympathetic but probing.

"To prep school. For one semester."

"That must be hard," Aunt Linda said. "Long distance at your age rarely works out."

"Linda," Sophia's mom warned.

"I'm just being realistic. These teenage relationships, they burn bright but they don't last. Especially with that kind of distance."

Sophia set down her fork. "We're not most teenage relationships."

"Of course you're not, dear. You never are when you're in them."

Later, helping with dishes, Sophia's mom said quietly, "Don't listen to Linda. She's bitter about her own divorce."

"Is she wrong though? About teenage relationships not lasting?"

Her mom was quiet for a moment, drying a plate with careful attention. "Most don't. But some do. The ones built on real connection, real understanding. The ones where both people are willing to fight for it."

"His parents have all the power."

"For now. But that won't always be true." Her mom looked at her. "The question is whether you're both willing to wait for that to change."

---

The weekend tournament came at the worst possible time—three weeks left, his parents watching everything, and Sophia desperately needing to win something, anything, to feel like she had control.

She stood on the podium, gold medal around her neck, scanning the crowd. Her parents were there, beaming. Maya and Sarah cheering loudly. Jordan taking pictures.

But no Ethan.

She knew why. His game was at the same time, across the city. His parents would never let him miss it for her tournament.

Still, it stung.

Later, in her room, she stared at the medal. Her phone buzzed.

**E: Heard you destroyed everyone. Obviously.**

She sent him a photo of the medal.

**E: I'm so proud of you**

**E: I wish I could have been there**

**S: I know. It's okay.**

**E: It's not okay. Nothing about this is okay.**

**S: Two more weeks**

**E: Two more weeks**

But what then? This was just the beginning of missed moments. If he was in Minnesota for five months, how many tournaments would he miss? How many games would she not see? How many everything?

She put the medal in her drawer and tried not to think about it.

---

December hit like a slap. Suddenly it was the 15th and she was counting down on her fingers—thirteen days, that's it, how was it already—

They were in his room. His parents at another lawyer meeting, the house empty for maybe an hour. They'd been kissing on his bed, careful at first, then less careful, then his hands were in her hair and she forgot what careful even meant.

"Wait," Ethan said suddenly, pulling back.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Everything. I just..." He sat up, creating distance between them. "This is torture."

"What is?"

"Being with you knowing I have to leave. Kissing you knowing we have less than two weeks. Getting closer when we should be preparing for distance."

"So what are you saying?"

"I don't know. Maybe we should... maybe this would be easier if we started creating distance now. Emotional distance. So it doesn't hurt so much when—"

"No." Sophia's voice was sharp. "Don't you dare."

"Sophie—"

"We have thirteen days. I'm not wasting them on fake distance to make it easier. Nothing's going to make this easier."

"But if we—"

"If we what? Pretend we don't care? Act like we're already broken up? How does that help?"

"I don't know!" His voice cracked. "I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to love you and leave you at the same time."

The words hung there. Love. First time he'd said it outside of their later scene.

"You love me?" Sophia asked quietly.

"Of course I love you. How could I not love you? You're brilliant and stubborn and you make terrible physics jokes and you remember how I take my coffee and you're the only person who's ever made me want something more than hockey." He looked at her, eyes wet. "I love you and it's destroying me because I have to leave."

"Then don't leave."

"You know I can't—"

"Then we make the most of thirteen days. We don't create fake distance. We don't practice being apart. We just... be together. While we can."

Ethan pulled her back into his arms, holding her like she might disappear.

"Okay," he whispered. "Okay."

Finals week approached. They studied together in the library, surrounded by other stressed students, trying to focus on calculus and physics while acutely aware that every day brought them closer to goodbye.

"What if I just don't go?" Ethan said during a calc study session.

"To prep school?"

"Yeah. What if I refuse?"

"They'll pull college funding."

"So I'll figure out college without them. Scholarships, loans, whatever."

"Ethan—"

"I'm serious. What's the point of going to college if I'm not even living my own life? If I'm just following the script they wrote?"

Sophia looked at him. Really looked. At the frustration and fear and desperate need for autonomy.

"You're not thinking clearly," she said gently.

"I'm thinking perfectly clearly. They can't control me forever."

"But they can control you now. And fighting them now means losing everything—college, hockey, all of it."

"Maybe it's worth losing."

"It's not. You love hockey. You're good at it. Going to prep school sucks, but it's one semester. One semester of elite training, and then you're back senior year."

"Am I though? Or will they find another reason to send me away? Another way to control where I go and what I do?"

Sophia didn't have an answer to that.

Four weeks down. Two to go.

Christmas was coming. Finals were finished. Winter break started Friday. Ethan was leaving December 28th—the day after his birthday.

They celebrated his eighteenth birthday early, on the 26th. Just the two of them, at Assiniboine Park, walking through the snow.

"You're legally an adult now," Sophia said.

"Legally. Not financially."

"Still. That's something."

"Is it though? I'm eighteen and still under their complete control."

"For now."

"For now," he agreed.

She gave him his present: a photo of them from Jordan's Halloween party, before everything exploded. Before the kiss and the confrontation and prep school. Both of them in their matching science costumes, smiling like they didn't know what was coming.

"I love it," he said.

"It's corny."

"It's perfect."

He gave her his present: a notebook. On the first page, he'd written:

*For Sophia:*

*Document your physics discoveries here.*

*Prove that some things are too beautiful to optimize.*

*Remember that energy can't be created or destroyed, just transformed.*

*Remember that we're not ending. We're just changing form.*

*- E*

Sophia held the notebook and tried not to cry.

"That's very scientific of you," she managed.

"I learned from the best."

They kissed in the falling snow, and Sophia memorized everything: the cold on her face, the warmth of his hands, the way the streetlights made the snowflakes glow. The way this felt like an ending even though he wasn't gone yet.

December 27th was his last day in Winnipeg.

They spent it together. All day. Drove around the city visiting places that mattered—Granite Curling Club where they learned to skate, St. Paul's where they'd reunited, The Forks where he'd confessed, Assiniboine Park where they'd had so many conversations.

"I'm going to miss this," Ethan said as they sat in his Jeep, watching the sun set over the city.

"You'll be back for second semester senior year."

"If they let me come back."

"They will. This is temporary."

"What if it's not? What if prep school is just the first step? What if they find a way to keep me there, or send me to some college far away, or—"

"Ethan." Sophia took his hand. "Don't catastrophize."

"I'm being realistic."

"You're being scared."

"Aren't you scared?"

"Terrified," she admitted. "But I'm choosing to believe we'll figure it out."

"That's very optimistic of you."

"I'm learning."

They drove to Assiniboine Park one more time. The parking lot was almost empty—too cold for most people, the sun already setting at 4:30. They walked to their usual bench, the one where they'd sat so many times before.

"Sophie," Ethan said, his voice different. Heavier. "I need to tell you—I have to—"

Her heart started racing. "That sounds ominous."

"It's not. Or maybe—fuck, I don't know." He turned to face her fully, grabbing both her hands. His were shaking. Actually shaking. "I've been trying to figure out when to—how to—shit, this is coming out wrong."

"Ethan—"

"Just let me—I can't leave without—tomorrow morning I'll be in that car and—" He stopped. Started laughing, but it sounded more like he might cry. "God, I practiced this. Had a whole speech. And now I'm just—"

He took a shaky breath. She could see him trying to gather courage, failing, trying again.

"I love you, Sophie."

The words came out in a rush, like if he didn't say them fast they'd get stuck.

Sophia's brain just... stopped. Like someone pulled the plug. All her equations, all her—she couldn't even—

"You don't have to—I mean, fuck, I know it's fast. Six weeks, that's nothing, but I've felt—since you came back, or maybe when you fixed my derivative that first day and called me an idiot but like, fondly? Or when you remembered the hot chocolate thing and I just—"

"Ethan—"

"And tomorrow I'm leaving and this timing is shit and I probably shouldn't even—"

"I love you too."

He stopped mid-word. Mouth still open. "What?"

"I love you too." The words came out broken, half-sob, half-laugh. "I've been trying not to—trying to make it make sense but nothing about this makes sense and I can't—I can't make it logical—"

"Sophie..." His voice cracked completely.

"I love how you—God, this is so stupid—you remember everyone's coffee orders. Everyone's. Who does that? And you quote movies when I'm sad and you're trying so fucking hard to be yourself when everyone wants you to be this perfect—" She was definitely crying now, tears freezing on her face, probably looking like a disaster. "I love you and I'm terrified because you're leaving and I don't—how am I supposed to—"

Ethan pulled her into his arms, and they held each other on that bench in the freezing cold, both crying, both laughing at themselves for crying.

"This is so dramatic," Sophia said against his shoulder. "We're being those people."

"I don't care." He pulled back to look at her face. "I love you, Sophia Chen. Distance doesn't change that."

"I love you, Ethan Price. Even if your parents hate me."

"Especially because my parents hate you."

She laughed, watery but real. "That's a terrible reason."

"I have better ones." He wiped tears from her cheeks with his thumbs. "Remember this, okay? When things get hard. When my parents try to keep us apart. When five months feels like forever. Remember that we said this. Here. Together."

"I'll remember."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

They drove back to her house in comfortable silence, hands intertwined over the center console. Sat in his Jeep in her driveway, neither wanting to be the first to leave.

"This isn't goodbye," Ethan said.

"It's not?"

"It's 'see you later.' Goodbye is permanent. This isn't permanent."

"See you later then."

"See you later, Sophie."

He kissed her one more time. Long, slow, memorizing. Like he was trying to store enough kisses to last five months. When they finally pulled apart, they were both crying again.

"I love you," he whispered.

"I love you too," she whispered back.

Then she got out of his Jeep and walked to her door, didn't look back because if she looked back she'd never be able to let him leave.

Inside, her mom was waiting.

"Are you okay, sweetie?"

"No. But I will be."

She went to her room, opened the notebook Ethan had given her, and wrote on the second page:

*December 27th. The day before he leaves.*

*Energy can't be created or destroyed. Just transformed.*

*I'm choosing to believe we're transforming, not ending.*

*I'm choosing to believe in phase transitions and new equilibriums.*

*I'm choosing to believe in forces too strong to break.*

*I'm choosing to believe in us.*

That night, she got a text.

**E: I'm sorry**

**S: For what?**

**E: Everything. My parents. Prep school. Six weeks not being enough.**

**S: Nothing to apologize for**

**E: I'll come back**

**E: Somehow**

**E: I promise**

**S: I believe you**

**S: Now go to sleep. You have a long drive tomorrow.**

**E: Goodnight, Sophie**

**E: I don't regret you**

**E: Not for a second**

**S: I don't regret you either**

**S: Goodnight, Ethan**

She fell asleep holding her phone, the notebook open on her chest, trying to believe in transformations.

---

December 28th, 6:47 AM.

Sophia woke to her phone buzzing.

**E: We're leaving**

**E: This sucks**

**S: I know**

**S: Drive safe**

**E: I'll text when we get there**

**E: Six hours to Minnesota**

**E: Longest six hours of my life**

**S: Still shorter than six weeks**

**E: True**

**E: I have to go**

**E: They're calling**

**S: Go**

**S: I'm here when you get there**

**E: Promise?**

**S: Promise**

**E: Okay**

**E: I love you**

**E: I know we said it yesterday but I needed to say it again**

**E: Before the distance makes everything harder**

Sophia stared at her phone. Even though they'd said it yesterday, seeing it written still made her heart race.

She typed: **I love you t**

Deleted it. Started again: **Me too, always**

Deleted that. Just sent:

**S: ❤️**

Then immediately typed:

**S: GO before your parents get suspicious**

**S: I mean it Ethan GO**

But the message showed as delivered, not read. He was already in the car, already driving away, already leaving.

Sophia lay in bed and stared at her ceiling and tried to remember what Ethan had written: *Energy can't be created or destroyed. Just transformed.*

They weren't ending.

They were just transforming.

She had to believe that.

She had to.

Her phone buzzed again.

But it wasn't Ethan.

It was Jordan.

**Jordan: Ethan's gone?**

**S: Just left**

**Jordan: You okay?**

**S: Ask me in six months**

**Jordan: Fair**

**Jordan: For what it's worth, I think he'll find his way back**

**Jordan: He always does**

Sophia wanted to believe that.

But as December 28th turned into December 29th, as the days passed without messages because his parents were monitoring his phone, as the first week at prep school came and went with only brief, careful texts that said nothing real...

Sophia started to wonder if transformation looked a lot like ending after all.

---

**January 2nd, 11:23 PM**

Sophia's phone lit up with a FaceTime call from an unknown number.

She almost didn't answer.

But something made her click accept.

Ethan's face appeared on screen. He was in a dorm room, sitting on a basic bed, wearing a Shattuck-St. Mary's hockey hoodie.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey. Unknown number?"

"Borrowed my roommate's phone. Mine's being monitored."

"Isn't that against the rules?"

"Probably. But I had to see you."

Sophia's heart did complicated things. "How is it?"

"It's... intense. The training is insane. The academics are rigorous. Everyone here is good at hockey, which is different from being the best guy on a regular team."

"Are you okay?"

"I miss you. Is that an answer?"

"It's an answer."

They looked at each other through their screens. He was 407 miles away. Six hours by car. A different state. A different life.

"I meant what I said," Ethan said quietly. "Before I left. In the text."

"I meant it too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"This is temporary, Sophie. One semester. I'll be back in May for senior year."

"That's five months away."

"I know. But it's not forever. It's just a phase."

"A really long phase."

"A really long, terrible phase that we're going to survive because we're both too stubborn to give up."

Sophia laughed despite herself. "Is that your plan? Stubborn persistence?"

"It's worked so far."

"Has it though?"

"I'm still here. You're still there. We're still us. That's something."

"That's something," she agreed.

They talked for an hour, about nothing and everything. His classes, her winter break, Jordan's newest art project, Maya's theory that they were star-crossed lovers and should lean into the drama.

At 12:30, Ethan's roommate knocked on the door—curfew was coming, needed his phone back.

"I have to go," Ethan said.

"I know."

"I'll call when I can."

"I know."

"Sophie?"

"Yeah?"

"We're not over. This isn't the end."

"I know that too."

"Good. Don't forget it."

"You too."

The call ended.

Sophia sat in her dark room, staring at her blank phone screen, and opened the notebook Ethan had given her.

She wrote:

*January 2nd. Five months until he comes home.*

*We're not over.*

*We're transforming.*

*Phase transitions take time.*

*I can wait.*

*I will wait.*

She closed the notebook and tried to believe her own words.

Tried to believe in forces too strong to break.

Tried to believe in transformations instead of endings.

Tried to believe in them.

**CLIFFHANGER:**

*Unknown number calling again.*

*January 3rd, 6:15 AM.*

*Too early for Ethan.*

*Sophia answered.*

*Jordan's voice, urgent: "Sophie. Don't freak out. But Ethan's dad just showed up at my house. He's asking questions about you two. About the party. About everything. He knows more than Ethan thinks he knows."*

*"What do you mean?"*

*"I mean he's been investigating. Talking to people. Building a case. He's not just sending Ethan to prep school to separate you—"*

*"Then why?"*

*Jordan's pause was too long.*

*"Jordan. Why?"*

*"He's trying to prove you're the reason Ethan's 'unfocused.' He's building documentation. For legal emancipation prevention."*

*"What?"*

*"Ethan turned eighteen. Legally he could leave their control. His dad is preemptively building a case that Ethan's judgment is impaired. That he's being negatively influenced. That they need to maintain control."*

*"That's... that's illegal. That's coercion. That's—"*

*"That's abuse, Sophie. Financial abuse, emotional abuse, psychological abuse. And now they're trying to make it legal abuse." Jordan's voice was urgent. "But here's the thing—if we document it, if we build our own case, Ethan might have grounds for emancipation despite their efforts."*

*Sophia's blood ran cold, then hot with anger.*

*"Why are you telling me this?"*

*"Because Ethan doesn't know. And I think we need to do something. My mom's a family lawyer. She says what they're doing crosses lines. Real legal lines. But Ethan has to be willing to fight back."*

*"He won't. He's been conditioned to think this is normal."*

*"Then we need to show him it's not. Document everything. Every threat, every control tactic, every violation of his privacy. Build a case that shows he's not the one with impaired judgment—they are."*

*Sophia sat in her dark room, phone pressed to her ear, facing a different kind of choice.*

*Help Ethan see the truth about his situation and fight for his freedom.*

*Or let him stay trapped in a cycle of abuse he couldn't even recognize.*

*"Sophie? You still there?"*

*"Yeah. I'm here."*

*"What are you going to do?"*

*"I'm going to fight. Not just for us. For him. For his right to make his own choices."*

*"Even if he's not ready to fight for himself?"*

*"Especially then. Someone has to show him this isn't normal. This isn't love. This is abuse."*

And that was the question.

What was she going to do?
