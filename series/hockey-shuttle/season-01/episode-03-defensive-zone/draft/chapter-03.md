# CHAPTER 3: Tournament Weekend

Sunday afternoon, Sophia was showering off the exhaustion of yesterday's tournament when her phone rang. She almost didn't hear it over the water, but when she got out and checked, she had three missed calls from Ethan and a text.

**E: Are you alive?**

**E: Should I be worried?**

**E: I'm picking you up in 45 minutes whether you respond or not**

She called him back, still wrapped in a towel, hair dripping.

"Hey," she said when he answered.

"Oh good, you're not dead."

"Why would I be dead?"

"You weren't answering. I thought maybe you'd collapsed from athletic exhaustion."

"I was in the shower."

There was a pause. Then: "Right. Shower. Normal post-tournament activity."

Was he blushing? She couldn't tell over the phone, but something in his voice suggested he was blushing.

"Still picking me up at 1?" she asked.

"Unless you're too tired?"

"I'm never too tired for—" She stopped. For what? For him? For whatever this was between them?

"For celebration ice cream?" Ethan supplied. "Because I promised you celebration ice cream."

"You didn't promise ice cream."

"I'm promising it now. Get dressed. Warm clothes. It's freezing out."

He hung up before she could respond.

Forty-five minutes later, Sophia was waiting by her front window when his Jeep pulled up. She grabbed her coat and was out the door before he could come to get her—her parents were home, and the last thing she needed was them meeting Ethan while whatever this was remained undefined.

"Hey," she said, climbing into the passenger seat.

"Hey yourself, provincial silver medalist."

"Don't."

"Don't what? Be proud of you?"

"Don't make a big thing of it."

"Sophia Chen, you got second in the province and qualified for nationals. I'm making the biggest thing of it." He pulled away from her house. "Also, you look exhausted."

"Thanks?"

"It's a good look. Like you fought a battle and won."

"I lost the finals."

"You won silver. That's not losing."

They drove through Winnipeg's Sunday afternoon traffic—light, everyone either at church or sleeping off the weekend. The sky was that particular shade of gray that meant snow was coming soon. Maybe not today, but this week. Winter announcing itself.

"Where are we going?" Sophia asked.

"You'll see."

"That's ominous."

"It's mysterious. There's a difference."

They ended up at BDI, an ice cream place near the university. In October. When it was 4 degrees Celsius outside.

"We're getting ice cream in October," Sophia observed.

"Champions get ice cream regardless of temperature."

"I'm not a champion. I'm a runner-up."

"Sophie." He turned off the engine and looked at her. "Stop doing that."

"Doing what?"

"Diminishing what you accomplished. You trained for months. You played eight matches yesterday—"

"Seven."

"Seven matches. You beat almost everyone in the province. You're going to nationals. That's not 'runner-up.' That's elite athlete."

Something in her throat felt tight. "Rachel Morrison is better than me."

"Right now. But you're a junior. She's a senior who's been training nationally for years. Give yourself credit for getting close."

"I don't want to get close. I want to win."

"I know." His voice was soft. "Trust me, I know that feeling. But you can want to win and still be proud of what you did achieve."

Sophia looked at him. Really looked. Ethan Price, who'd been groomed for hockey excellence since he was seven, whose parents had mapped out his entire athletic career, who probably hadn't been allowed to just be proud of "good enough" ever in his life.

"Do you do that?" she asked. "Feel proud of good achievements even when they're not perfect?"

"I'm learning to." He smiled, a little sad. "Mostly from watching you work. You love physics because it's beautiful, not because you have to be the best physicist. You chose badminton because you enjoyed it, not because someone invested your college fund in it. You're allowed to just be excellent for its own sake."

"But I—"

"Sophia. Please. Just let me buy you ice cream and celebrate your silver medal."

She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.

They went inside. Sophia got maple walnut because it felt appropriately Canadian. Ethan got chocolate peanut butter because apparently he had the taste preferences of a twelve-year-old.

"This is objectively the best flavor," he defended, sitting across from her at a small table.

"It's the flavor of someone who never evolved past elementary school ice cream socials."

"You're just jealous of my superior taste."

"I'm absolutely not."

"Maple walnut is what old people get."

"Maple walnut is what people with refined palates get."

"You sound seventy."

"You sound twelve."

He grinned at her, and Sophia felt something in her chest do a complicated flip.

"Tell me about the finals match," Ethan said. "For real. Not just 'I lost.'"

So she did. Described the rallies, Morrison's incredible defense, the moment she realized she was outmatched. How Coach Yun had told her to vary her play, how she'd tried, how it almost worked.

"I could see what I needed to do," Sophia said. "I understood the strategy. But my body couldn't execute fast enough. There was this gap between knowing and doing."

"That's experience. You'll close that gap."

"You sound like my dad."

"Your dad sounds smart."

"He is. He keeps trying to tell me that silver is impressive, but all I can think is that I was eight points away from gold. Eight points across two games. If I'd just played a little better—"

"Stop," Ethan said gently. "You can analyze for improvement, but don't torture yourself with what-ifs."

"Do you do that? After games?"

"All the time. Every mistake, every missed opportunity. Jordan has to physically stop me from rewatching game footage sometimes."

"So you're telling me to do something you don't do?"

"I'm telling you to do something I'm trying to learn to do." He reached across the table, and for a second Sophia thought he was going to take her hand. But he just nudged her ice cream cup. "Eat your old-person flavor and accept that you're amazing."

"I'm not—"

"Sophie. Second in the province. Qualified for nationals. Amazing."

She ate her ice cream and tried to believe him.

"What about you?" she asked. "Your scout game. Three points."

"Yeah." Ethan's expression shifted, something complicated crossing his face. "The scout wants to meet with me and my parents next week. He said I'm on their 'serious interest' list for recruitment."

"That's huge."

"It's terrifying."

"You're incredible at hockey. You should be recruited."

"My parents are already planning my future. They had the scout over for dinner last night. Spent two hours talking about training philosophy and academic standards and whether I should consider prep school for senior year to strengthen my application."

Sophia's ice cream suddenly tasted like nothing. "Prep school? Like boarding school?"

"There are hockey prep schools that specifically train for college recruitment. Some of the guys on elite teams do a fifth year of high school at prep schools to develop more."

"Would you want that?"

"No. But I don't know if what I want matters."

They sat in silence, the cheerful ice cream shop atmosphere suddenly feeling incongruous with the weight of what he was saying.

"I'm sorry," Sophia said.

"For what?"

"That your parents are..." She searched for the right word. "Intense."

"That's diplomatic."

"I'm trying not to say 'controlling.'"

"You can say it. It's accurate." Ethan pushed his ice cream around with his spoon. "They're not bad people. They just have very specific ideas about what my life should look like."

"And you don't get a vote?"

"I get to vote in favor of their ideas." He said it like a joke, but Sophia heard the edge underneath.

"Ethan—"

"It's fine. This is what we signed up for, right? Both of us. High-achieving children of invested parents. This is the trade-off."

"It doesn't have to be."

"Doesn't it though?" He looked at her. "Your parents moved here for better opportunities. Mine invested everything in my training. We both have expectations to meet."

"My parents want me to be happy."

"Mine want me to be successful. They think it's the same thing."

Sophia didn't know what to say to that. Because her parents did want her to be happy—but they also had expectations. Good grades, good university, good career. The happiness was supposed to come from achieving those things.

"Do you want to play college hockey?" she asked.

"I don't know anymore. I used to. When it was just fun, when you and I were kids learning to skate at Granite, before scouts and rankings and recruitment." He met her eyes. "You were there when I fell in love with hockey. Remember? You were terrible at skating."

"Thanks for the reminder."

"But you kept trying. And you'd laugh every time you fell. You made it fun. Made me remember it was supposed to be fun." His voice got quieter. "That's what I miss. The fun. The joy of just playing."

"You can still have that."

"Can I though? With scouts watching and parents planning and everyone waiting for me to either succeed or fail spectacularly?"

Sophia reached across the table and did take his hand this time. Wrapped her fingers around his and squeezed.

"Yes," she said firmly. "You can. Because hockey is beautiful and you're beautiful at it, and no amount of pressure can take that away unless you let it."

Ethan looked at their joined hands on the table. His thumb moved against her knuckles—small movement, deliberate.

"We're holding hands in public," he said.

"We're friends celebrating achievements. Friends can hold hands."

"Can they?"

"I'm deciding they can."

He smiled. "Okay then. Friends who hold hands."

"Exactly."

They finished their ice cream like that, hands linked across the table, talking about nothing important. Classes and homework and Maya's new obsession with true crime podcasts and Jordan's upcoming art show.

Normal teenage conversation. Except for the electric current running through their joined hands.

When they finally left, the sun was lower in the sky, the air colder. Ethan drove her home slowly, like he was trying to extend the afternoon as long as possible.

He pulled up in front of her house but didn't immediately let her get out.

"Sophia?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for today. For letting me celebrate with you."

"Thanks for making me celebrate."

"I mean it. You're..." He paused, searching for words. "You're one of the most incredible people I know. And I'm not just saying that because I—" He stopped.

"Because you what?"

"Because I care about you. A lot."

Her heart rate elevated approximately 40%.

"I care about you too," she said quietly.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They looked at each other. His hand was on the gear shift, hers on her backpack strap. The space between them was maybe eighteen inches.

"I should go in," Sophia said.

"You should."

"My parents are probably watching."

"Definitely watching."

Neither of them moved.

"We're doing it again," Ethan said.

"Doing what?"

"The thing where we know we should maintain distance but we don't want to."

"Oh. That thing."

"Yeah."

Sophia forced herself to open the car door. "Text me later?"

"Always."

She got out, walked to her front door, turned back to wave. He was still watching, smiling that private smile that was just for her.

Inside, her mom was in the kitchen. "That was the hockey boy?"

"His name is Ethan."

"He seems nice. Your father wants to meet him."

"We're just friends, Mom."

"Friends who take you for ice cream and look at you like you're the most interesting thing they've ever seen?"

"Mom—"

"I'm just observing." But she was smiling. "Go do your homework. Dinner in an hour."

Sophia went to her room and flopped on her bed. Her phone buzzed immediately.

**E: Your mom was definitely watching through the window**

**S: Both my parents were watching**

**E: Embarrassing?**

**S: So embarrassing**

**E: For the record, your mom has good taste in observing things**

**S: What does that mean?**

**E: Nothing**

**E: Just that you're interesting to look at**

**E: At**

**E: Interesting to look AT**

**E: I'm stopping now**

Sophia laughed into her pillow.

**S: You're an idiot**

**E: An idiot who bought you ice cream**

**S: The best kind of idiot**

**E: I'll take it**

She set her phone down and stared at her ceiling. Today had been good. Simple. Just two people getting ice cream and talking and holding hands because they wanted to.

Tomorrow they'd go back to school and careful distance and public performance. But today had been theirs.

That was enough.

It had to be enough.

---

Monday morning brought reality back with force.

Sophia walked into school to find posters in the hallway announcing the academic awards assembly. Wednesday morning, all-school mandatory attendance, recognizing students for academic achievement.

Her name was on the list: Top marks in AP Physics, AP Calculus, and Honor Roll.

So was Ethan's: Mathematics Achievement Award, Honor Roll, and something called the Scholar-Athlete Recognition.

"Fancy," Maya said, appearing at her locker. "You're getting awards."

"It's just recognition for grades."

"It's recognition for being a genius. Take the compliment."

"I'm not a genius. I just work hard."

"Sophia. You're taking two AP science courses simultaneously while training for badminton nationals. You're a genius."

Tyler walked past and overheard. "Wait, you're getting academic awards?"

"So is Ethan," Sophia said.

"Yeah, but Ethan's been getting those forever. His parents make him." Tyler looked at her with something like respect. "You're actually smart smart. Not just study-hard smart."

"Those are the same thing."

"They're really not." He continued down the hallway, leaving Sophia confused.

Jordan found her and Maya at lunch. "Academic assembly Wednesday. You know what that means?"

"Free period out of class?" Maya suggested.

"It means Ethan's parents will be there." Jordan looked at Sophia. "They come to everything that's public recognition. They'll see you getting awards."

"So?"

"So maybe they'll start seeing you as something other than 'the distraction.'" He stole a fry from Maya's tray. "You're ranked second in provincial badminton, top of your class academically, and you're going to be on stage with Ethan receiving awards. That's peer-level achievement. Hard to argue you're derailing him when you're excelling at the same things."

Sophia hadn't thought about it that way.

"Unless they just get more threatened," Maya said. "Some parents don't want their kids to have peer-level partners. They want them to have subordinate-level partners who'll support from the sidelines."

"Maya," Jordan said, "you're a ray of sunshine."

"I'm realistic."

But Maya's words stuck with Sophia through the afternoon. What if excelling just made Ethan's parents more determined to keep them apart? What if being excellent wasn't enough?

After school, she had badminton practice. Coach Yun worked them hard, already planning for nationals in January.

"Chen, your footwork is getting sloppy," Coach called. "Tighten it up."

Sophia focused, moved through the drills. Lunges, jumps, lateral movements. Her legs still ached from Saturday's tournament, but she pushed through.

"Better," Coach approved. "You played well Saturday. But Morrison exposed your weaknesses. We need to work on your defensive returns."

"Yes, Coach."

They spent an hour on defensive drills. Sophia returning smash after smash, learning to absorb the power and redirect it. By the end of practice, her arms felt like jelly.

In the locker room, one of her teammates—Jasmine, a sophomore—approached her. "Hey, is it true you're friends with Ethan Price?"

"Um. Yeah?"

"That must be weird now. With him and Becca breaking up."

"It's fine."

"Some people are saying you're the reason they broke up."

Sophia went very still. "What?"

"Just rumors. You know how people talk." Jasmine shrugged. "I mean, you guys do study together a lot. And you moved here right before they broke up."

"We're friends. That's all."

"Sure. I'm just saying what people are saying."

She left, and Sophia sat on the locker room bench feeling sick.

Maya was waiting outside when she emerged. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"People are saying I broke up Ethan and Becca."

"People are idiots."

"But what if they're right? What if I did?"

"Sophia." Maya grabbed her shoulders. "Ethan and Becca were ending anyway. You didn't break them up. You just existed, and he realized he wanted different things. That's not your fault."

"It feels like my fault."

"That's because you're a good person who thinks too hard about everything." Maya steered her toward the parking lot. "Come on. Sarah and I are getting bubble tea. You're coming."

"I have homework—"

"Homework can wait. Friendship emotional support is happening now."

They ended up at Nuvo Bubble Tea on Pembina Highway. Sarah was already there, had ordered their usual drinks, and had claimed a corner table.

"Rough day?" Sarah asked when they sat down.

"People are talking," Sophia said.

"People are always talking. Ignore them."

"Easier said than done when they're talking about you being a homewrecker."

"You're not a homewrecker," Maya said firmly. "You're a person. Ethan's a person. Becca's a person. Sometimes people's feelings change. That's life, not drama."

"Try telling that to the entire school."

"I will. Literally. I'll make an announcement."

"Please don't."

"I'm very good at announcements."

"Maya—"

"Fine. But I reserve the right to glare menacingly at anyone who says shit about you."

Sophia laughed despite herself. "Deal."

They talked about other things—Sarah's college application stress, Maya's part-time job at her aunt's restaurant, the ridiculousness of having to read Hamlet AGAIN for English class. Normal teenage conversation that made Sophia feel slightly more normal.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Heard about assembly Wednesday**

**E: We're both getting awards**

**S: Yeah. Your parents will be there?**

**E: Probably**

**E: Is that weird?**

**S: Little bit**

**E: They need to see you're not what they think**

**S: What if that makes it worse?**

**E: It won't**

**E: Trust me**

But Sophia wasn't sure she did trust that. Because excellence could be threatening. Achievement could make her more, not less, of a complication.

---

Wednesday morning arrived with the particular energy of an all-school assembly—everyone grateful for missing first period but also bored in advance at sitting through an hour of names being called.

Sophia sat with Maya and Sarah in the packed auditorium. The stage was set up with a podium, chairs for award recipients, and a screen showing the St. Paul's logo.

Principal Chen—no relation, but Sophia got jokes about it constantly—took the podium to talk about the importance of academic excellence and balanced achievement.

Sophia tuned it out, scanning the audience. She spotted Ethan's parents three rows from the front: his dad in a suit like he'd come from work, his mom in business casual, both looking intensely focused.

Her own parents were in the back—they'd come despite her telling them it wasn't a big deal. Her dad waved when he saw her looking. She waved back, embarrassed.

"Now I'll begin calling our award recipients to the stage," Principal Chen announced.

Names started being called. Students filed up, shook hands, received certificates or small plaques. Polite applause after each name.

"Sophia Chen, for excellence in AP Physics and AP Calculus, and for maintaining Honor Roll status."

Sophia stood, smoothed her skirt, walked to the stage. Principal Chen shook her hand and gave her two certificates.

"Remarkable achievement, Ms. Chen. We're proud to have you at St. Paul's."

"Thank you."

She took her seat on stage. From there, she could see the entire auditorium. Could see Maya and Sarah clapping enthusiastically. Could see her parents beaming. Could see Ethan's parents whispering to each other.

More names. More awards. Tyler got recognized for history excellence, which surprised everyone including Tyler.

Then: "Ethan Price, for Mathematics Achievement Award, Honor Roll status, and Scholar-Athlete Recognition."

Ethan walked up, shook hands, received his certificates. He was in dress pants and a button-down—she'd never seen him in anything but jeans or hockey gear. He looked older, more serious.

He took the seat three down from hers on stage.

Their eyes met. He smiled, small and private.

Principal Chen was still talking. "Our Scholar-Athlete Recognition is particularly special this year. We have multiple students who have excelled both academically and in athletic pursuits. These students embody our school's values of balanced excellence."

More names. Jordan got called for art achievement. A girl from the volleyball team got recognized for science and sports. Then—

"I'd like to particularly note two students whose achievements this semester have been exceptional. Ethan Price, whose hockey performance has attracted Division 1 college attention while maintaining a 3.9 GPA. And Sophia Chen, who qualified for national badminton competition while achieving perfect scores in two AP science courses."

Applause. Sophia's face felt hot.

"These students represent what's possible when passion meets discipline. They inspire their peers and represent our school's highest values."

From her seat on stage, Sophia could see Ethan's parents. His mother was smiling, applauding. His father's expression was harder to read—not disapproving exactly, but thoughtful. Calculating.

The assembly continued. More awards, some closing remarks about maintaining excellence. Finally, they were dismissed to second period.

Sophia filed off stage with the other award recipients. Her parents found her immediately.

"So proud of you," her mom said, hugging her.

"It's just certificates, Mom."

"It's recognition of hard work." Her dad took a picture of her holding the certificates. "Your grandmother will want to see."

Ethan was talking to his parents a few feet away. Sophia tried not to obviously watch, but she saw his father's hand on his shoulder, his mother saying something that made Ethan nod seriously.

Then his mother looked over and saw Sophia. Said something to his dad. They both looked at her.

His mother smiled and waved.

His father just looked.

Then they were leaving, and Ethan was walking over to her and her parents.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey."

"These are your parents?"

"Yeah. Mom, Dad, this is Ethan. Ethan, these are my parents."

Her dad shook Ethan's hand with the firm enthusiasm of dads everywhere. "We've heard a lot about you. You're the hockey player?"

"Yes, sir. And Sophia's study partner."

"She says you're very good at hockey."

"I try to be."

"He's being modest," Sophia's mom said. "We read about the scout interest. That's very impressive."

Ethan looked genuinely flustered. "Thank you. Your daughter is pretty impressive herself. National badminton qualification is a big deal."

"We're very proud." Her mom looked between them with an expression Sophia couldn't read. "You two should celebrate. Young people should celebrate their achievements."

"Mom—"

"I'm just saying. You work very hard. Take time to enjoy success."

Ethan's parents approached before Sophia could die of embarrassment.

"Ethan," his mother said. "We should get going. You have practice this afternoon."

"Right. Yeah." He looked at Sophia's parents. "It was nice meeting you."

"You too, young man," her dad said.

Then the moment Sophia had been dreading: both sets of parents in the same space.

"Robert and Caroline Price," Ethan's father said, extending his hand to her dad. "Ethan's parents."

"Wei and Lin Chen. Sophia's parents."

They shook hands. The mothers smiled politely. There was a moment of social calculation where everyone tried to figure out if they should have an actual conversation or just exchange pleasantries and leave.

"Your daughter is very accomplished," Caroline Price said finally. "Ethan speaks highly of her academic abilities."

"He's been a good influence," Sophia's mom replied. "She enjoys their study sessions."

"Ethan could use more academically-minded friends," Robert Price said. "Sometimes hockey culture can be... less focused on education."

"Sophia needs friends who understand competitive sports," her dad countered. "Not everyone appreciates that kind of discipline."

They were talking about her and Ethan like they weren't standing right there.

"We should go," Caroline said, touching her husband's arm. "Practice starts at three."

"Right." Robert looked at Sophia directly for the first time. "Congratulations on your badminton achievement. National qualification is impressive."

"Thank you, Mr. Price."

He nodded, then steered his family away.

When they were gone, Sophia's mom said, "They seem... intense."

"That's the polite word for it," Sophia muttered.

"He's under a lot of pressure, isn't he? That boy."

"Yes."

Her mom looked at her with an expression that was too knowing. "Be careful with that, sweetie."

"We're just friends, Mom."

"I know." But her tone said she didn't quite believe it. "Just be careful."

Her parents left, and Sophia stood in the emptying auditorium feeling like she'd just survived some kind of test she didn't know she was taking.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Well that was awkward**

**S: Which part? The assembly or our parents meeting?**

**E: Yes**

**S: Your dad called my achievement "impressive"**

**S: Is that good?**

**E: Coming from him? That's basically glowing praise**

**E: He never calls anything impressive**

**S: Your mom seemed nice**

**E: She is. She's softer than my dad about most things**

**E: But they're a united front when it matters**

**S: And I matter?**

There was a long pause before his response.

**E: You matter a lot**

**E: That's the problem**

Sophia didn't know how to respond to that, so she didn't. Just went to her second period class and tried to focus on English literature and not the fact that Ethan's parents had now seen her as a peer-level achiever and she had no idea if that made things better or worse.

---

That weekend, there was a party at Jordan's house. His parents were out of town for some art convention, and Jordan had convinced them he was mature enough to be trusted alone for the weekend.

"I am extremely mature," Jordan said on Thursday at lunch, planning the party. "I will be the most responsible host."

"You're going to trash your house," Tyler predicted.

"I'm going to tastefully celebrate Halloween with a few close friends."

"It's Halloween?"

"Saturday. Keep up, Tyler."

"I thought Halloween was for kids."

"Halloween is for everyone who enjoys festive gatherings and creative costumes."

"You just want an excuse to throw a party."

"Also true."

Sophia wasn't planning to go. She had homework and was still recovering from the tournament and social situations made her anxious at the best of times.

But Friday afternoon, Maya cornered her at her locker.

"You're going to Jordan's party."

"I wasn't planning on it."

"Too bad. You're going."

"Maya—"

"Sophia. You spend every weekend studying or training or overthinking your entire existence. You're going to one party. You're going to wear a costume. You're going to have fun."

"I don't have a costume."

"We're going shopping. Now. Come on."

Forty minutes later, they were at Value Village looking at the picked-over Halloween section.

"Everything's already been taken," Sophia said.

"Then we get creative." Maya held up a white lab coat. "You're a scientist. You could literally wear this with your normal clothes and call it a costume."

"That's not creative. That's lazy."

"You're right. You need something better." Maya rifled through the racks. "What about Marie Curie? Lab coat, vintage dress, carry around a beaker labeled 'Radium.'"

"That's... actually kind of funny."

"I'm a genius. A genius who's going to be a cat because I'm also lazy."

They bought the lab coat and found a vintage-looking dress at Goodwill. Maya made her buy red lipstick "for authenticity" even though Sophia never wore lipstick.

Saturday afternoon, Sophia was getting ready when her phone buzzed.

**E: Are you going to Jordan's tonight?**

**S: Maya's making me**

**E: Good. I'll see you there?**

**S: What are you going as?**

**E: It's a surprise**

**S: That's ominous**

**E: Or mysterious. There's a difference.**

Maya picked her up at seven. They arrived at Jordan's house at 7:30, and it was already packed. Music loud, people everywhere, someone had set up colored lights that made everything feel like a club.

Jordan answered the door dressed as Bob Ross—complete with wig and fake beard and a palette of paint.

"You look ridiculous," Maya said.

"I look iconic. There's a difference." He saw Sophia's costume and grinned. "Marie Curie?"

"How did you know?"

"The beaker labeled 'Radium' is a clue. Very science-nerd of you."

"Thanks?"

"It's a compliment. Come in. Food's in the kitchen, drinks are... also in the kitchen. Everything's in the kitchen."

They pushed through the crowd. Sophia recognized people from school, some she knew, most she didn't. Maya immediately found Sarah, who was dressed as a pirate.

"Your costume coordination is questionable," Sophia observed.

"We're eclectic," Sarah said. "It's artistic."

Sophia got a soda and leaned against the kitchen counter, watching people. This wasn't really her scene—the noise, the crowd, the performative social interaction. But Maya had been right that she needed to do normal teenage things sometimes.

"Nice costume," Tyler said, appearing next to her. He was wearing a hockey jersey and had drawn stitches on his face. "Hockey player who got in a fight?"

"Creative."

"I'm committed to the bit." He grabbed chips. "You seen Ethan yet?"

"No. Why?"

"You'll see." He grinned and walked away before she could ask what that meant.

Sophia circulated, talked to a few people from her physics class, avoided the living room where people were dancing because absolutely not. She was considering texting Maya that she'd done her social duty and wanted to leave when she heard someone say—

"Is that Ethan Price dressed as Einstein?"

Sophia turned.

And there he was.

Wild white wig, mustache drawn on, wearing a wrinkled shirt and vest, holding a chalkboard with "E=mc²" written on it.

Their eyes met across the room.

He was dressed as Einstein. She was dressed as Marie Curie. They were accidentally matching costumes.

Jordan appeared at her shoulder. "Oh, this is perfect."

"We didn't plan this," Sophia said quickly.

"Sure you didn't."

"Jordan, we literally didn't—"

"The universe is shipping you. Embrace it."

Ethan made his way through the crowd toward her. "Hey."

"Hey."

"You're Marie Curie."

"You're Einstein."

"We're... science costume twins."

"Apparently."

They stared at each other. Someone took a picture. Maya was openly laughing from across the room.

"This is either really funny or really embarrassing," Ethan said.

"Both. Definitely both."

"Want to lean into it?"

"What does that mean?"

He held up his chalkboard. "We could take photos. Commit to the bit."

"You sound like Tyler."

"Tyler has some good ideas occasionally."

Sophia laughed. "Okay. Fine. We're science costume twins. Let's own it."

They ended up taking ridiculous photos—holding their props, making serious "scientist" faces, recreating the "Back to the Future" poster pose that Jordan insisted was thematically appropriate even though neither of them were dressed as Doc Brown.

"You two are adorable," Maya said, taking approximately fifty photos.

"We're not adorable. We're historically accurate," Sophia protested.

"Historically accurate adorableness."

"That's not a thing."

"It is now. I'm making it a thing."

The party continued around them. Music, people, the normal chaos of teenagers in a house without parents. Sophia found herself relaxing, laughing at Jordan's stories about art class disasters and Tyler's explanation of why hockey fights were "technically athletic performance art."

But she was always aware of where Ethan was. Like her brain had dedicated processing power to tracking his location. He'd be talking to someone across the room, and she'd know exactly where he stood. He'd laugh at something Jordan said, and she'd hear it over the music.

Around nine, she needed air. The house was too warm, too many people. She slipped out to Jordan's back deck.

The air was cold, sharp in her lungs. Halloween night in Winnipeg, winter coming. The sky was clear, stars visible despite the city lights.

The door opened behind her.

"You okay?" Ethan asked.

"Yeah. Just needed quiet."

He joined her at the deck railing. "Too much party?"

"Little bit."

They stood there in silence, their breath visible in the cold air. Sophia was very aware of how close he was standing. How his Einstein wig had gotten slightly askew. How she could see the marker mustache up close and it was somehow both ridiculous and endearing.

"We really didn't plan the costumes," she said.

"I know."

"But everyone thinks we did."

"Does it matter what everyone thinks?"

"Doesn't it? Your parents, the team, everyone watching to see if you're distracted..."

"Sophie." He turned to face her. "I'm tired of caring what everyone thinks."

"You have to care. Your recruitment—"

"I played well with the scout watching. I got good grades. I'm doing everything right. And I'm still not allowed to just..." He gestured between them. "This."

"This?"

"Whatever this is. Whatever we are. I'm so tired of pretending it's nothing."

Sophia's heart was doing complicated things. "Ethan—"

"I know. I know all the reasons we're being careful. But standing here in matching science costumes on Halloween, I really don't care about any of them."

"We can't—"

"I know we can't. But I want to."

He was looking at her the way he had at Assiniboine Park. Like she was the only thing in focus, everything else blurred background.

"Jordan has an art studio," Ethan said quietly. "Upstairs. It's quieter up there."

"We shouldn't—"

"Probably not."

"People will notice—"

"Maybe."

But Sophia found herself nodding. "Okay."

They slipped back inside, navigated through the party. No one seemed to notice them heading upstairs—everyone was too busy with their own conversations and drama.

Jordan's art studio was at the end of the upstairs hallway. A converted bedroom full of easels and canvases and the smell of paint. The music from downstairs was muted here, distant.

Ethan closed the door.

They were alone.

Sophia's brain immediately started calculating risk factors, probability of discovery, potential consequences. But her heart—her heart was saying something different.

"We can just talk," Ethan said. "That's all this has to be."

"Okay."

But neither of them moved toward the chairs or the couch. They stood in the middle of the room, Einstein and Marie Curie, two people dressed as brilliant scientists who probably understood matter and energy better than they understood whatever force was operating between them right now.

"I meant what I said," Ethan continued. "About being tired of pretending."

"I know."

"Do you feel the same?"

"Yes," Sophia whispered. "But that doesn't change anything. Your parents, your recruitment, everything you've worked for—"

"What about what I want?"

"What do you want?"

"You," he said simply. "I want you. I want to not have to calculate every interaction and maintain careful distance and pretend I don't think about you constantly."

Sophia couldn't breathe. "Ethan—"

"I want to kiss you, Sophie. I've wanted to kiss you since The Forks. Since before The Forks. Since you moved back and showed up in my physics class and made everything complicated and better simultaneously."

"We can't."

"Why not?"

"Because—" She had reasons. Good reasons. Important reasons. But standing there looking at him, she couldn't remember a single one.

"Because," she tried again, "your parents will find out eventually. The team will know. It'll be more complicated."

"Everything's already complicated. Might as well be complicated and honest."

He took a step closer. Then another. Until they were inches apart, close enough that she could see the marker from his fake mustache had smudged slightly, could count the gold flecks in his eyes.

"Tell me to stop," he said quietly.

Sophia didn't tell him to stop.

She closed the remaining distance and kissed him.

Later, she'd remember the moment in precise detail. How his hand came up to cup her face, how her fingers tangled in that ridiculous Einstein wig, how he tasted like the soda he'd been drinking and something underneath that was just him.

How it felt like everything clicking into place.

How it felt like the phase transition she'd been describing in physics—the moment when everything changes state, when water becomes ice or ice becomes water, the structure fundamentally different but still essentially the same atoms.

How it felt like coming home.

They broke apart, both breathing hard.

"We just kissed," Sophia said.

"We really did."

"This is going to make everything more complicated."

"I know."

"Your parents—"

"I know."

"Everyone will—"

"Sophia." He rested his forehead against hers. "Can we just have this moment? Before we figure out all the complications?"

She nodded. And kissed him again.

This time it was slower, softer. His hands in her hair, her hands on his shoulders. Taking their time because they could, because they were alone, because this was theirs and no one could tell them it was wrong.

When they separated again, Ethan was smiling. "So that happened."

"That definitely happened."

"Regrets?"

"Ask me when your parents find out."

"They're going to find out eventually."

"I know."

"Are you okay with that?"

Sophia thought about it. About consequences and complications and everything that was about to get harder. About Ethan's recruitment and his parents' expectations and the fact that being together would make both their lives more difficult.

But she also thought about the way he looked at her. The way he'd shown up to her tournament with flowers. The way he explained physics like it was beautiful and looked at hockey like it was art and made her remember that achieving things could be joyful, not just necessary.

"Yeah," she said. "I'm okay with it."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

He kissed her again, and Sophia let herself stop calculating. Just for a few minutes. Just for this moment.

They were still standing there, wrapped up in each other, when footsteps sounded in the hallway.

Then Jordan's voice, urgent: "Ethan! Your dad's here!"

They froze.

"He's looking for you," Jordan continued, voice closer now. "His car's in the driveway."

Ethan pulled out his phone. Seven missed calls. Three voicemails. Multiple texts, each more urgent.

"Shit," he muttered.

"You have to go down," Sophia said.

"Come with me."

"That'll make it worse. He can't see us together right now. Not like this."

Footsteps on the stairs. Multiple people coming up.

Jordan appeared at the door. "He's coming up here. He saw someone say you went upstairs."

Sophia's panic spiked. "Where do I—"

"Behind the easel," Jordan pointed. "Quick."

She dove behind the large easel in the corner just as heavier footsteps reached the top of the stairs.

Then Ethan's father's voice: "Ethan? Jordan said you're up here?"

Ethan moved toward the door, putting himself between his father and the rest of the room. "Dad? What are you doing here?"

Robert Price appeared in the doorway, still in his coat, expression thunderous.

"We need to go. Now. Coach Morrison called. There's been a situation."

"What situation?"

"Your spot on the AAA roster. They're reconsidering."

From behind the easel, Sophia could see a slice of the room. Ethan's shock, his father's barely controlled anger.

"What? Why?"

"We'll discuss it at home. Get your things."

Robert's eyes scanned the room, landing on the two cups of cider on the table. One Ethan's, one Sophia's, sitting there like evidence.

"Are you alone up here?" he asked.

Ethan hesitated. Just for a second, but Sophia saw it. The choice: tell the truth and face the consequences, or lie and protect her.

"Ethan," his father said, voice hard. "I asked you a question."

And time stopped.
