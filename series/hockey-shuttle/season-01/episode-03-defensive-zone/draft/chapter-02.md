# CHAPTER 2: Rules of Engagement

The following Monday, Sophia arrived at school to find a new rhythm had established itself without anyone officially announcing it.

She and Ethan were "academic collaboration partners." That was the phrase Jordan used sarcastically when he found them working through calc problems in the library before first period.

"Very academically collaborative," Jordan observed, watching them debate the proper way to find the derivative of a composite function. "Much learning. Such education."

"Do you need something?" Ethan asked without looking up from his textbook.

"Just appreciating the collaborative energy. The scholarly vibes. The extremely platonic mathematics."

"Jordan," Sophia said sweetly, "don't you have an art project due?"

"Deflection. Classic academic collaborator move."

"I will throw this calculator at your head."

"Violent academic collaboration. Even better."

Tyler appeared behind Jordan, dropping his backpack on the table with a thud. "Leave them alone. They're being painfully obvious but at least they're subtle about being painfully obvious."

"That sentence doesn't make sense," Sophia said.

"Your face doesn't make sense."

"We're seventeen, not twelve."

"You're never too old for 'your face' jokes." Tyler pulled out his own calc textbook. "Actually though, can someone explain integration to me? Because I'm pretty sure I've been doing it wrong for three weeks."

"You've definitely been doing it wrong for three weeks," Ethan confirmed, looking at Tyler's homework. "You forgot the constant of integration on every single problem."

"The what?"

"The plus C," Sophia explained. "When you integrate, you add an arbitrary constant because you're essentially reversing differentiation, and constants disappear when you differentiate."

Tyler stared at her. "I understood maybe 40% of those words."

"Here." She pulled his notebook over and started showing him the correct method. Behind her textbook, where Jordan and Tyler couldn't see, her phone lit up with a text from Ethan.

**E: You're very patient with Tyler**

**E: I would have given up after explaining once**

**S: He's trying. That counts for something**

**E: You're good at teaching**

**S: Years of explaining badminton strategy to Maya**

**S: She has zero hand-eye coordination but wanted to understand the game**

**E: Maya plays badminton?**

**S: God no. She watches and yells encouragement**

**S: Mostly she yells "HIT THE THING" which is technically accurate**

Sophia watched Ethan's shoulders shake with silent laughter across the table.

"Are you texting each other right now?" Jordan asked. "While sitting at the same table?"

"No," they said simultaneously.

"You're both terrible liars."

"Focus on your art project, Jordan."

"I finished my art project."

"Then go be artistic somewhere else."

"Rude. I'm wounded. Artistically wounded."

But he was smiling as he said it, and Sophia knew that underneath the teasing, Jordan was being protective. Making sure they were okay. Making sure this new dynamic—whatever it was—worked.

The warning bell rang. They packed up books, headed to separate classes. Sophia felt Ethan watching her walk away and deliberately didn't look back.

This was the new normal. Present but distant. Together but separate. Like they were running parallel code that occasionally intersected at designated points.

Physics class felt like an exercise in calculated awareness. Mr. Reimer was lecturing about rotational motion—angular velocity, torque, moment of inertia. Sophia took notes and understood the material and was also hyper-conscious of Ethan three rows back.

Her phone buzzed silently in her pocket.

**E: Rotational motion is basically fancy spinning, right?**

She glanced at the board. They were working through a problem about a figure skater pulling in her arms to increase rotation speed.

**S: Conservation of angular momentum**

**S: Moment of inertia decreases, angular velocity increases to compensate**

**E: So she spins faster when she's more compact**

**S: Exactly**

**E: That's actually beautiful**

**E: Physics is weirdly beautiful when you explain it**

Sophia had to actively stop herself from smiling at her desk.

After class, Tyler caught up to her in the hallway. "Hey, question."

"What's up?"

"Is Ethan okay? Like actually okay?"

Sophia chose her words carefully. "Why do you ask?"

"He's been weird at practice. Not bad weird—he's playing fine, maybe better than usual. But he's in his head about stuff. Coach Morrison pulled him aside Friday to ask what's going on."

"What did Ethan say?"

"That everything's fine. But everything's clearly not fine because his parents showed up to practice last week. Just stood there watching. His dad was taking notes."

Sophia's stomach dropped. "Notes about what?"

"No idea. But it freaked Ethan out." Tyler shifted his backpack. "Look, I know something's going on with you two. Everyone knows. And I don't care about the drama or whatever. I just care that he's okay. We need him focused for playoffs."

There it was. The subtext she'd been expecting since this whole thing started. *We need him focused for hockey. Don't mess with his focus.*

"He's fine," Sophia said. "We're just friends."

"Sure. Friends who stare at each other like physics has suddenly become intensely fascinating."

"Physics IS fascinating."

"Yeah, okay, nerd." But Tyler said it fondly. "Just... I don't know. His parents are intense. Everyone on the team knows it. They've got his whole life mapped out. If you actually care about him, be careful with that."

He walked away before Sophia could respond.

She found Maya at lunch, slid into the seat across from her in the cafeteria. "Everyone's got opinions about me and Ethan."

"Welcome to high school, where everyone has opinions about everything." Maya bit into her sandwich. "What's the latest opinion?"

"Tyler wants to make sure I'm not 'messing with Ethan's focus.'"

"Of course he does. Hockey bros before actual human emotions."

"That's not fair. Tyler's being protective."

"Tyler's being a hockey bro. There's a difference." Maya pointed her sandwich at Sophia. "But also, how ARE things with you and Ethan? You've been doing this weird dance all week."

"We're being careful. His parents are watching everything."

"That's seriously messed up."

"They're invested in his success."

"They're controlling. Those are different things."

Sophia picked at her own lunch. "I know. But it's his life. His choice how to handle them."

"Is it though? If they're threatening to pull college funding?"

"Maya—"

"I'm just saying. You're bending over backward to prove you're not a distraction, but maybe the problem isn't you. Maybe it's parents who think their son is an investment instead of a person."

Sophia didn't have a response to that.

Ethan appeared at their table with Jordan and Tyler. The cafeteria dynamic shifted—guys on one end, girls on the other, everyone pretending this was totally normal and not a careful orchestration of public distance.

"Anyone doing anything this weekend?" Jordan asked.

"Provincial badminton qualifiers," Sophia said. "All weekend tournament."

"Oh, that's the big one, right?" Tyler asked. "The one you need to place in to make nationals?"

"Yeah. Top eight in singles advance."

"You'll crush it," Maya said confidently. "You've been training like a demon."

"Coach thinks I have a shot at top four."

"Coach is right," Ethan said. Everyone looked at him. "What? I've watched her practice. She's really good."

"When did you watch her practice?" Jordan asked innocently.

"I've... walked by the gym. The windows exist."

"Uh-huh. Casual window-walking. Very subtle."

"I hate you."

"You love me."

Tyler's phone buzzed. He checked it and groaned. "Coach wants extra practice Wednesday night. Something about our defensive zone coverage being sloppy."

"Wednesday?" Ethan frowned. "That's bad timing."

"Why?"

"I have..." He trailed off, glancing at Sophia. "Nothing. Wednesday's fine."

But Sophia knew what he'd been about to say. They had a calc test Wednesday morning and had planned to study Tuesday night. Had planned it via text, carefully, making sure it counted as academic collaboration and not a date.

"We can study a different night," she said quietly.

"You two are the worst at subtle," Jordan observed.

"We're not being subtle. We're being obvious about being academic collaboration partners."

"Is that what we're calling it?"

"That's what everyone's calling it," Tyler said. "Also what Coach Morrison called it when he asked Ethan if his 'study partner' was impacting his performance."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "What did you tell him?"

"That your performance is fine. Better than fine. You've been playing lights out lately." Tyler shrugged. "But he's asking questions. So are the scouts. There's one coming to Friday's game."

"Friday?" Sophia asked before she could stop herself.

"Yeah. Junior scout from Boston College. Apparently they're interested in Ethan and wanted to see a game in person."

The table went quiet.

"That's huge," Jordan said finally. "Boston College is Division 1."

"It's preliminary," Ethan said. "They scout lots of players."

"Still. That's serious interest."

"I know."

He didn't look at Sophia, but she felt the weight of what he wasn't saying. This was important. Exactly the kind of opportunity his parents had invested everything to create. The kind of thing that justified their pressure and control and ultimatums.

The kind of thing she absolutely couldn't interfere with.

"You'll be great," she said. Careful. Supportive. The exact level of friendly that academic collaboration partners would use.

"Thanks."

The conversation moved on to other things, but Sophia barely heard it. Her brain was already running calculations. Friday game with a scout. Wednesday practice instead of studying. His parents watching everything. Her tournament this weekend.

They were both hitting critical moments in their respective sports, and the universe had decided to schedule them simultaneously.

Of course it had.

---

Wednesday night, Sophia was alone in her room working through calc problems when her phone buzzed.

**E: Practice just ended**

**E: We ran defensive drills for 90 minutes**

**E: I think Coach is trying to kill us**

**S: Defensive zone coverage?**

**E: How did you know?**

**S: Tyler mentioned it at lunch Monday**

**E: Right. Yeah. Apparently our formation was collapsing too easily**

**E: Which is true but also ow my legs**

**S: Ice bath?**

**E: Already did. Now just contemplating the nature of suffering**

**S: Very philosophical**

**E: I contain multitudes**

**S: That's a Walt Whitman reference**

**E: Look at you knowing poetry**

**S: I contain multitudes too**

There was a pause, then:

**E: I wish we were studying together tonight**

**E: The calc problems are kicking my ass and you explain them better than the textbook**

**S: Which problems?**

**E: Related rates. I don't understand what they're asking**

**S: Send me a picture**

A minute later, a photo of his textbook appeared. Problem 23, something about a ladder sliding down a wall. Classic related rates.

Sophia could just text him the answer. Or she could...

She hit the video call button.

Ethan answered after two rings. He was in his room, hair wet from the post-practice shower, wearing a Saints hockey t-shirt. His desk was visible behind him, covered in textbooks and paper.

"Hey," he said, smiling.

"Hey. So, related rates."

"Are we really going to study via video call?"

"You need help. I'm helping. This is academic collaboration."

"Very collaborative."

"Shut up and show me the problem."

He angled his phone so she could see his textbook. "Okay, so there's a ladder sliding down a wall—"

"Twenty feet long," Sophia read. "Bottom sliding away at two feet per second. How fast is the top sliding down when the bottom is sixteen feet from the wall?"

"I don't even know where to start."

"Okay. First, draw it out. Visualize the triangle—wall, ground, ladder."

She watched him sketch on paper, his hand moving confidently even though his math was uncertain. Athlete's hands, she thought. Precise motor control even when the brain was still figuring it out.

"Got it," he said. "Triangle."

"Now, what relationship exists between the sides?"

"Pythagorean theorem? Because it's a right triangle?"

"Exactly. So write that out."

He did: x² + y² = 20²

"Good. Now, what are we trying to find?"

"How fast the top is sliding... so the rate of change of y?"

"Right. dy/dt. But we know dx/dt—the bottom is sliding at two feet per second. So we need to relate these rates."

"Which means..."

"Differentiate with respect to time."

She watched understanding dawn on his face. "Oh. So I take the derivative of both sides?"

"Yes! Do it."

He worked through it, mumbling to himself. "2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0..."

"Keep going."

"And we know x is sixteen, dx/dt is two, and we can find y using Pythagorean theorem..." He calculated. "y is twelve. So 2(16)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0..."

"Solve for dy/dt."

His pencil moved. "64 + 24(dy/dt) = 0... dy/dt = -64/24... approximately -2.67 feet per second?"

"Perfect. The negative means it's moving down, which makes sense."

"I actually understood that."

"You did! See, you don't need me. You just need to visualize it first."

"No, I definitely need you." He was looking at her through the screen in a way that made her acutely aware that she was in her pajamas with her hair in a messy bun. "You make it make sense. The textbook just throws equations at me."

"The textbook assumes you can visualize abstract mathematical relationships without context."

"I'm a hockey player. I need context. Physical examples."

"Then we'll use hockey examples." Sophia grabbed her own textbook. "Next problem—anything about rates of change, think about puck velocity. Anything about angles, think about shot trajectories."

They worked through five more problems, Ethan getting faster and more confident with each one. Sophia found herself relaxing into the familiar rhythm of explaining concepts, watching understanding click into place.

"You really should be a teacher," Ethan said after they finished the last problem.

"I'm going to be a physicist."

"You can be both. Lots of physicists teach."

"Maybe." She'd never thought about it much. Her plan had always been research—pure science, discovering new things about how the universe worked.

"You're good at it," Ethan said. "Making complicated things feel simple."

"Things are simple if you break them down enough."

"Is that true for everything? Or just math?"

"I think..." Sophia considered. "I think most things follow patterns. You just have to find the right framework to see them."

"What about feelings?"

"What?"

"Do feelings follow patterns? Can you framework those?"

She looked at him through the screen. He was asking but also not asking, the question carrying layers.

"I don't know," she said honestly. "I keep trying to. But they're more like quantum mechanics than classical physics."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning the act of observing changes the system. You can't measure both position and momentum precisely. Uncertainty principle."

Ethan smiled. "So you're saying feelings are subject to Heisenberg uncertainty?"

"I'm saying feelings don't optimize neatly."

"Good to know we're both confused then."

"Mutually confused academic collaboration partners."

"The most confused."

They looked at each other through their screens. Sophia's room behind her, his room behind him. Miles apart but connected by this ridiculous video call that had started as calc help and become something else.

"I should let you sleep," Sophia said. "You have practice tomorrow."

"And you have your tournament this weekend."

"Yeah."

"You're going to be incredible. You know that, right?"

"I'm going to try to be incredible."

"You don't have to try. You just are."

Her heart did the ridiculous thing again.

"Goodnight, Ethan."

"Night, Soph."

She ended the call and sat there staring at her blank phone screen. They'd just spent ninety minutes doing calculus via video chat, and somehow it felt more intimate than sitting next to each other at school had all week.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Thanks for the help**

**E: I actually feel ready for the test now**

**S: You were ready. You just needed to visualize it**

**E: I needed YOU**

**E: To help me visualize it**

**E: The math thing**

**E: I'm going to stop talking now**

Sophia laughed out loud.

**S: Goodnight, Ethan**

**E: Goodnight for real this time**

She plugged in her phone and got into bed. Tomorrow was Thursday. Then Friday with his scout game. Then her tournament all weekend. They'd barely see each other, which was probably good. Maintained distance. Proved focus.

So why did it feel terrible?

---

Thursday's calc test went well. Sophia finished with twenty minutes to spare and spent them doodling force diagrams again. When she glanced back, Ethan was still working, but he looked confident. Not stressed.

After class, he caught up to her. "I think I actually aced that."

"Of course you did."

"Because you explained it."

"Because you understood it. I just helped you see what you already knew."

Tyler appeared between them. "You two are disgustingly wholesome. Can you be normal teenagers and make bad decisions?"

"We're studying," Sophia said. "That's a good decision."

"Exactly. Disgusting." But he was grinning. "Ethan, you coming to lunch? Coach wants to talk to the team about tomorrow's game."

"Yeah, one sec." Tyler walked ahead, and Ethan lowered his voice. "Good luck this weekend. Text me how you're doing?"

"You'll be at your game."

"Before and after. I want to know."

"Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there for a moment too long, then separated. Sophia went to find Maya, who was at their usual lunch table looking amused.

"You two are painful to watch," Maya said.

"We're being appropriate."

"You're being constrained. It's different."

"His parents are watching everything. There's a scout at his game tomorrow. I can't be a distraction."

"You're not a distraction. You're a person he cares about. Those are different things."

"Not to his parents."

Maya sighed. "When's your first match?"

"Saturday morning, eight AM."

"Gross. Who schedules sports at eight AM?"

"Tournament organizers who hate joy."

"I'll be there. Sarah too. We'll bring signs."

"Please don't bring signs."

"We're definitely bringing signs."

"Maya—"

"I'm thinking 'CHEN DESTRUCTION' in big letters. Maybe some glitter."

"I will disown you as a friend."

"You can't disown me. I know too many of your secrets."

"I don't have secrets."

"You have an entire secret pining situation happening with Ethan Price."

"It's not pining. It's mutual acknowledgment of feelings that we're not acting on due to external pressures."

Maya stared at her. "That's literally the definition of pining."

"It's strategic delay."

"PINING."

Sophia threw a carrot at her.

Friday arrived with the weight of importance. Ethan had his scout game. The whole school knew—there were posters in the hallway advertising it, the hockey team wore their jerseys, there was an energy in the building like something significant was happening.

Sophia deliberately didn't go to the game.

She'd thought about it. Imagined sitting in the stands with Maya and Sarah, watching him play. But Tyler's words kept echoing: *We need him focused.*

So instead, she went home after school and did homework and tried not to check her phone every thirty seconds.

The game started at seven. By 7:15, she gave up pretending she wasn't going to track the score online.

Saints were up 1-0 after the first period. Ethan had the assist.

By the end of the second period, it was tied 2-2. Ethan had scored one of the goals.

Sophia's phone buzzed at 8:47.

**Maya: why aren't you here**

**S: Giving him space**

**Maya: that's dumb**

**Maya: he keeps looking at the stands**

**Maya: like he's looking for someone**

**S: Don't**

**Maya: I'm just saying**

**Maya: He's playing well but he looks sad**

Sophia stared at that message. *He looks sad.*

Her phone buzzed again, but this time it was her badminton group chat. Coach Yun sending final instructions for tomorrow. Reminding them about warm-up time, what to bring, the importance of mental preparation.

Right. Her tournament. The thing she'd trained months for. The qualification for nationals.

She couldn't be at Ethan's game because she needed to focus too.

That's what she told herself.

The final score came in at 9:23: Saints 4, Raiders 3.

Ethan had two goals and one assist. Three points in a game with a Division 1 scout watching.

Her phone buzzed at 9:45.

**E: We won**

**S: I saw! Three points!!**

**E: Scout wants to meet with me and my parents next week**

**E: This is huge**

**S: It's amazing. You were incredible**

**E: I wished you'd been there**

**E: But I understand why you weren't**

**S: You needed to focus**

**E: I know**

**E: Still wished it though**

Sophia typed and deleted four responses before settling on:

**S: Me too**

**S: But this is what matters. The scout. The opportunity. Your future.**

**S: I'm so proud of you**

**E: Thanks, Soph**

**E: Good luck tomorrow. Destroy everyone.**

**S: That's the plan**

**S: Get some rest. You earned it**

**E: You too**

**E: Goodnight**

**S: Night**

She set her phone on her nightstand and lay in the dark thinking about him looking at the stands. Looking for someone who wasn't there. Looking for her.

Her mom had said be careful with serious people's children.

But what if they were both serious people's children? What if they were both being optimized and engineered and pushed toward predetermined futures? What if the thing they needed most was someone who understood that pressure?

Sophia closed her eyes.

Tomorrow, she'd play in the biggest badminton tournament of her life. She'd prove she was excellent independently. Show that she wasn't just "the girl Ethan likes" but an athlete with her own achievements.

And maybe, if she placed well enough, his parents would start to see her differently.

Not as a distraction.

As a peer.

---

Saturday morning arrived dark and cold, October in Winnipeg showing its teeth. Sophia was up at six, eating breakfast that tasted like cardboard, checking her gear three times.

Her parents drove her to the University of Manitoba PAC Arena. The parking lot was already filling up—badminton clubs from across the province converging for the qualifying tournament.

"You're going to do great," her mom said, pulling into a spot.

"I know."

"That's my daughter. Confidence." Her dad smiled in the rearview mirror. "Make them work for every point."

Inside, the arena had been converted into a badminton facility—eight courts set up with nets, officials' tables, scoreboards. The atmosphere was electric with competitive energy. Players warming up, coaches giving last-minute instructions, the sound of shuttles being hit echoing through the space.

Sophia found Coach Yun and her team. Maya and Sarah were already in the stands, holding a sign that read "CHEN DOMINATION" in glittery letters.

She should have known better than to think Maya was kidding.

"Chen!" Coach called. "You're on Court 3 at 8:15. First match is against Williams from Brandon."

"Yes, Coach."

"You've played her before. She's got a strong smash but weak defense. Make her move."

"Got it."

Sophia warmed up, hitting shuttles with one of her teammates, getting loose. The familiar rhythm calmed her nerves—set up, swing, follow through. Cause and effect. Input and output.

Her first match started at 8:18. Williams was good—powerful serves, aggressive net play. But Coach was right about the defense. Sophia worked the angles, dropped shots just over the net, made her opponent run.

She won 21-15, 21-17.

Second match at 10:30 against Chang from Winnipeg. Tougher competition—longer rallies, better defense. Sophia had to work for every point. The first game went to deuce, finally ending 24-22 in Sophia's favor. The second game was easier, 21-16.

By lunch break, she was 2-0 and in quarterfinals.

Her phone had six messages.

**E: How's it going?**

**E: Saw you're 2-0. Obviously.**

**E: I'm watching the bracket online**

**E: Is that creepy?**

**E: Probably creepy**

**E: But I'm invested now so I'm watching anyway**

Sophia smiled at her phone.

**S: Not creepy. Sweet.**

**S: Quarterfinals at 1:30**

**E: You've got this**

**E: Make them regret showing up**

**Maya: come get lunch, champion**

Sophia found Maya and Sarah in the concourse area, eating Tim Hortons sandwiches.

"You're destroying people," Maya said approvingly. "It's beautiful."

"I'm winning matches. That's different."

"No, you're destroying people. That last rally? Williams looked like she wanted to cry."

"That's just competitive emotion."

"It was beautiful devastation." Sarah handed Sophia a sandwich. "Eat. Your next match is the hard one."

She was right. Quarterfinals at 1:30 against Lee from Winnipeg—ranked second in the province, nationally competitive, absolutely brutal on court.

The match was a war.

Lee's defense was incredible. Everything Sophia hit came back. Long rallies, both players running, the shuttle barely clearing the net or landing just inside the lines. The first game went to 26-24, Lee winning. The second game went to Sophia, 21-18. The third game was pure competition—every point fought for, neither player giving an inch.

At 20-19, match point for Sophia, she served.

Lee returned deep. Sophia returned cross-court. Lee smashed. Sophia defended, lofting high to the back. Lee moved to smash again—and Sophia saw the opening. As Lee committed to the smash, Sophia moved forward. The shuttle came hard and fast, and she dropped it just over the net. Perfect touch. Lee dove, couldn't reach it.

Point. Game. Match.

The score was 23-21.

Sophia barely remembered the next hour. Semifinal match at 3:45 against Tran from Steinbach. Won 21-17, 21-14. She was in finals.

Finals at 6:00 PM against Manitoba's top seed: Rachel Morrison, who'd won provincials three years running.

Sophia was exhausted. Her legs ached. Her shoulder was sore from a hundred overhead smashes. She'd been playing for almost ten hours with only short breaks.

But she was in finals.

Her phone buzzed during her dinner break.

**E: FINALS!!**

**E: I knew you'd make it**

**E: When does it start?**

**S: 6:00**

**S: I'm tired**

**E: You're amazing**

**E: Go be amazing for forty more minutes**

**E: Then you can collapse**

**S: Sound plan**

The finals match started at 6:07. Morrison was everything Sophia had heard—fast, powerful, strategic. She'd been training at a national level for years. This wasn't a match. It was an education.

Sophia lost the first game 21-12.

Between games, Coach Yun pulled her aside. "She's better than you."

"I know."

"But you're faster. And you're smarter. Stop playing her game. Make her play yours."

"How?"

"Variation. She's expecting power. Give her finesse. Then when she adjusts, hit her with power."

The second game started. Sophia changed strategy. Drop shots, slices, weird angles. Anything to disrupt Morrison's rhythm. It worked—sort of. The game was closer. But Morrison adjusted, and Sophia lost 21-18.

Silver medal. Second in the province. Qualified for nationals.

She should have been happy. She'd achieved her goal. Made nationals. Proven herself.

But standing on the podium getting her silver medal while Morrison got gold, all Sophia could think was: *Second place.*

After the ceremony, Maya hugged her hard. "You were incredible."

"I lost."

"You got second in the entire province. You're going to nationals."

"I lost to Morrison."

"Everyone loses to Morrison. She's basically a robot designed to win at badminton."

Sophia laughed despite herself.

Her phone buzzed.

**E: Silver medal and nationals qualification**

**E: You're amazing**

**S: I came in second**

**E: Out of hundreds of players**

**E: You're ranked 2nd in Manitoba**

**E: That's not losing**

**E: That's being elite**

Something in her chest loosened.

**S: Thanks**

**E: Can I see you tomorrow?**

**E: Celebrate properly?**

**S: Yes**

**S: Please**

**E: I'll pick you up at 1?**

**S: Perfect**

Sophia put her phone away and went to find her parents. Her dad was beaming. Her mom had tears in her eyes.

"Second in the province," her dad said, hugging her. "We're so proud."

"I wanted to win."

"You will. Next time." Her mom squeezed her shoulder. "Rachel Morrison is a graduating senior. Next year, that gold is yours."

Maybe. Or maybe Sophia would always be second. Maybe that's just who she was—excellent but not the best. Good enough to qualify but not to win.

She shook off the thought. Silver medal was still a medal. Nationals was still nationals.

And tomorrow, she'd see Ethan. They'd celebrate. For one afternoon, they could just exist without boundaries or pressure or careful distance.

Tomorrow could be different.

Tomorrow had to be different.

**End of Chapter 2**
