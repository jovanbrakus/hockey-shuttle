# EPISODE 3: "DEFENSIVE ZONE"

## Episode Information
- **Series**: Hockey Shuttle
- **Season**: 1

## Episode Synopsis

**Previously On**: Ethan confessed his feelings at The Forks. Sophia admitted she feels the same. They stood together watching the city lights, everything changed between them. Becca saw them together and walked away.

**This Episode**: The morning after brings consequences. Everyone knows about the breakup. Ethan's parents deliver an ultimatum: focus on hockey or lose their support for college. Sophia and Ethan try to navigate being "something" without labels while external pressure mounts. Her badminton excellence and academic achievements force his parents to see her differently - not just distraction but peer. The episode builds toward Halloween party at Jordan's where everything they've been avoiding comes to a head when his father shows up unexpectedly.

**Cliffhanger**: Jordan's Halloween party, Ethan and Sophia alone in the art studio, finally about to kiss - Jordan calls up: "Ethan! Your dad's here. He's looking for you." His car in driveway, engine running, 7 missed calls. The choice: go down together or let her hide. Everything about to explode.

## Final Notes

This episode is about **pressure** - external forces trying to keep them apart while internal gravity pulls them together. Every scene should feel like somethingstretching to breaking point. The cliffhanger isn't just "will they get caught" but "what kind of person will Ethan choose to be in this moment?" That question carries into Episode 4.

The romance works because they're both excellent people who are choosing each other despite cost, not because they're the only option. Sophia's silver medal and Ethan's academic awards matter as much as their almost-kisses.

Make readers feel the frustration of "just kiss already!" while understanding exactly why they can't. Then take away even the space to make that choice themselves.
