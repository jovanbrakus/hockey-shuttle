## TOP 5 CRITICAL FIXES (Do These First)

1. **The 24-Hour Logic Gap** - Why doesn't Sophia tell Ethan immediately about the bribe?
   - ADD: Internal reasoning for her silence
   - LOCATION: Chapter 4, after Robert leaves

2. **Timeline Confusion** - Prep school date changes without explanation
   - ADD: "Playoffs delayed departure to January 4th"
   - LOCATION: Chapter 1, early mention

3. **Tyler Too Perfect** - He needs dimension and investment
   - ADD: One character flaw + why he specifically likes Sophia
   - LOCATION: Chapter 2, develop throughout

4. **Chapter 2 Pacing Drag** - Repetitive "this feels wrong" beats
   - CUT: 30% of repetitive material
   - ADD: Progression in Tyler's awareness
   - LOCATION: Throughout Chapter 2

5. **Missing Transition** - Robert's arrival too jarring after kiss
   - ADD: Morning-after scene before crisis
   - LOCATION: Chapter 4, between kiss and arrival

## KEY QUESTION TO ANSWER

**"Why doesn't Sophia immediately tell Ethan about his father's ultimatum?"**

This is your biggest logic problem. Everything else is refinement, but this breaks story credibility.

Options:
1. She wants to decide without influencing him
2. She fears he'll burn bridges with parents before leaving
3. She needs time to process the impossible choice
4. She's protecting him from the hurt until she decides

Pick ONE and make it crystal clear.

## SUCCESS METRIC

Episode 4 succeeds if readers:
1. Feel the torture of the wrong relationship
2. Celebrate the first kiss
3. Feel gutted by Robert's ultimatum
4. MUST read Episode 5 immediately

Currently achieving 1, 2, and 4. Need to strengthen 3 with better logic.
