# CHAPTER 2: THE WRONG EQUATION

## First Date

Saturday afternoon, December 2nd, and I'm standing in front of my closet having an existential crisis about what you wear on a date you don't actually want to be on. My phone's propped against my mirror, Maya on FaceTime providing unsolicited fashion advice.

"The blue sweater," she says, taking a bite of whatever she's eating. Sounds like chips. "It brings out your eyes and makes you look less like you're about to throw up."

"I'm not gonna throw up."

"Soph. You've literally changed outfits four times. For coffee." She holds up her fingers. "Coffee. Not the Met Gala."

She's right. I'm being ridiculous. It's just coffee with Tyler, who's genuinely nice and easy to talk to and definitely doesn't deserve whatever disaster energy I'm bringing to this.

I pull on the blue sweater, checking myself in the mirror. My phone buzzes with a notification—someone's Instagram story. I swipe it away without looking.

"Better?"

"Much. Now breathe."

I breathe. Sort of.

"Now put on actual pants instead of those study-til-3-AM joggers."

"They're comfortable."

"They're a cry for help." Maya's grinning though. "Also I saw Ethan's story from practice this morning. That boy looked rough."

My stomach twists. "I didn't see it."

"Liar. You always watch his stories." She studies me through the screen. "You two still not talking?"

"We're talking. Just... less."

"Because of his parents?"

"Yeah."

"That's bullshit, you know that right? Like, who cares what they think?"

If only it were that simple.

Ten minutes later, I'm in jeans and the blue sweater and my winter coat because it's -15°C and nobody cares about fashion when literal frostbite is on the table. Maya's switched from FaceTime to rapid-fire texts.

**maya:** have fun!!!
**maya:** be yourself!!!
**maya:** but like the fun version
**maya:** not the overthinking everything version
**maya:** actually nvm just be you he already likes you

I drive downtown to The Daily Grind—not my first choice (too close to campus where we might run into people), but Tyler suggested it and I didn't want to seem difficult. The coffee shop is packed with university students, laptops everywhere, that mix of espresso and stressed-student that's basically Winnipeg's official scent during finals.

Tyler's already there, corner table, scrolling through his phone. When he sees me, his whole face lights up. He's wearing that beat-up Canucks hoodie he basically lives in, and there's something comforting about how un-fancy this is.

"Hey," he says, standing up like this is way more formal than it is. "I ordered already—hope that's okay? Got you a vanilla latte? But I can get something else if—"

"Vanilla latte's perfect. Thanks."

We sit, and there's this moment where we both realize this is a Date with a capital D and suddenly forget how to be normal humans. Then Tyler laughs.

"This is weird as hell, right?"

"So weird."

"Okay good. Thought it was just me." He takes a sip of his coffee—black, which seems very hockey player of him. "So. Badminton. I've been googling it all week and I still don't get the scoring."

I laugh, something in my chest loosening. "Oh god, yeah, rally scoring is confusing at first..."

We talk about badminton for ten minutes—me explaining the rules, the difference between singles and doubles, why the shuttlecock moves the way it does (physics, always physics). Tyler asks surprisingly good questions, making jokes about how it seems way more complicated than hockey's "put puck in net, don't die" philosophy.

"But hockey has like a million penalties," I point out. "Icing, offsides, high-sticking—"

"Okay fine, every sport is complicated when you actually think about it."

"Exactly."

The conversation flows easier after that. School stuff—he's dying in AP Literature ("Why can't authors just say what they mean?"), I'm drowning in AP History ("I literally don't care about the War of 1812"). We talk about college plans—his hockey scholarship to UBC is basically set, just waiting on the official letter.

"But I'm doing marine biology too," he adds, almost shy about it.

"Wait, really?"

"I know, random as hell. But my family used to vacation in Tofino every summer when I was a kid. I got obsessed with tide pools. Like, seriously obsessed. My dad thought I'd grow out of it." He grins, and those dimples are genuinely unfair. "Spoiler: did not grow out of it."

"That's actually really cool though."

"Yeah? You don't think it's weird? Big hockey guy wanting to study fish?"

"No, it's like... you contain multitudes."

"Look at you, quoting Whitman. Maybe I should get you to tutor me in Lit too."

"Hard pass. I barely understand it myself."

"What about you?" he asks. "MIT still the dream?"

My chest tightens. MIT. Where Ethan wanted to go for engineering before his parents decided his life for him.

"Maybe. Or Caltech. Cornell. Princeton. I don't know." I wrap my hands around my mug, the warmth grounding me. "Depends on like, a million factors. Scholarships, mostly."

"You'll get in everywhere. Ethan says you're literally the smartest person he knows."

There it is. Ethan's name hanging between us like a challenge.

"Ethan exaggerates."

"Nah. He's pretty accurate about stuff like that." Tyler's quiet for a moment, playing with his coffee lid. "He's a good dude. Like, genuinely good. Best friend I've got on the team, which is saying something 'cause Marcus and Alex are solid too."

"Yeah. He is."

We keep talking—favorite shows (he's obsessed with this ocean documentary series, I'm rewatching Avatar for the hundredth time), music (we have zero overlap except somehow both love Taylor Swift's folklore), whether pineapple belongs on pizza (he says yes, I say that's offensive to both pineapples and pizza).

He tells me about his younger sister who plays hockey too, this tiny terror on ice who's definitely going to be better than him. I tell him about being an only child, about my mom's research that I don't fully understand, my dad's restaurant dreams that turned into accounting reality.

It's nice. Really nice.

And it feels completely, utterly wrong.

Not because Tyler's doing anything wrong—he's literally perfect. Attentive without being creepy, funny without trying too hard, actually listening when I talk instead of just waiting for his turn. But sitting here with him, laughing at his stories about practice disasters, learning he volunteers at the aquarium in summer, I keep having this feeling like I'm wearing someone else's life. Like I'm in a play and forgot my lines so I'm just making it up and hoping nobody notices.

My phone buzzes on the table. I flip it over without looking, but Tyler sees.

"You can check it. I'm not one of those guys who gets weird about phones."

"It's fine. Probably just Maya wanting updates."

"She seems cool. Very... intense about your life."

"That's one way to put it."

Two hours somehow pass. The coffee shop's getting that late afternoon rush—students desperate for caffeine before night study sessions. Tyler checks his phone and winces.

"Shit. Practice at five. Coach will murder me if I'm late again."

"Again?"

"Last week I got distracted watching octopus videos and lost track of time." He looks genuinely embarrassed. "I have a problem."

"There are worse problems to have."

We bundle up—the Manitoba winter slap is real—and he walks me the half block to my car. The cold makes talking impossible, but when we reach my Honda, he turns to face me.

"This was really fun," he says, breath clouding between us.

"Yeah, it was."

"Would you maybe want to do it again? Not immediately, but like, sometime?"

He's trying so hard. Standing there in the cold, snow starting to fall, genuinely hopeful. This nice, funny, uncomplicated boy who texts his sister octopus facts and wants to study the ocean.

I should say no. I should explain that I'm emotionally unavailable, that I'm dealing with complicated feelings, that he deserves someone whose heart races when he smiles instead of someone who feels nothing but mild friendliness.

But explaining would mean talking about Ethan. About impossible equations and family ultimatums and feelings I can't afford.

"Yeah," I hear myself say. "I'd like that."

Tyler's smile could power Winnipeg for a week. "Cool. Awesome. I'll text you."

He leans in—my whole body tenses—but he just kisses my cheek. Quick, gentle, respectful. His lips are warm and smell like coffee and...

Nothing.

I feel absolutely nothing.

"Drive safe," he says.

"You too."

I watch him walk away, probably already mentally preparing for practice, definitely not overthinking every word we just said. Must be nice.

I sit in my car for five minutes, heat blasting, trying to figure out what I'm doing. My phone has four messages.

**maya:** UPDATES???
**maya:** sophia chen dont leave me hanging
**maya:** if ur making out just say that
**maya:** ok but seriously how did it go

**me:** good! hes really nice

**maya:** that's it? nice?

**me:** really really nice?

**maya:** i'm gonna need more than that

**maya:** wait are you still with him???

**me:** no driving home

**maya:** AND???

**me:** and nothing. we had coffee. talked. it was nice.

**maya:** you keep saying nice

**maya:** that's like the worst adjective

**maya:** nice is what you say about weather

**maya:** or your grandma's friend

**maya:** do you actually like him??

I stare at that question for way too long.

**me:** i don't not like him

**maya:** omfg sophia

**maya:** that's literally the saddest thing

**maya:** you know what? we'll discuss tomorrow

**maya:** but honey... maybe think about what you actually want?

What I want. Right. Because that's not a loaded question at all.

I drive home past houses already going full Christmas decoration war—inflatable Santas battling light-up reindeer, that one house that definitely spends thousands on their display. When I pull in, my mom's car is there, which means she actually left the lab before midnight for once.

Inside, she's making tea, still in her work clothes—the lab coat draped over a kitchen chair.

"How was coffee?" she asks, not looking up from her mug.

Maya definitely texted her. They have this whole conspiracy thing going.

"It was nice."

Mom looks up. "Nice?"

"He's a nice guy, Mom."

"Hmm." She takes a sip of tea. "But?"

"No but. It was a nice date with a nice person."

"Sophia." She sets down her mug, giving me that look that means she's about to drop wisdom. "You know you're allowed to just... like someone, right? Without analyzing it to death?"

God, if only she knew about my actual equations.

"I know."

"And you also know you don't have to like someone just because they're nice, right?"

That stops me. "What?"

"I mean, sometimes people are lovely, perfect on paper, check all the boxes. But if your heart's not in it..." She shrugs. "That's okay too. Nice isn't enough if there's no spark."

I think about Tyler's smile, how easy our conversation was, that cheek kiss that felt like nothing. Then I think about just seeing Ethan in the hall and feeling like I might combust.

"What if you're not sure?" I ask quietly.

"Then give it time. But be honest—with him and yourself." She reaches over, squeezes my hand. "Don't date someone to prove something or because you think you should. That's not fair to anyone."

"I'm not—" But I can't finish that sentence because that's exactly what I'm doing.

"Okay." She doesn't push, just smiles. "I'm making dumplings. Want to help?"

We spend the next hour in the kitchen, folding dumplings while Mom tells me about her protein research that I pretend to understand. It's comfortable, normal, except for my phone buzzing every few minutes.

**tyler:** thanks again for today. you're really easy to talk to.

**me:** you too! see you monday

Then, thirty seconds later:

**ethan:** can we talk?

My heart does that thing where it forgets how to beat properly.

**me:** having dinner with family. sorry.

**ethan:** after?

**ethan:** please sophie

**ethan:** i don't understand what's happening

The dots appear and disappear for a solid minute before his next message.

**ethan:** did i do something wrong?

God, no. You did everything right. That's the problem.

**me:** you didn't do anything wrong

**me:** i just need some space to figure things out

**ethan:** figure what out?

**ethan:** is this about tyler?

**me:** no

**me:** maybe

**me:** i don't know

**ethan:** that's not really an answer

**me:** i know. i'm sorry.

**ethan:** stop apologizing and just talk to me

**ethan:** we're friends right? we can talk about stuff

Friends. The word hurts more than it should.

**me:** tomorrow. i promise. just... not tonight.

**ethan:** the forks? after practice?

Our place. Where everything started and got complicated and where I'll probably have to break both our hearts.

**me:** okay

**ethan:** thank you

I help Mom with dinner, barely eat anything, claim homework and escape to my room. But instead of homework, I pull out my physics notebook and return to my equation.

**E + S = ?**

Variable T (Tyler) = safe, nice, uncomplicated
But adding T doesn't solve for E + S
It just makes everything messier

My phone lights up with Instagram notifications. Without thinking, I open it.

Ethan posted a story from practice. He does look rough—tired, distracted. In the video, someone (sounds like Marcus) is chirping him about missing an easy shot. Ethan just shakes his head, that self-deprecating smile that means he's actually upset but hiding it.

I watch it three times before I realize what I'm doing and throw my phone across the room.

## Sunday at The Forks

I arrive at The Forks five minutes late, partly because of traffic, mostly because I sat in my car for ten minutes trying to figure out what to say.

Ethan's already there, sitting on our bench—the one by the river where we used to meet as kids, where we found each other again this year, where everything got complicated. He's wearing his navy winter coat, the one that makes his eyes look impossibly blue, and when he sees me, his whole face changes—relief and hurt and something else all mixed together.

"You came," he says when I sit down, leaving careful space between us.

"I said I would."

"Yeah, but lately..." He trails off.

Lately I've been a disaster of a human being. Yeah, I know.

"I'm sorry," I start, but he cuts me off.

"Stop apologizing and just tell me what's going on. Please. Because I'm going crazy trying to figure out what changed."

The river's partially frozen, that weird in-between state where water still moves under ice. Kind of like us—everything looks solid from the outside but underneath it's all currents and danger.

"Your parents—" I begin.

"Of course this is about my parents." He sounds exhausted. "What did they do now?"

"Nothing. Yet. But Jordan said—" I stop. I'm not supposed to know what Jordan knows.

"Jordan said what?"

"That they're planning something. To separate us. That they see me as a... distraction."

Ethan's quiet for a moment. Then: "So your solution is to do their work for them? Push me away before they can?"

When he puts it like that, it sounds stupid.

"I'm trying to protect you."

"From what? From my parents? Sophie, I've been dealing with them my whole life. I don't need protection."

"From having to choose. Between me and hockey. Between what you want and what your future needs."

"What if they're the same thing?"

"They're not. They can't be. You're leaving in a month—"

"Five weeks. And actually, it got pushed to January 4th because of playoffs."

"Okay, five weeks. Same difference. You'll be in Michigan, I'll be here, and long distance doesn't work, especially when you need to focus on hockey and I need to focus on nationals and college apps and—"

"So you decided to end it before it started? Without talking to me?"

"There's nothing to end. We're friends."

The word hangs between us like a lie we're both supposed to pretend is true.

"Right. Friends." He turns to look at me fully. "Is that why you can't look at me anymore? Why you're sitting as far away as physically possible? Why you're dating Tyler?"

"I'm not—we had one coffee date."

"You went to his game Friday."

"As friends."

"Sophie." He says my name like it hurts. "Please stop lying to me."

"I'm not—"

"You are. You're lying to me, to Tyler, to yourself. And I don't understand why."

Because if I tell the truth, everything falls apart. Because your parents have money and lawyers and power. Because I'd rather hurt now when we can still salvage friendship than later when we'll hate each other.

"It's complicated," I say weakly.

"Everything's complicated. That doesn't mean you run from it."

"Says the guy whose parents are literally sending him to another country—"

"Another state," he corrects.

"Whatever. They're removing you from the situation. How is that not running?"

"Because I don't have a choice. You do."

"No, I don't. Don't you get it? Your parents will never accept me. They'll make your life hell, threaten your hockey, pull funding—"

"Let them try."

"Ethan—"

"No, I'm serious. Let them try. What are they going to do? Stop paying for hockey? Fine, I'll get a job. Not pay for college? I'll get scholarships. They don't own me, Sophie."

"They own your future."

"They own the future they planned. Not the one I want."

We sit there, the winter sun already starting to set even though it's barely 4 PM. Winnipeg winters are brutal like that—darkness coming early, cold that seeps into your bones, everything trying to force you inside, away from hard conversations.

"Two weeks ago," Ethan says quietly, "at Jordan's party. When we were studying but really just talking. You laughed at something I said—I don't even remember what—but you laughed and looked at me and for a second I thought... I thought you felt it too."

"Felt what?"

"This. Whatever this is. Because I know we keep saying friends but Sophie, friends don't—" He stops, frustrated. "I don't look at Jordan the way I look at you. I don't think about Maya at 2 AM. I don't feel like I can't breathe right when Alex is sad."

My heart is doing dangerous things. "Ethan—"

"And I think—I hope—you feel something too. But instead of talking about it, you're pushing me away and dating someone else and acting like none of this matters."

"It matters," I whisper. "It matters too much. That's the problem."

"How is that a problem?"

"Because when you leave—"

"If. If I leave."

I look at him. "What?"

"I haven't decided if I'm going to prep school. The deadline to confirm isn't until December 20th."

"But... your parents—"

"Will be furious. Yeah. But it's my life, Sophie. My choice."

"You can't give up prep school. The exposure, the training, the scouts—"

"I'd be giving up one path. There are others. Plenty of NHL players didn't go to prep school."

"Your parents will—"

"What? Disown me? Doubt it. I'm their only investment." His smile is bitter. "They'll be angry, they'll threaten things, but eventually they'll adjust. They always do when they realize they can't control something."

"This is crazy. You can't throw away your future for—"

"For you?" He moves closer, and I forget how to breathe. "Sophie, I'm not throwing anything away. I'm choosing what matters."

"Hockey matters. Your career—"

"Will still exist whether I go to prep school or not. But this—us—if I leave now, if we don't even try, I'll regret it forever."

"There is no us," I say, but my voice shakes.

"There could be."

We're close enough now that I can see the gold flecks in his blue eyes, smell his cologne mixed with winter air, feel the warmth radiating off him in the cold.

"Ethan..."

"Tell me you don't feel anything," he says. "Look me in the eye and tell me you feel nothing, and I'll stop. I'll go to prep school, I'll leave you alone, I'll watch you date Tyler and pretend it doesn't kill me. But you have to mean it."

I open my mouth to lie. To say the words that will set us both free, that will make everything simple and safe and wrong.

But I can't.

Because I do feel something. Everything. Too much.

"I can't," I whisper.

"Can't what?"

"Can't tell you I feel nothing. But I also can't—we can't—your parents—"

"Forget my parents. For one second, forget them. What do you want?"

You. Always you. Since we were nine and you called me Watson. Since you came back into my life. Since every moment in between.

But I can't say that. Because Ethan doesn't know what his parents are capable of. He doesn't know about the conversation Jordan overheard, about the threats, about how far they're willing to go.

And if I tell him, he'll confront them. He'll blow up his life for me. And in five years, ten years, he'll resent me for it.

"I want you to be happy," I say finally.

"That's not what I asked."

"That's my answer."

He stares at me for a long moment. Then stands up, hands shoved in his pockets.

"You know what? Fine. Date Tyler. Pretend this is nothing. But don't lie to yourself about why you're doing it." He starts to walk away, then turns back. "And Sophie? When you realize pushing me away doesn't actually protect either of us, I'll still be here. But I won't wait forever."

He leaves me on the bench, in the cold, watching the river fight against freezing.

## After - The Witness

I sit there for another ten minutes, trying to process everything, when footsteps crunch on the snow behind me. I turn, expecting—hoping—it's Ethan coming back.

It's Robert Hayes.

My blood freezes colder than the river.

"Sophia," he says, that professionally pleasant voice that probably works great in boardrooms. "I thought that was you."

"Mr. Hayes." I stand, ready to leave, but he moves slightly, blocking the path.

"I saw Ethan leave. He seemed upset."

There's something in the way he says it—satisfaction, maybe? Like this is exactly what he wanted.

"We were just talking."

"Of course." He looks at the bench, the river, the spot where so much has happened. "You know, I remember when Ethan was younger, he'd come here to think. Always so emotional, that one. It's why hockey is good for him—channels all that feeling into something productive."

I don't respond. Anything I say will be wrong.

"I heard you're dating Tyler Kim now," he continues. "Good choice. He's going places—UBC, strong hockey program, academic scholarship too. The kind of boy with a real future."

The implication is clear: unlike you and Ethan together.

"Tyler's nice," I manage.

"Nice. Yes." Robert studies me like I'm a problem to be solved. "You know, Sophia, I actually admire what you're doing. It takes maturity to recognize when something isn't going to work. To step aside gracefully."

"I'm not—"

"Aren't you? Moving on with Tyler, giving Ethan space to focus on his career. It's very considerate." He smiles, and it's worse than anger would be. "His mother and I appreciate it. We know these teenage feelings can be so... intense. But you're being practical. Logical. I respect that."

He knows. Somehow, he knows exactly what I'm doing and why.

"I should go," I say.

"Of course. Oh, but Sophia? One more thing." He pulls out his phone, shows me a photo. It's from Jordan's party—Ethan and me looking at each other, that moment he talked about when I laughed and forgot to guard my expression. "Amazing what people post on social media these days. This was on someone's story. Maya's, I believe?"

My stomach drops. "You're watching Maya's Instagram?"

"Oh, not regularly. But when it concerns my son's future, I pay attention." He puts the phone away. "The thing is, Sophia, these feelings—they're obvious. To everyone. Which means if you suddenly pulled away, if you're dating someone else now, there must be a reason. A logical reason."

He knows. He knows I know about their plans.

"I really need to go—"

"The prep school decision is December 20th," he says, like I haven't spoken. "If Ethan chooses not to go—if something or someone influences that decision—well. That would be unfortunate. For everyone involved."

"Is that a threat?"

"It's a fact. Ethan's future has been carefully planned. Hockey, university, the connections he'll need. One impulsive decision now could unravel everything. But I'm sure you understand that. After all, you have your own future to think about. MIT, wasn't it?"

How does he know about MIT?

"That's none of your—"

"Everything concerning my son is my business. And you, Sophia, have been concerning me for months." He steps aside, finally letting me pass. "But it seems you're making better choices now. Tyler Kim. Winter formal. Moving on. Very mature."

I start walking away, fast, but his voice follows me.

"Oh, and Sophia? I'd hate for Ethan to know we talked. He's so reactive about these things. Might do something impulsive like refuse prep school out of spite. And that would be tragic, wouldn't it? All those opportunities, lost because of a misunderstanding."

I don't respond. I just walk faster, then run when I'm out of sight, my boots slipping on ice, my breath coming in gasps that have nothing to do with exertion.

When I reach my car, I lock the doors and sit there shaking.

Robert Hayes knows exactly what I'm doing. He's watching us through Instagram. He's making threats wrapped in polite conversation.

And now I understand with horrible clarity: if I tell Ethan about this conversation, he'll explode. He'll confront his father, refuse prep school, destroy his future out of anger and protection and love.

Which means I can never tell him.

Which means I have to keep pushing him toward Tyler, toward moving on, toward the life his parents planned.

My phone buzzes.

**ethan:** im sorry about earlier

**ethan:** i shouldn't have pushed

**ethan:** can we talk tomorrow?

I stare at the messages through tears.

**me:** we said everything already

**me:** please just let me figure this out

**ethan:** figure what out?

**ethan:** sophie what aren't you telling me?

Everything. So much everything.

**me:** nothing. i just need space.

**ethan:** from me specifically? or from everyone?

**ethan:** because you seem fine with tyler

That lands like a slap, which is probably what he intended.

**me:** that's not fair

**ethan:** nothing about this is fair

He's right. None of this is fair. Not him being controlled by his parents, not me being threatened, not Tyler being used as a shield, not any of it.

**me:** i have to go

**ethan:** sophie wait

But I turn off my phone and drive home, Robert Hayes's words echoing:
*Very mature.*

## Monday's Consequences

Monday morning comes too fast. I've had exactly three hours of sleep, my eyes are puffy from crying, and I have to face both Tyler and Ethan at school.

Maya corners me at my locker before first period.

"Okay, what the hell happened yesterday? Ethan looks like death, you look worse, and Tyler keeps asking if you're okay."

"Nothing happened."

"Sophia Chen, I've been your best friend for two years. I know your nothing-happened face. This is not it."

"Can we just... not? Please? I can't do this before physics."

She studies me, then pulls me into a hug. "Whatever it is, I'm here. Even if you're being stupid about it."

"Thanks. I think."

Physics is torture. Ethan's in his usual seat, I'm in the back, and Mr. Hendricks is talking about collision theory which feels like the universe personally attacking me. Every example is about things crashing into each other, transferring energy, changing direction.

I risk one glance at Ethan. He's staring at his textbook, but I can tell he's not reading. His jaw is clenched, that muscle jumping the way it does when he's upset.

My phone vibrates.

**tyler:** hey! you still good for my game friday?

**tyler:** also winter formal tickets go on sale tomorrow

**tyler:** should i get ours?

The timing is excruciating. I can practically feel Ethan tense from across the room, like he somehow knows what those messages say.

**me:** yes to both

**tyler:** awesome! what color dress?

**me:** haven't gotten one yet

**tyler:** well let me know so i can match

**tyler:** or not match if matching is weird

**tyler:** i have no idea how this works lol

Despite everything, I almost smile. Tyler's trying so hard to make this easy, to be the uncomplicated choice.

**me:** matching is nice

**tyler:** cool! also fair warning my mom wants to take 8million photos

**tyler:** she's already planning the whole pre-formal thing

**tyler:** you can say no if that's too much

It is too much. Everything is too much. But I can't explain that without explaining why.

**me:** sounds fun. moms love photos

After class, I bolt before Ethan can corner me. But Tyler's waiting by my locker, holding two coffee shop cups.

"Figured you might need caffeine," he says, handing me one. "Vanilla latte, right?"

"You didn't have to—"

"I know. But you seemed stressed yesterday, and I thought..." He shrugs. "I don't know. Coffee makes things better?"

He's so genuinely sweet it makes me want to cry.

"Thanks, Tyler. Really."

"Also, totally no pressure, but some of the team is going to Danny's after the game Friday. You could come? Bring Maya and whoever?"

"Sure. That sounds good."

He lights up. "Yeah? Cool. I should warn you, though, the guys can be... a lot. Like, imagine puppies. But six feet tall and constantly hungry."

"I think I can handle puppies."

We're laughing when Ethan walks by. He doesn't stop, doesn't acknowledge us, just keeps walking. But Tyler notices.

"Is he okay?" Tyler asks. "He's been off all week."

"I don't know," I lie.

"Maybe it's the prep school thing. That's got to be stressing him out."

"Yeah, maybe."

Tyler looks like he wants to say something else, but the warning bell rings.

"See you at lunch?" he asks.

"Actually, I have to work on my English essay in the library."

"Oh. Okay. Tomorrow then?"

"Yeah, tomorrow."

He squeezes my shoulder—that casual affection that should mean something but doesn't—and heads off.

I don't go to the library. I go to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall and try to remember how to breathe.

My phone buzzes.

**Unknown Number:** Smart choices, Sophia. Keep it up. -R.H.

Robert Hayes has my number. Robert Hayes is texting me.

I delete the message immediately, but the damage is done. He's watching. He knows about Tyler, about the distance I'm maintaining, about all of it.

There's no way out of this that doesn't end with someone getting hurt.

The question is whether it's going to be Ethan, Tyler, or me.

Or knowing my luck, all three.
