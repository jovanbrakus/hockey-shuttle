# CHAPTER 3: COMPLICATIONS

## College Applications

December 15th. MIT's early action deadline is today at 11:59 PM, and I'm sitting at my desk staring at the Common App essay that I've rewritten twelve times and still hate.

**Prompt: Describe a time when you faced an ethical dilemma. How did you resolve it, and what did you learn from the experience?**

I have 647 words about authenticity and truth and making hard choices. It's well-written, properly structured, hits all the right notes about personal growth and self-reflection.

It's also complete bullshit.

Because here's what I didn't write: I'm currently lying to a genuinely nice person about my feelings while pushing away someone I care about to protect them from their parents' expectations. I'm pretending I can logic my way out of emotions, that noble sacrifice makes me a good person, that doing the "right thing" feels anything other than devastating.

That's my actual ethical dilemma. But you can't write that in a college essay.

My phone buzzes. Maya: *How's the essay going?*

**ME:** Terrible. I hate everything I've written.

**MAYA:** You literally had Mr. Peterson call your writing "remarkably insightful" last week

**ME:** That was for history class. This is different.

**MAYA:** It's all just writing. Stop overthinking it and submit the damn thing.

Easy for her to say. She already submitted all her applications two weeks ago—art schools that want portfolios and passion, not perfect essays about ethical dilemmas.

I read through my essay one more time, change a semicolon to a period, change it back, and finally hit submit at 11:47 PM before I can talk myself out of it.

There. MIT, Caltech, Cornell, Princeton—all submitted.

Now I just have to wait until spring to find out if any of them want a girl who's excellent at physics and terrible at being honest.

I close my laptop and grab my phone. Three missed messages from Tyler, two from Jordan, and a notification that Ethan posted on Instagram—a photo of his team after practice, everyone exhausted and laughing. He's in the back, and he's not laughing.

I close Instagram without liking it.

## Winter Formal Preparation

"What about this one?"

Maya holds up a dress in a deep emerald green, floor-length, with a slit up one side that seems structurally ambitious.

"That's basically held together by hope and strategic tape," I say.

"It's fashion."

"It's a drafting hazard."

We're at the mall—Maya, her mom (acting as official fashion consultant), and me, trying to find dresses for winter formal. The dance is tomorrow night, and I've been avoiding this shopping trip for two weeks until Maya literally showed up at my house this morning and refused to leave without me.

"You need to actually pick something, Sophia," Mrs. Foster says, flipping through the rack with the practiced efficiency of someone who's been shopping with Maya for seventeen years. "The formal is tomorrow."

"I'm aware."

"Then be aware that being indecisive is still making a choice." She pulls out a dress in midnight blue. "This one. Try it."

It's simpler than Maya's choice—fitted at the top, flowing at the bottom, with thin straps and a back that dips lower than anything I'd normally wear. When I come out of the dressing room, Maya's mom gets that look that all moms get when their children's friends do something that meets approval.

"That's the one," she says.

I look at myself in the mirror. The dress is objectively beautiful—the blue makes my eyes look darker, the cut is flattering without being uncomfortable. I look like someone who belongs at a winter formal with a sweet hockey player who thinks I'm easy to talk to.

I look like someone I don't recognize.

"I don't know," I start.

"We're getting it," Maya declares. "No more indecision. This is the dress, those shoes, done."

Thirty minutes later, I'm the owner of a midnight blue dress, silver shoes I'll definitely twist my ankle in, and a sense of impending doom I can't quite shake.

"You're being weird again," Maya says as we're having lunch in the food court.

"I'm not being weird."

"You've been staring at your phone for five minutes without actually looking at anything on it."

I put my phone down. "Tyler asked what color my dress is. For the corsage."

"And?"

"And I told him blue."

"That's... good? That's what you're supposed to do?"

"I know."

"So why do you look like you're about to cry?"

I don't have a good answer for that. Or I do, but it's too honest: because getting a corsage makes this real in a way that going to coffee and holding hands at a movie isn't. Because Tyler's being thoughtful and perfect and I'm still thinking about someone else.

"Just stressed," I say. "Applications, regionals coming up, finals next week."

Maya doesn't look convinced, but she lets it go.

My phone buzzes. Tyler: *Blue. Got it. Pick you up at 7 tomorrow?*

**ME:** Sounds good.

Then, before I can stop myself, I open Ethan's contact. Our last conversation was three days ago, his message I never responded to: *We need to talk. Please.*

My thumb hovers over the keyboard. I type: *Hey.*

Delete it.

Type: *Are you going to formal tomorrow?*

Delete it.

Type: *I miss talking to you.*

Delete it.

Finally, I just close the messages and put my phone away.

"You know what you need?" Maya says. "You need to stop thinking for like, five consecutive minutes. Just exist. Be present. Enjoy tomorrow."

"I don't know how to stop thinking."

"I know. That's your whole problem." She steals one of my fries. "But try. For me. For yourself. For Tyler, who's a genuinely nice human being who doesn't deserve you being mentally checked out the entire formal."

She's right. She's absolutely right.

So why does trying to be present feel like lying?

## Winter Formal

Saturday, December 16th, and my mom is taking approximately seven thousand photos of me in my dress before Tyler even arrives.

"Mom, please. This is excessive."

"This is your first formal. I'm allowed to be excessive." She adjusts the camera angle. "Turn slightly to the left. Perfect."

My dad's watching from the doorway, looking vaguely confused by the entire concept of winter formal. "In China, we didn't have dances in high school."

"In China, you were too busy studying eighteen hours a day," Mom says without looking up from her camera.

"Exactly. Much more reasonable."

The doorbell rings at exactly 7:00 PM, because Tyler is nothing if not punctual. Dad answers it while I'm still trying to get Mom to put the camera away.

"Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen, nice to meet you." Tyler's voice carries from the entryway. "I'm Tyler Kim. Here to pick up Sophia."

He's wearing a suit—navy blue, with a tie that I realize with surprise matches my dress almost perfectly. His hair is styled instead of his usual casual mess, and he's holding a corsage box nervously.

"Sophia," he says when I come downstairs, and his smile is immediate and genuine. "You look amazing."

"Thanks. You too. I mean, you look good too."

Real smooth, Sophia.

He opens the corsage box—white roses with blue ribbon, simple and pretty. When he slips it onto my wrist, his hands are gentle and I feel absolutely nothing except guilt that I feel nothing.

Mom takes another thousand pictures of us together—Tyler standing awkwardly, me trying to smile naturally, both of us looking like we're posing for the world's most wholesome stock photo about teen romance.

"Have fun," Mom says as we're finally leaving. "Be safe. Text me when you get there."

"And when you leave," Dad adds. "And if anything seems wrong."

"Dad, it's a school formal. In a hotel ballroom. What's going to go wrong?"

Famous last words, apparently.

---

Tyler drives us to the Fairmont—the fancy hotel downtown where the school rented a ballroom. The whole entrance is decorated with white lights and fake snow and silver streamers that are probably supposed to look elegant but mostly look like someone attacked a craft store.

"Ready?" Tyler asks as we're walking in.

"As I'll ever be."

Inside, the ballroom is transformed—more lights, more decorations, a DJ set up at one end and tables scattered around the edges. It's already crowded, people in suits and dresses, everyone looking simultaneously excited and awkward.

I spot Maya immediately—she's wearing a burgundy dress that's somehow elegant and bold at the same time, and she's standing with Jordan, who looks uncomfortable in his suit.

"Soph!" she calls, waving us over. "You look incredible!"

"So do you."

"I know." She grins, then looks at Tyler. "Nice tie coordination."

"Right? We didn't even plan it." Tyler's hand finds my lower back, a casual gesture that probably looks natural to everyone else but makes me hyperaware of where we're standing.

The four of us talk for a while—Maya and Jordan are doing their usual dance of almost-flirting but not-quite-committing, Tyler's making jokes that actually land, and I'm trying to be present like Maya said. To enjoy this moment instead of overthinking it.

Then I see him.

Ethan, across the ballroom, in a black suit that fits perfectly and makes him look older somehow. He's with a girl—tall, blonde, wearing a red dress. I recognize her vaguely from AP Lit. Sarah something.

They're not holding hands, but they're standing close enough that they came together.

My stomach drops.

"You okay?" Tyler asks quietly.

"Yeah. Just warm. It's warm in here."

"Want to get some air?"

I should say no. I should stay here and dance with my date and stop looking across the ballroom at someone else's date.

But I nod, and we head out to the hotel's terrace—a covered outdoor space with heaters and city lights visible beyond. It's freezing, but the heaters make it bearable, and there are a few other couples out here talking quietly.

"Better?" Tyler asks.

"Yeah. Thanks."

We stand at the railing, looking out at downtown Winnipeg lit up for Christmas. Tyler's quiet for a moment, then: "Can I ask you something?"

My heart rate picks up. "Sure."

"Is this okay? Us, I mean. Because you seem..." He pauses, searching for words. "You seem like you're somewhere else."

I want to lie. To tell him everything's fine, that I'm just stressed about school, that I'm having a great time.

But Maya's voice is in my head: *Be honest.*

"I'm sorry," I say quietly. "You're right. I've been distracted."

"Is it the college stuff?"

"Partly."

"What's the other part?"

I look at him—at his genuine concern, his patient expression, the way he's trying so hard to understand. He deserves better than my half-truths.

"There's someone else," I say, and the words feel like confession. "Not—I'm not seeing anyone else. But there's someone I have... history with. Feelings I'm trying to figure out."

Tyler's quiet for a long moment. "Price?"

I blink. "How did you—"

"The way you look at each other. Or don't look at each other, which is somehow more obvious." He leans against the railing. "He talks about you a lot. Like, a lot. And at study group, the way you both act around each other..." He trails off. "I'm not blind, Sophia."

"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have—"

"Said yes when I asked you to formal? Probably not." But his tone isn't angry, just resigned. "But you did, and we're here, so. What now?"

"I don't know."

"Do you want to be with him?"

Yes. No. Maybe. It's complicated.

"He's leaving in two weeks," I say instead of answering. "Prep school in Michigan. And his parents don't approve of us being together anyway."

"So you're dating me instead?"

"No. I mean—that's not why I said yes. You're great, Tyler. Really. You're funny and smart and kind, and on paper we make perfect sense."

"But in reality?"

"In reality, I can't stop thinking about someone else. And that's not fair to you."

Tyler's quiet again, and I brace myself for anger or hurt or disappointment. But when he speaks, his voice is gentle.

"I appreciate you being honest." He turns to face me fully. "For what it's worth, I like you, Sophia. I think you're brilliant and interesting, and in a different situation, I'd probably be trying really hard to change your mind. But I'm not going to compete with someone you've known since you were kids."

"Tyler—"

"It's okay. Really." He manages a small smile. "Can I give you some advice though?"

"Sure."

"Whatever's complicated between you and Price? It's only as complicated as you make it. Yeah, he's leaving. Yeah, his parents are controlling. But you're both smart enough to figure it out if you actually try." He pushes off the railing. "Don't waste time being noble when you could just be honest."

It's almost exactly what Maya said.

"Can we still finish the formal?" I ask. "As friends?"

"We can finish as friends." He offers his arm. "Come on. Let's go make the most of our matching outfits before this hotel kicks us out."

We go back inside, and something's shifted—the tension that's been there for two weeks is finally gone. We're just two people at a dance, no expectations, no pretending.

We dance to a few songs—Tyler's a surprisingly good dancer, and when he spins me out and back in during some pop song I don't know the name of, I actually laugh.

"There it is," he says. "An actual genuine smile."

"Sorry I've been such a disaster of a date."

"You haven't been a disaster. Just distracted." He glances across the dance floor. "And speaking of distractions..."

I follow his gaze. Ethan and Sarah are dancing—a slow song now, her hands on his shoulders, his hands at her waist. They're talking about something, Sarah laughing at whatever he said.

It shouldn't hurt. I'm the one who pushed him away. I'm the one who started dating someone else first.

But it hurts anyway.

"You should talk to him," Tyler says quietly.

"Now?"

"After. Tonight, tomorrow, whenever. But soon. Because whatever's between you two isn't going away just because you're both pretending it doesn't exist."

The song ends, and Tyler bows dramatically. "And on that note, I need to use the bathroom. Try not to stare too obviously while I'm gone."

He walks off, leaving me standing at the edge of the dance floor. The DJ's between songs, people moving between dancing and tables and the refreshment area.

I should find Maya. Or get water. Or literally anything except what I'm about to do.

But I'm walking across the dance floor anyway, weaving through people, until I'm standing in front of Ethan and Sarah.

"Hey," I say.

They both turn. Sarah smiles politely. Ethan looks surprised.

"Sophia," he says. "Hi."

"Can I talk to you? Just for a minute?"

Sarah glances between us, clearly picking up on something. "I'll go find my friends. Nice meeting you, Ethan."

She leaves, and then it's just us standing in the middle of a formal, surrounded by people and somehow completely alone.

"You look beautiful," Ethan says quietly.

"Thanks. You too. I mean, you look good. Not beautiful. Well, not that you couldn't be beautiful, but—"

"I get it." His smile is small, familiar. "What did you want to talk about?"

Everything. Nothing. How much I've missed him. How wrong it felt pushing him away. How I don't know how to fix this mess I've made.

"I'm sorry," I say. "For the last two weeks. For being weird and distant and not just being honest with you."

"Why weren't you?"

"Because I was trying to make things easier. Your parents, prep school, all of it. I thought if I pulled away now, it would hurt less when you left."

"Did it work?"

"No. It hurt more."

The DJ starts another slow song. Around us, couples are pairing up, moving back onto the dance floor.

"Dance with me?" Ethan asks.

"I'm here with Tyler."

"Who's currently nowhere in sight and who you're clearly not actually dating based on the fact that you're standing here with me."

He's not wrong.

I take his offered hand, and we move into the dance—his hands finding my waist, mine on his shoulders, the distance between us smaller than it should be for people who are "just friends."

"This isn't working," I say quietly.

"Dancing? Because I think we're doing okay."

"This. Us pretending there's nothing between us."

"There's definitely something between us." His voice is low, just for me. "There's been something between us since we were nine years old."

"Ethan—"

"Let me finish. Please." He takes a breath. "I know my parents are problems. I know I'm leaving in less than two weeks. I know long distance is hard and we're both busy and there are approximately seven thousand reasons this is complicated."

"So what do we do?"

"We stop pretending." His eyes meet mine, that impossible blue. "We stop trying to do the noble thing and just do the honest thing. Because Sophie, these last two weeks have been the worst two weeks I've had in years. And that includes my dad's lectures about my hockey career and that time I got food poisoning from gas station sushi."

Despite everything, I laugh. "Gas station sushi? Really?"

"Marcus dared me. It was a terrible decision." His hands tighten slightly at my waist. "But not as terrible as watching you date someone else and pretending I was fine with it."

"You were with Sarah tonight."

"As friends. She asked if I was going, I said probably, she asked if we could split an Uber. That's it." He pauses. "Were you jealous?"

"Maybe."

"Good. Because I was definitely jealous of Tyler Kim. Irrationally, completely jealous."

We're still dancing, moving in small circles, the song building around us. This close, I can see the flecks of darker blue in his eyes, the small scar above his left eyebrow from when he fell learning to skate as a kid.

"I don't know how to do this," I admit. "You leave December 28th. Spring break is all we'd have until June. Your parents—"

"Will deal with it. We'll figure it out." His forehead touches mine. "Sophie, I don't have all the answers. But I know I don't want to spend the next two weeks avoiding you because we're both scared."

"I'm terrified," I whisper.

"Me too."

"What if it doesn't work?"

"What if it does?"

The song is ending. Around us, people are breaking apart, getting ready for whatever's next. But we stay like this for another moment, foreheads together, barely swaying, just breathing the same air.

Then someone's phone flashes nearby—taking a photo—and the spell breaks.

We step apart.

"I should find Tyler," I say. "He deserves to know what I'm doing."

"Yeah. And I should probably tell Sarah I'm ditching her for the rest of the night."

"You're ditching her?"

"If you want me to? I'd rather spend the rest of formal with you than pretending to be on a date I'm not actually on."

I smile despite everything. "Let me talk to Tyler first. Make sure he's okay with it."

"I'll be right here."

I find Tyler at the refreshment table, drinking punch and talking to Marcus about something hockey-related. When he sees me, he excuses himself.

"So?" he asks.

"So... would you be okay if I spent the rest of the night with Ethan? I know that's terrible date etiquette—"

"Sophia. Go. It's fine." He grins. "I release you from date obligations. Be free. Be honest. All that important stuff."

"You're sure?"

"Positive. Plus, now I can go hang out with the team without feeling guilty about abandoning you." He pulls me into a quick hug. "For what it's worth? I think you guys will figure it out. You're both overthinking nerds who care too much about doing the right thing. It's annoyingly perfect."

I hug him back, grateful for his grace, his kindness, his ability to make this less painful than it could have been.

"Thank you, Tyler. For everything."

"Anytime. Now go get your hockey player."

I go back to where Ethan's waiting, and he looks up with a question in his eyes.

"Tyler's okay with it," I say.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

His smile is the first real one I've seen from him in two weeks. "Good. Because I'm not letting you out of my sight for the rest of the night."

"That might make bathroom breaks difficult."

"You know what I mean."

We spend the rest of formal together—dancing to slow songs and fast songs, getting terrible hotel cookies from the refreshment table, talking to Maya and Jordan (who both look absurdly pleased with this development), stealing moments at the edge of the ballroom where we can hear each other without shouting over the DJ.

It feels right in a way that nothing has felt right for weeks.

Around 10:30, people start leaving. Tyler finds us to say goodbye—he's getting a ride with some teammates, waves off my offer to drive him since we came together.

"I'll text you next week," he says. "We can study for Henderson's final."

"I'd like that."

He leaves, and then it's just scattered groups remaining. Maya and Jordan already left an hour ago. The DJ's packing up. The decorations somehow look sadder now, like the magic is wearing off.

"Want to get out of here?" Ethan asks.

"Where would we go? It's 10:30 on a Saturday night in Winnipeg in December."

"I have an idea."

## The Parking Lot Conversation

Fifteen minutes later, we're in the hotel parking lot, standing by my car, and I'm realizing what's about to happen.

We're about to talk. Really talk. About all of it—the feelings we've been dancing around, the complications we've been avoiding, the two weeks until he leaves and what happens after.

"So," Ethan says.

"So."

We both laugh nervously.

"This is weird," I say. "We've never been weird."

"We've been weird for two weeks."

"Fair point."

Ethan leans against my car, looking up at the sky. It's clear tonight, stars visible despite the city lights, the kind of cold that makes your breath cloud instantly.

"I'm leaving December 28th," he says. "Dad's already got the flight booked, the housing arranged, the whole thing set up."

"I know."

"Spring break is March 10th. That's eleven weeks."

I knew it was going to be bad, but hearing the actual number makes it real. "That's a long time."

"Yeah." He looks at me. "But then I'm back for ten days. And then summer after that. It's not ideal, but it's not forever."

"Your parents—"

"Are going to have opinions. Lots of them. And we'll deal with them." His jaw sets in that stubborn way I remember from when we were kids. "I'm not giving up hockey. But I'm also not giving up you."

"What if you have to choose?"

"Then I choose both and figure out how to make it work." He reaches for my hand. "Sophie, I've spent six years thinking about you. Six years wondering what happened to my best friend, if you still loved math, if you still made that face when you're concentrating. And then you showed up sophomore year, and it was like—"

"Like coming home," I finish quietly.

"Yeah. Exactly like that." His thumb traces circles on my hand. "I'm not walking away from that because it's complicated. Everything worth having is complicated."

"What if long distance doesn't work?"

"Then we try anyway and at least we tried. But Sophie, we texted every single day for months before you even knew I was texting. I think we can handle actual intentional long distance."

He's right. We've been doing a version of this already—the constant communication, the sharing everything, the way we gravitate toward each other.

"Okay," I say.

"Okay?"

"Okay, let's try. Let's figure this out. Let's stop being noble and just be honest." I step closer. "I want this. You. Us. Whatever this is."

His smile is bright enough to light up the parking lot. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"So can I kiss you now? Because I've been wanting to kiss you for approximately eight years and I'm running out of patience."

I laugh, and it feels like relief. "Not yet."

"What? Why not?"

"Because we're in a hotel parking lot and it's freezing and also—" I pull out my phone. "Also, Tyler's technically still my formal date for another hour, and I feel like there should be a grace period."

"You're making up rules."

"I'm establishing boundaries. It's healthy."

"It's torture."

"Eleven weeks, remember? This is just one more hour."

Ethan groans but he's smiling. "Fine. One hour. But then—"

"Then we'll figure it out."

We stand there in the cold, holding hands, making plans for the next two weeks. He has games Wednesday and Friday. I have badminton practice every afternoon. We have study group next week, finals the week after that, Christmas somewhere in there.

It's not enough time. But it's what we have.

"I should go home," I say finally. "My parents have a curfew even for formal nights."

"I'll follow you. Make sure you get there safe."

"Ethan, I've been driving for a year."

"Humor me."

So he follows me home through empty streets, his headlights in my rearview mirror the whole way. When we pull into my driveway, he parks on the street and walks over to my car.

"One hour," he says, checking his phone. "It's 11:15."

"So 12:15."

"I'll text you at 12:16."

"So specific."

"I'm a specific person."

I laugh and get out of my car, and we stand there in my driveway with winter pressing in around us.

"Thank you," I say. "For tonight. For not giving up. For—"

"You don't have to thank me for this. For us."

"Still. Thank you."

He kisses my cheek—the same spot Tyler kissed earlier, but this time I feel everything. My whole body lights up from that one gentle contact.

"Goodnight, Watson."

"Goodnight, Sherlock."

I watch him drive away, then go inside where my parents are pretending they weren't watching from the window.

"Good night?" Mom asks.

"Complicated night. But good."

I go upstairs and change out of my dress, hanging it carefully because despite everything, it was the dress I was wearing when Ethan asked me to try. When we stopped pretending.

At 12:16 exactly, my phone buzzes.

**ETHAN:** Hour's up. Can I kiss you tomorrow?

**ME:** Maybe. We'll see how tomorrow goes.

**ETHAN:** Tease.

**ME:** Absolutely.

**ETHAN:** Goodnight, Sophie. For real this time.

**ME:** Night, Ethan.

I put my phone down and lie in bed, staring at my ceiling, feeling lighter than I have in weeks.

We still have to deal with his parents. With prep school. With college applications and long distance and all the complications we've been trying to avoid.

But for now, tonight, we've stopped lying.

That feels like a start.

## Sunday Afternoon

I'm at The Forks the next day when Tyler texts.

**TYLER:** Hey. How'd the rest of formal go?

**ME:** Good. Really good. Thank you again for being so understanding.

**TYLER:** No problem. You guys looked happy. That's good.

**ME:** How are you doing?

**TYLER:** Honestly? A little disappointed but mostly relieved. Dating someone who's in love with someone else is exhausting.

**ME:** I wasn't—

**TYLER:** Sophie. You were. And that's okay. Just be happy, yeah?

**ME:** I'll try.

**TYLER:** Good. And if Price hurts you I'll hit him in practice.

**ME:** Please don't give him a concussion before prep school.

**TYLER:** Only if he deserves it.

I smile at my phone, grateful for Tyler's friendship even though the dating thing didn't work.

I'm sitting on a bench near the river—the same area where Ethan and I used to meet as kids, now frozen and covered in snow. It's 2 PM on a Sunday, families ice skating on the cleared paths, holiday music playing from somewhere.

My phone buzzes again. Ethan: *Where are you?*

**ME:** The Forks. Why?

**ETHAN:** Stay there. I'm coming.

**ME:** Why?

**ETHAN:** You'll see.

Twenty minutes later, he shows up in his winter coat and that ridiculous Beavers toque that Jordan got him as a joke. He's carrying two paper cups from the coffee kiosk nearby.

"Hot chocolate," he says, handing me one. "Extra marshmallows."

"You remembered."

"I remember everything about you."

We sit on the bench together, drinking hot chocolate, watching people skate. It's the most normal we've been in weeks—just existing in the same space without tension or complications.

"So," Ethan says eventually. "12:16 was eight hours ago."

"You're still on that?"

"I'm a patient person. But my patience has limits."

"We're in public."

"So?"

"So there are like, fifty families around us."

"And?"

I look at him—at the smile playing at his lips, the way his eyes are bright in the winter sun, the small cloud of breath in the cold air. At the boy I've known since I was nine and somehow just figured out I'm in love with.

"You're ridiculous," I say.

"You like that about me."

"Debatable."

He sets down his hot chocolate on the bench, then takes mine and sets it down too. Then he's turning to face me fully, and my heart is racing because I know what's about to happen.

"Sophia Chen," he says, mock-serious. "Can I kiss you now? In front of all these families and the Christmas music and probably someone's grandmother?"

I laugh. "You're making it sound super romantic."

"I'm working with what I've got."

"Okay. Yes. You can kiss me now."

"Finally."

And then he does.

It's not like the movies—there's no swelling music or perfect lighting. It's just us on a bench at The Forks in -20°C weather, tasting like hot chocolate, both of us smiling too much for it to be technically good kissing.

But it's perfect anyway.

When we break apart, someone nearby wolf-whistles. Ethan flips them off without looking, and I'm laughing against his shoulder.

"Worth the wait?" I ask.

"Worth everything."

We sit there for another hour, drinking cold hot chocolate, holding hands with our gloves on, making plans for the next two weeks. He has to tell his parents about us. I have to survive finals and badminton regionals. We both have to figure out how to do long distance when he leaves.

But right now, in this moment, everything feels possible.

My phone buzzes. Maya: *DID YOU KISS HIM YET?*

**ME:** Maybe.

**MAYA:** SOPHIA CHEN.

**ME:** Okay fine yes. We kissed.

**MAYA:** FINALLY. Jordan owes me $20.

**ME:** You bet on us?

**MAYA:** Everyone bet on you. Maya put money on before Christmas. I said yesterday. I won.

I show Ethan the texts, and he's laughing.

"They bet on us?"

"Apparently we're very predictable."

"Or everyone saw what we were too scared to admit."

"That too."

We stay at The Forks until sunset, until the cold gets too brutal even with hot chocolate, until we both have to go home and face reality.

But for now, for these few hours, we're just two people who finally stopped pretending.

It's the best Sunday I've had in years.

## Wednesday, December 20th - Study Group

Study group on Wednesday is different.

For one thing, Ethan and I show up together. For another, when we sit down on Jordan's couch, we sit next to each other instead of leaving deliberate space between us.

Maya sees it immediately and grins so wide I'm worried her face will split.

"So," she says, drawing out the word. "Anything new to share with the group?"

"Maya," Jordan warns. "Let them be."

"I'm not doing anything! I'm just asking if there's any news!"

"We're together," Ethan says simply, his hand finding mine on the couch between us. "In case that wasn't obvious."

"It was extremely obvious," Marcus says from where he's sprawled on the floor. "You two have been doing the sad longing thing for weeks. This is way better."

"The sad longing thing?" I repeat.

"So much sad longing," Alex agrees. "It was painful to watch."

Tyler comes down the stairs at that moment, and there's a beat of awkwardness before he just smiles.

"Finally," he says, and his tone is genuine. "Now maybe Price will stop moping during practice."

"I don't mope," Ethan protests.

"You absolutely mope."

We settle into studying after that, but it's different now. Better. Ethan helps me with a calc problem, his arm along the back of the couch behind me. I explain a physics concept to Tyler, and there's no tension, just friends helping friends.

Around 8:30, Jordan's mom brings down pizza—apparently she's decided we need feeding—and we take a break to eat.

"So," Maya says, because apparently she can't help herself. "What's the plan? With prep school and everything?"

It's the question everyone's been avoiding asking.

"We're going to try long distance," I say. "He leaves on the 28th. Spring break is March. We'll figure it out."

"That's really mature of you both," Jordan says.

"Or really stupid," Marcus adds. "No offense, but long distance in junior year? That's brutal."

"We know," Ethan says. "But we're doing it anyway."

Tyler raises his pizza slice in a mock toast. "To stupid decisions and trying anyway."

"That's not inspiring," I say.

"It's honest."

We all clink pizza slices because we're ridiculous, and then someone brings up finals and we spend the next hour complaining about Henderson's calc test and Peterson's history final and trying to memorize physics equations.

It's normal. It's good.

It's everything I was trying to protect by pushing Ethan away, except better because we're not pretending anymore.

When study group ends, Ethan walks me to my car even though it's literally in Jordan's driveway.

"Eleven days," he says.

"Until you leave?"

"Yeah." He wraps his arms around me, and I let myself sink into the hug. "That's eleven days to spend time together before long distance starts. What do you want to do?"

"Survive finals?"

"Besides that."

"I don't know. Normal things. Study together, get coffee, exist in the same space without overthinking everything."

"I can do that."

We stand there for a moment, just holding each other in the cold.

"Hey," I say quietly. "Are you scared?"

"Terrified."

"Me too."

"But we're doing it anyway."

"We're doing it anyway."

He kisses me goodnight—quick but sweet, because Jordan's probably watching from the window—and I drive home feeling like despite everything complicated ahead, we're finally moving in the right direction.

My phone buzzes at a stoplight.

**ETHAN:** Thank you for trying. For giving us a chance.

**ME:** Thank you for not giving up. Even when I was being stupid.

**ETHAN:** You weren't stupid. Just scared.

**ME:** Same thing.

**ETHAN:** Not even close.

I drive home with a smile on my face, for once not overthinking what comes next.

We have eleven days. Then spring break. Then summer.

It's not perfect. But it's ours.

And that feels like enough.
