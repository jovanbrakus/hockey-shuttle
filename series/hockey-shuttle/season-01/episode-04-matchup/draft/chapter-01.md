# CHAPTER 1: THE SETUP

## The Decision

The problem with physics is that it's supposed to make sense. You input the correct variables, apply the correct equations, and you get the correct answer. It's clean. Predictable. Safe.

Love doesn't work that way.

2 AM and I can't stop scribbling physics equations. Not homework—just me trying to math my way out of what Jordan told me three hours ago. Like there's some formula that'll make this make sense.

*They're going to separate you. And they're going to make it look like it's for his own good.*

My pen scratches across the paper:

**Variable E** = Ethan's future (hockey career, family expectations, prep school)

**Variable S** = Me (our friendship, whatever this... thing is, the way my whole body goes haywire when he smiles)

**Variable T** = Time (he leaves January 4th—pushed back from December 28th because of hockey playoffs, but still. Less than five weeks.)

**Variable H** = Hayes Family (money, power, legal maneuvering, threats)

I draw the equation:

**E + S = ?**

The answer should be simple. But every way I work it, someone loses.

If E + S = together → H intervenes → E loses everything

If E - S = apart → E's future secure → S loses everything → E loses S

There's no solution where we both win.

Outside my window, Winnipeg is settling into real winter. The kind of cold that literally bites, that makes your breath visible in clouds, that turns the world sharp and brittle. November sliding into December. The trees are bare skeletons, the grass buried under snow that squeaks when you walk on it, and everything feels like it's holding its breath, waiting for something to break.

My phone buzzes. I already know who it is before I look.

**ethan:** u ok? jordan said u left kinda fast

My thumb hovers over the keyboard. Five weeks. That's all we have before his parents ship him off to Michigan, to some prep school where NHL scouts watch every practice and his father's investment in his future becomes inescapable.

Five weeks where I could be selfish. Where I could keep pretending we're just friends who can't stop looking at each other, who text until 3 AM about literally nothing, who've somehow memorized each other's breathing patterns.

Or five weeks where I could do the right thing.

I type: **yeah just tired**

Delete it. Too casual.

**I'm fine. Just tired. Talk tomorrow?**

Delete. Still wrong.

Finally: **yeah im good. talk tmrw?**

The dots appear immediately. Disappear. Appear again. My heart does this stupid stuttering thing.

**ethan:** sure. sleep well watson

I stare at that nickname—the one he's called me since we were nine and decided I was Sherlock and he was my Watson, even though he insisted it should be the other way around. The one that used to mean we were partners in everything.

The one I'm about to make mean nothing.

I close my notebook, the equation unsolved, and turn off my light. But I don't sleep. I lie there in the dark, listening to winter wind rattling my window, and make the hardest decision of my life.

Tomorrow, I start walking away.

## Monday Morning

The thing about avoiding someone you see every day? It requires, like, constant vigilance. Ethan and I have synchronized schedules—AP Physics together, lunch with the same group, study sessions at Jordan's. We exist in overlapping orbits, planets circling the same sun.

Changing that orbit requires force. Deliberate, painful force.

Monday morning I take the long route to my locker, the one that goes past the gym and smells like old sneakers. I check my phone obsessively—someone already posted about the party Saturday night on their story, Maya's complaining about homework in the group chat, there's a TikTok about college apps that makes me want to throw my phone.

I time my arrival to Physics perfectly—slip in right as the bell rings, no chance for our usual pre-class conversation about whatever random thing we talked about until 2 AM. I take a seat in the back instead of our usual spot in the third row.

He notices immediately. Of course he does.

When Mr. Hendricks drones on about momentum and force vectors, Ethan keeps glancing back. I can feel his eyes like actual weight, but I don't look up. I focus on my notes with laser precision, writing down every word like this is the most important lecture I've ever attended. My handwriting gets progressively worse as my hand cramps.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. Once, twice, three times.

I don't check it.

After class, I'm the first one out the door, mumbling something about needing to talk to Coach Martinez about badminton practice. It's not even a lie—I do need to talk to her about regionals in January. Just not, like, right this second.

But it gets me out of the hallway before Ethan can catch up.

At lunch, I sit between Maya and Jordan, putting them as human shields between me and the empty chair that's always been Ethan's. When he arrives, tray in hand, that confused-hurt look making me want to die, I'm deep in conversation with Maya about our upcoming match against Churchill.

"Soph," Ethan says, standing at the edge of our table.

"Hey." Bright. Friendly. Distant. I hate myself. "How's your, um—" I gesture vaguely at his tray.

"My lunch?"

"Yeah, is it... good?"

He blinks. "I literally just got here."

"Oh. Right." God, kill me. I turn back to Maya. "So you were saying about their singles player?"

There's this horrible moment where Ethan just stands there, trying to figure out what's happening. Then he takes the chair across from me instead of next to me. The table suddenly feels huge, like we're on opposite continents.

Jordan shoots me a look that says *what the hell are you doing?* I give him one back that says *what you told me to*.

Except Jordan didn't tell me to do this. He told me Ethan's parents were planning something. He didn't say I should help them.

That's all me.

"So," Tyler Chen says—different Tyler, not hockey Tyler, this is calc-class Tyler—"did everyone see that insane Leafs game last night?"

The conversation shifts to hockey, which I tune out. Ethan contributes normally, but I catch him watching me three times. Each time I look away first, suddenly fascinated by my untouched sandwich.

By the end of lunch, my stomach hurts and I haven't eaten anything.

"Okay, what the actual fuck?" Maya says as we're walking to History.

"Language," I say weakly.

"Don't deflect. You're being weird with Ethan."

"I'm not being weird."

"Sophia. You sat between me and Jordan like we're human shields. You asked about his lunch like you're an alien trying to understand human food. And I'm pretty sure you just agreed to help with the winter fundraiser, which you literally hate."

I stop walking. "I did?"

"See? Weird." Maya's braids swing as she faces me fully, hands on hips. "What happened? Did you guys fight?"

"No."

"Did he do something?"

"No. Maya, it's fine."

"It's clearly not fine. You look like you're gonna cry, and he looks like someone murdered his dog. So what's going on?"

I want to tell her. Maya's been my best friend since sophomore year—she's the one who made Winnipeg feel less like exile and more like home. She knows about the childhood friendship with Ethan, the reunion, the slowly building something that neither of us has actually said out loud.

But I can't explain that I'm doing this to protect him without explaining what I'm protecting him from. And Jordan told me about Ethan's parents in confidence.

"His parents want him to focus on hockey," I say finally. It's not a lie. "And I'm... a distraction."

Maya's expression shifts from confused to pissed. "They said that?"

"Not to me directly. But yeah, basically."

"So you're just... what? Ghosting him?"

"I'm not ghosting. I'm giving him space."

"Space he clearly doesn't want."

"Space he needs."

Maya stares at me, and I can see her trying to decide whether to push. Finally, she sighs. "Soph, this is literally one of those things where you're overthinking it."

"Maybe."

"And you look miserable."

"I'm fine."

"Right. And I'm dating Harry Styles." She loops her arm through mine anyway. "Come on. We're already late, and Peterson's still mad about my French Revolution essay."

We walk to class, but I'm only half listening to Maya's story about how she accidentally wrote that Marie Antoinette invented cake. The other half of me is trying not to think about the hurt confusion on Ethan's face at lunch.

Five weeks, I remind myself. Just five weeks, and he'll be gone anyway. This way it hurts less.

The problem is, it already hurts so much I can barely breathe.

## Thursday Lunch

By Thursday, I've gotten better at the avoidance thing. Different routes to classes, strategic seating, always having somewhere urgent to be. It's exhausting, like playing three-dimensional chess against someone who knows all your moves.

I'm at my locker, switching books for afternoon classes, when Tyler Kim appears next to me. Not calc-Tyler—hockey Tyler. Senior, defense position, team captain. Six-foot-two of hockey player in a beat-up Canucks hoodie that's seen better days.

"Hey," he says, leaning against the lockers. "Sophia, right?"

"Yeah." I fumble with my physics textbook. "Tyler?"

"That's me." He's got this easy smile, the kind that probably makes half the school swoon. "So, random question. You're in Nakamura's study group, yeah?"

"Usually, yeah."

"Cool. I've been struggling with calc—related rates are literally killing me. Ethan mentioned you're basically a math genius."

I freeze. "Ethan said that?"

"Among other things." Tyler's still smiling, but there's something knowing in his expression. "Anyway, I was wondering if I could crash study group tonight? If that's cool with you guys?"

"It's Jordan's house. You'd have to ask him."

"Already did. He said it's fine. I'm asking if it's cool with you."

There's weight to the question I don't understand. "Sure. Why wouldn't it be?"

"No reason." He pushes off the lockers. "See you tonight then. Thanks, Sophia."

He walks away, and I'm left standing there, confused. My phone buzzes.

**maya:** tyler kim is coming to study group???
**maya:** hockey tyler not calc tyler
**maya:** this is literally the most random thursday ever

She's not wrong.

## Thursday Evening

Study group at Jordan's is usually my favorite part of the week. His basement is perfect—huge sectional couch, good lighting, his mom leaves snacks, and his dad pretends we don't exist. It's been our Thursday thing since October.

Tonight, I arrive exactly on time instead of early. The basement already has voices—Ethan's laugh at something Jordan said, the sound making my chest tight.

"Finally," Jordan says when he sees me. "We're ordering pizza. Preferences?"

"Whatever's fine."

I set up at Jordan's desk instead of the couch. Maya arrives a minute later, followed by Alex and Marcus from the hockey team. Then Tyler Kim shows up with his calc textbook and a family-size bag of Doritos.

"Contribution to the cause," he announces, tossing the bag on the coffee table.

We settle into studying. I'm actually making progress on my physics homework when Tyler groans dramatically from the couch.

"I actually hate related rates. Like, with passion."

"They're not that bad," Ethan says.

"Says the guy who got a 98 on the last test."

"97," Ethan corrects.

"Oh, excuse me. 97. Totally different."

I find myself almost smiling. Tyler's funny in this self-deprecating way that feels genuine.

"The ladder one's killing me," Tyler continues. "Why is the ladder sliding? Who's measuring this? Is this someone's job?"

"It's just an example," I say without thinking.

Tyler looks over. "Okay, but like, can you explain it? Because I've been staring at it for twenty minutes and my brain's melting."

I hesitate. Going over means sitting near the couch. Near Ethan.

"Please?" Tyler adds. "I'll owe you forever. I'll name my firstborn after you."

"That's a weird offer."

"I'm desperate."

Maya kicks my chair. "Just help him, Soph."

I grab my notebook and move to the floor by the coffee table. Tyler slides down next to me, his textbook between us. He smells like hockey gear and whatever body spray teenage boys think is subtle but isn't.

"Okay, so picture this ladder thing," I start. "It's like, twenty feet long or whatever."

"Already lost."

"No, wait. Imagine it's leaning against a wall, but the bottom starts sliding away. They want to know how fast the top is falling when the bottom is fifteen feet from the wall."

"Still confused but keep going."

I draw a diagram, explaining Pythagorean theorem, derivatives, the relationship between the rates. Tyler asks questions—good ones, actually. He's not dumb, just needed someone to walk through it.

"Oh shit," he says suddenly. "That actually makes sense."

"Right?"

"You're literally a lifesaver." He grins, and I notice he has really nice dimples. "Ethan was right—you are a math genius."

I glance at the couch where Ethan's watching us, expression unreadable. Our eyes meet for a second before I look away.

"Just good at explaining, I guess."

We work through a few more problems. Tyler's funny, making jokes about the word problems ("Why are there so many people filling pools at different rates? Is this a thing?"), and I'm actually enjoying myself.

When study group breaks up around nine, Tyler walks out with me.

"Thanks again," he says as we reach my car. "Seriously, you saved my calc grade."

"No problem."

"Hey, so..." He shifts, suddenly less confident. "This is kinda random, but winter formal's coming up. December sixteenth."

My brain short-circuits. "Oh."

"Would you maybe want to go? With me?" He rushes to add, "Like, no pressure. We could just go as friends, have fun. The team usually goes as a group anyway."

Tyler Kim is asking me to winter formal.

Tyler Kim, who's sweet and funny and uncomplicated. Tyler Kim, who has nothing to do with impossible equations and family ultimatums and hearts that beat out of rhythm.

Tyler Kim, who is safe.

"Can I think about it?" I hear myself say.

"Yeah, totally. No rush." He smiles, easy and warm. "Text me whenever. Or tell me at school. Or send a carrier pigeon. I'm flexible."

I laugh despite everything. "I'll let you know."

"Cool. Night, Sophia."

"Night."

I sit in my car for a minute, heating up, when my phone buzzes.

**ethan:** u ok?

I look back at Jordan's house. Through the basement window, I can see figures still moving around.

**me:** yeah why?

**ethan:** tyler asked u to formal

Not a question. A statement.

**me:** yeah

The dots appear and disappear for a solid minute.

**ethan:** cool. hes a good guy

**me:** yeah he seems nice

More dots. Then nothing. Then:

**ethan:** miss talking to u

My heart cracks. I type and delete five responses before settling on:

**me:** i know. im sorry

**ethan:** dont be sorry. just talk to me

**ethan:** whatever it is we can figure it out

**ethan:** sophie please

I turn off my phone and drive home, tears blurring the streetlights into stars.

## Friday After School

I find Tyler at his locker after last period. The hallway's chaos—everyone excited about the weekend, about the game tonight, about Friday freedom.

"Hey," I say.

He turns, face lighting up. "Sophia! What's up?"

"About winter formal."

"Oh." He actually looks nervous, which is weirdly endearing on someone built like a truck. "What're you thinking?"

"I'm thinking yes. If that's still—if you still want to."

His whole face transforms. "Yeah? Really? That's—yeah, absolutely."

"But just, um, to be clear—I'm not really looking for anything serious right now. With college apps and badminton and everything."

"Totally get it. No pressure. We'll just have fun."

We figure out he'll text me about details, colors, all that stuff I've seen in movies but never actually done. When I turn to leave, he calls after me.

"Hey, you coming to the game tonight?"

"I don't usually—"

"You should. We're playing Oak Park. It'll be good." He grins. "Plus, now you're contractually obligated to support your formal date."

"Is that how it works?"

"Definitely. Page 47 of the formal date handbook."

I find myself actually smiling. "Maybe I'll come."

"Bring Maya. Jordan's playing tonight too."

As I walk away, my phone explodes.

**maya:** TYLER KIM ASKED U TO FORMAL?????
**maya:** THE HOCKEY CAPTAIN TYLER?????
**maya:** SENIOR TYLER????
**maya:** SOPHIA CHEN WHAT IS HAPPENING

**me:** its not a big deal

**maya:** ITS LITERALLY THE BIGGEST DEAL
**maya:** jordan heard from alex who heard from marcus
**maya:** the hockey gossip network is FAST

**me:** its just a dance

**maya:** WITH THE HOCKEY CAPTAIN
**maya:** wait are u ok with this?
**maya:** like actually ok?

**me:** yeah i think itll be fun

What I don't type: I'm using Tyler Kim as armor against feelings I can't afford. I'm the worst person alive.

**maya:** WE NEED DRESSES
**maya:** OMG WE NEED TO GO SHOPPING
**maya:** TOMORROW

**me:** ok ok calm down

**maya:** NEVER
**maya:** also ur coming to the game tonight
**maya:** not optional
**maya:** tyler will be looking for u

She's not wrong.

## Friday Night

The arena is packed, that intense hockey crowd energy that makes you understand why people get so invested in sports. Maya and I find seats five rows up, close enough to see everything.

"Forgot how loud hockey crowds are," Maya says, already destroying popcorn.

The teams come out for warmups. Ethan's number 19, skating with that effortless grace that made him impossible to catch even when we were nine. He looks like he belongs here, like the ice is where he makes sense.

Tyler's number 7, bigger than Ethan but surprisingly fast. He waves when he spots us—just a quick stick raise that makes the girls in front of us turn around.

"Did Tyler Kim just wave at you?" one asks.

"They're going to formal together," Maya announces, because subtlety isn't her thing.

Instant chatter. Apparently Tyler's been single all semester. I learn his ex goes to McGill now, that he's already got a full ride to UBC, that half the team has been trying to set him up.

The game starts, and I remember why I don't usually come to these. Hockey's so fast, so violent. Every time someone crashes into the boards, I flinch.

But watching Ethan play... it's like watching him become who he's supposed to be. He doesn't just play hockey—he conducts it, seeing plays before they happen, being exactly where he needs to be.

Oak Park scores first. Our section groans. Then Tyler makes this incredible defensive play, using his whole body to block what would definitely have been a goal.

"Jesus," Maya mutters. "Remind me not to piss him off."

Ethan's line scores to tie it up. The crowd goes insane. He set up the play—this perfect pass that nobody saw coming except him.

Between periods, I check my phone. Three messages from Jordan about how we're definitely going to win, one from my mom asking when I'll be home, and:

**ethan:** u came

**me:** maya dragged me

**ethan:** still. thanks

I don't know what to say to that, so I don't respond.

Third period, we're up 3-2 with two minutes left. Oak Park pulls their goalie, desperate for the tie. Six on five. The tension's unbearable.

Ethan steals the puck. Empty net. He could shoot from anywhere, secure the win. Instead, he passes to Tyler, who's in better position. Tyler scores.

The arena explodes. Maya's hugging me even though neither of us really cares about hockey. Tyler's getting mobbed by the team, but I see him point at Ethan—making sure everyone knows who set it up.

After the game, we wait outside the locker room with other friends and family. Tyler comes out first, hair still wet, looking tired but happy.

"You came!" He seems genuinely surprised.

"Good game. That empty-netter was perfect."

"That was all Ethan. Perfect pass." He shifts his bag. "Hey, bunch of us are hitting Danny's. You guys want to come?"

Maya immediately says yes. I'm about to make an excuse when Ethan emerges from the locker room.

Our eyes meet across the crowded hallway. He's still in his underarmor shirt, hair damp, and for a second I forget how to breathe. Then Tyler's saying something about pancakes and the moment breaks.

At Danny's, I end up in a booth with Tyler on one side, Maya and Jordan across from us. Ethan's two tables over with some other guys from the team, but I can feel him there, like gravity.

"So," Tyler says, stealing one of my fries even though he ordered his own. "Formal. I need education. What color dress?"

"I don't know yet."

"Don't guys usually wait to hear so they can match?" Jordan asks.

"Do we match? Is that required?" Tyler looks genuinely concerned.

"We don't have to match," I assure him.

"But we can if you want. I clean up pretty good."

Maya kicks me under the table, giving me a look that says *he's trying so hard*. And he is. Tyler's sweet and funny and uncomplicated, and I should be happy that this nice, attractive senior wants to take me to a dance.

Instead, I'm hyperaware that Ethan's three tables away, laughing at something Marcus said, and I know that laugh, know the way his eyes crinkle, know exactly how his shoulders move when he's really amused.

"Earth to Sophia," Tyler says gently.

"Sorry, what?"

"I asked if you have a curfew. Don't want to get you in trouble."

"Oh. Midnight."

"Cool. I'll make sure you turn into a pumpkin on time."

He's trying so hard to make me comfortable, to be easy and fun and pressure-free. He deserves better than being someone's safety choice.

When we leave, he walks me to my car again.

"Thanks for coming tonight. To the game, I mean. It was cool having you there."

"Thanks for inviting me."

"So I'll text you about formal stuff? We can figure out the logistics."

"Sounds good."

He hesitates, then: "Sophia, can I ask you something?"

My stomach drops. "Sure."

"Is there—I mean, you and Ethan. You guys are friends, right?"

The word tastes like a lie. "Yeah. We're friends."

Tyler nods slowly. "Cool. Just checking. I don't want to cause any drama or whatever."

"No drama. Promise."

Another lie. Everything about this is drama, just the quiet kind that happens in your chest where nobody can see it.

"Okay. Well, see you Monday."

"See you Monday."

I drive home through empty streets, past houses starting to put up Christmas lights, past The Forks where everything started, past the life I thought I was going to have.

My phone buzzes at a red light.

**ethan:** we need to talk

**me:** i know

**ethan:** tomorrow?

**me:** cant tomorrow. shopping with maya

**ethan:** sunday then

**ethan:** please sophie

That 'please' breaks something in me.

**me:** ok. sunday

**ethan:** the forks? 2pm?

Our place. Where we found each other again, where everything got complicated, where I'm going to have to tell him I can't do this.

**me:** ok

**ethan:** thank u

I drive the rest of the way home in silence, no music, no podcast, just the sound of my tires on frozen pavement and my heart beating out of rhythm.

Sunday. I have two days to figure out how to explain that I'm walking away because I love him too much to ruin his life.

Two days to solve an impossible equation.

Two days to learn how to lie to the person who knows me better than anyone.

No pressure.
