# CHAPTER 1: THE SETUP

## The Decision

The problem with physics is that it's supposed to make sense. You input the correct variables, apply the correct equations, and you get the correct answer. It's clean. Predictable. Safe.

Love doesn't work that way.

I'm lying in bed at 2 AM, my physics notebook open in front of me, trying to work through an equation that has nothing to do with homework and everything to do with the impossible choice Jordan just handed me three hours ago.

*They're going to separate you. And they're going to make it look like it's for his own good.*

My pen moves across the paper, scratching out variables:

**Variable E** = Ethan's future (hockey career, family expectations, prep school)

**Variable S** = Me (our friendship, whatever this feeling is, the way my heart stops when he smiles)

**Variable T** = Time (he leaves December 28th, three weeks from now)

**Variable P** = Price Family (money, power, legal maneuvering, threats)

I draw the equation:

**E + S = ?**

The answer should be simple. But every way I work it, someone loses.

If E + S = together → P intervenes → E loses everything

If E - S = apart → E's future secure → S loses everything → E loses S

There's no solution where we both win.

Outside my window, Winnipeg is settling into real winter. The kind of cold that bites, that makes your breath visible, that turns the world sharp and brittle. November sliding into December. The trees are bare, the grass buried under snow, and everything feels like it's holding its breath waiting for something to break.

My phone buzzes. Ethan.

**ETHAN:** You okay? Jordan said you left in a hurry.

My thumb hovers over the keyboard. Three weeks. That's all we have before his parents ship him off to Michigan, to some prep school where NHL scouts watch every practice and his father's plan for his life becomes inescapable.

Three weeks where I could be selfish. Where I could keep pretending we're just friends who look at each other too long, who text until 3 AM, who've memorized the way the other person breathes.

Or three weeks where I could do the right thing.

I type: **I'm fine. Just tired. Talk tomorrow?**

The dots appear immediately. Disappear. Appear again.

**ETHAN:** Sure. Sleep well, Watson.

I stare at that nickname—the one he's called me since we were nine and he decided I was Sherlock's better half. The one that used to mean we were partners in everything.

The one I'm about to make mean nothing.

I close my notebook, the equation unsolved, and turn off my light. But I don't sleep. I lie there in the dark, listening to winter wind against my window, and make the hardest decision of my life.

Tomorrow, I start walking away.

## Monday Morning

The thing about avoiding someone you see every day is that it requires constant vigilance. Ethan and I have synchronized schedules—AP Physics together, lunch with the same group, study sessions at Jordan's. We exist in overlapping orbits, planets circling the same sun.

Changing that orbit requires force. Deliberate, painful force.

Monday morning I take the long route to my locker, the one that avoids his hallway. I time my arrival to Physics so I slip in right as the bell rings, no chance for our usual pre-class conversation. I take a seat in the back instead of next to him.

He notices immediately. Of course he does.

When Mr. Hendricks drones on about momentum and force vectors, Ethan keeps glancing back. I feel his eyes on me like a physical weight, but I don't look up. I focus on my notes with laser precision, writing down every word like it's the most important lecture I've ever attended.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. Once, twice, three times.

I don't check it.

After class, I'm the first one out the door, mumbling something about needing to talk to Coach Martinez about badminton practice. It's not even a lie—I do need to talk to her. Just not right this second.

But it gets me out of the hallway before Ethan can catch up.

At lunch, I sit between Maya and Jordan, putting them between me and the empty chair that's always been Ethan's. When he arrives, tray in hand, that confused-hurt look still on his face, I'm deep in conversation with Maya about our upcoming match against St. Paul's.

"Soph," Ethan says, standing at the edge of our table.

"Hey." I keep my voice bright, friendly, distant. "How's your turkey sandwich?"

He blinks. "What?"

"Your lunch. Is it good?"

"I... haven't sat down yet."

"Oh. Right." I turn back to Maya. "So you were saying about their singles player?"

There's a long moment where I can feel Ethan just standing there, trying to figure out what's happening. Then he takes the chair across from me instead of next to me. The table feels suddenly huge.

Jordan shoots me a look that says *what are you doing?* I give him one back that says *what you told me to*.

Except Jordan didn't tell me to do this. He told me Ethan's parents were separating us. He didn't say I should help them do it.

That's all me.

"So," Tyler Chen says—different Tyler, not hockey Tyler, this is Tyler-who's-in-our-study-group—"did everyone finish the calculus homework? Because that last problem destroyed me."

The conversation shifts to derivatives and limits and the test on Friday. Safe, academic, normal. Ethan contributes like nothing's wrong, but I catch him watching me three times. Each time I look away first.

By the end of lunch, my stomach hurts and I haven't eaten anything.

"Okay," Maya says as we're walking to our next class. "What the actual hell?"

"What?"

"Don't 'what' me. You're being weird with Ethan."

"I'm not being weird."

"Sophia. You sat between me and Jordan like we're human shields. You didn't look at him once during lunch. And I'm pretty sure you just accidentally agreed to help me organize a bake sale, which you hate doing."

I stop walking. "I did?"

"See? Weird." Maya crosses her arms, her braids swinging as she faces me fully. "What happened? Did you guys fight?"

"No."

"Did he do something?"

"No. Maya, it's fine."

"It's clearly not fine. You look like you're about to cry, and he looks like someone killed his puppy. So what's going on?"

I want to tell her. Maya's been my best friend since I moved here sophomore year—she's the one who made Winnipeg feel less like exile and more like home. She knows about the childhood friendship with Ethan, the reunion, the slowly building something-more that neither of us has named yet.

But I can't explain that I'm doing this to protect him without explaining what I'm protecting him from. And Jordan told me about Ethan's parents in confidence.

"His parents want him to focus on hockey," I say finally. It's not a lie. "And I'm a distraction."

Maya's expression shifts from confused to outraged. "They said that?"

"Not to me. But yeah, basically."

"So you're just... what? Ghosting him?"

"I'm not ghosting him. I'm giving him space."

"Space he doesn't want."

"Space he needs."

Maya looks at me for a long moment, and I can see her trying to decide whether to push. Finally, she sighs. "Okay. But Soph? This seems like one of those things where you're overthinking it."

"Maybe."

"And you look miserable."

"I'm fine."

"Right. And I'm the Queen of England." She loops her arm through mine anyway. "Come on. We're going to be late to History, and Mr. Peterson's already mad at me for that essay."

We walk to class, but I'm only half listening to Maya's story about her essay on the French Revolution. The other half of me is trying not to think about the hurt confusion on Ethan's face at lunch.

Three weeks, I remind myself. Just three weeks, and he'll be gone anyway. This way it hurts less.

The problem is, it already hurts so much I can barely breathe.

---

## Wednesday Evening

Study group at Jordan's house has been a tradition since October—the six of us sprawled across his basement, working through homework with varying levels of success and significant amounts of snacks.

Tonight feels different.

I arrive exactly on time instead of early. Usually, Ethan and I are the first ones there, claiming the good spots on Jordan's massive sectional, setting up our books. We have a system: I help him with physics, he helps me with calc (even though I'm good at it, he's better), we both pretend we're studying while mostly just talking.

But tonight, when I come downstairs, Ethan's already there. So is Alex Wei and Marcus Johnson, two of Ethan's teammates who sometimes join us. They're arguing about a play from last night's game, some defensive formation that Marcus thinks would have prevented a goal.

"Soph," Jordan says, looking up from where he's setting out pizza boxes. "Hey. You want pepperoni or veggie?"

"Veggie's good."

I take a seat at Jordan's desk instead of the couch, pulling out my physics textbook. Maya arrives a minute later, raising her eyebrows at my seating choice but not commenting.

Then Ethan's phone rings.

"Yeah?" He answers, then grins. "Yo, Tyler. No, we're at Jordan's. Study group." A pause. "Dude, you literally have the same calc test. Get over here." Another pause, and he glances at me—just a flicker. "Yeah. See you in ten."

He hangs up. "Tyler Kim's coming. That cool?"

Jordan shrugs. "The more the merrier. Though we're going to run out of pizza."

I keep my eyes on my textbook. Tyler Kim is a senior, defense position, hockey team captain. I've seen him around—tall, Korean-Canadian, always wearing this beat-up Canucks hoodie. He's friends with Ethan, part of that hockey circle that seems to exist in its own ecosystem.

I've never really talked to him.

When he arrives ten minutes later, he's got the calc textbook under one arm and a bag of chips in the other. "Nakamura, your basement is still the best place in Winnipeg."

"It's the ping pong table," Jordan says. "Adds class."

"It's the fact that your parents pretend we don't exist and let us work in peace," Alex corrects.

Tyler laughs, then notices the group. His eyes land on me for a second before Ethan stands up.

"Ty, this is Sophia Chen, Maya Foster, and you know everyone else."

"Hey," Tyler says. He's got an easy smile, the kind that makes you want to smile back. "You're the badminton player, right? Ethan mentioned you're going to nationals."

"Hopefully," I say. "If I don't choke at regionals."

"She's not going to choke," Maya adds. "She's just annoyingly humble about being incredible."

"Sounds familiar." Tyler elbows Ethan, who rolls his eyes.

We settle into studying, the group fragmenting into smaller conversations. Alex and Marcus are working on English, analyzing some Hemingway story they clearly didn't read. Maya and Jordan are doing History together—or rather, Jordan's explaining the fall of Rome while Maya doodles in her notebook.

That leaves me at the desk, Ethan on one side of the couch, and Tyler sprawled on the other end.

"Okay," Tyler says after twenty minutes of silent calc work. "I officially hate related rates."

"Welcome to calculus," Ethan mutters.

"No, related rates are cool," I say without thinking. "They're just—you have to visualize what's actually happening."

Tyler looks up. "I'm visualizing hating math."

Despite everything, I almost laugh. "Here." I get up, bringing my notebook over, and sit on the floor in front of the coffee table. "Show me the problem."

Tyler slides down next to me, pointing to his textbook. "This one. Something about a ladder sliding down a wall."

"Okay. So picture it. There's a ladder, right? Twenty feet long." I draw a quick diagram. "It's leaning against a wall, but the bottom is sliding away. They want to know how fast the top is sliding down when the bottom is fifteen feet from the wall."

"Which makes no sense because who's measuring that?"

"Weird math people?"

"Fair." Tyler grins, and I realize he's got dimples. "Okay, so. Ladder. Wall. Pythagorean theorem?"

"Exactly. Because you've got a right triangle. The ladder's the hypotenuse, the wall and ground are the legs."

We work through the problem together, Tyler asking good questions, actually getting it by the end. When he finally writes down the answer, he looks genuinely excited.

"That's actually cool."

"Related rates are cool," I repeat.

"You sound like Ethan. He gets all enthusiastic about math too."

I glance over at the couch, where Ethan's watching us. When our eyes meet, he looks away quickly, back to his own homework.

My chest tightens.

"Hey," Tyler says, quieter. "Thanks. I've been stuck on this for like an hour."

"No problem. Math's easier when you can see it."

We keep working, Tyler asking me about a few more problems, me explaining limits and derivatives. He's quick, just needed someone to talk it through with. And it's... nice. Easy. No weight behind it, no history, no impossible equations.

When study group breaks up around nine, Tyler walks out at the same time as me.

"You heading home?" he asks.

"Yeah. My car's parked down the street."

"I'll walk you."

It's only two houses down, but the temperature has dropped into the negative numbers, that sharp Winnipeg cold that makes your face hurt. The sky is clear, stars brilliant, the kind of night where sound carries differently.

"So," Tyler says as we reach my car. "This is random, but there's this winter formal thing. December sixteenth. You probably know about it already."

I did know. Maya's been talking about it for weeks, trying to decide if she wants to ask Jordan or wait for him to ask her—a complex negotiation I've been trying to stay out of.

"It's not really my thing," I say carefully.

"Yeah, I get that. It's kind of cheesy. But it's also fun, and the hockey team usually goes as a group, and I thought..." He pauses, and even in the dim streetlight, I can see he's a little nervous. "Would you want to go? With me?"

I stare at him.

Tyler Kim is asking me to winter formal.

Tyler Kim, who's a senior, who's sweet and funny, who's going to UBC next year on a hockey scholarship. Tyler Kim, who has absolutely nothing to do with the mess that is my history with Ethan.

Tyler Kim, who is safe.

"You don't have to decide now," he adds quickly. "I know it's kind of far away still. But I wanted to ask before, you know, someone else did."

Someone else. Like Ethan, who definitely won't ask me now, who's leaving for Michigan in three weeks anyway, whose parents have made it clear I'm a problem they intend to solve.

"Can I think about it?" I hear myself say.

"Yeah, totally. No pressure." Tyler smiles, easy and warm. "Hey, if you ever need calc help again, or want to explain more cool math things, I'm around."

"Thanks, Tyler."

"Night, Sophia."

He walks back toward Jordan's house, probably to catch a ride with Ethan. I get in my car, turn on the heat, and sit there for a moment while the engine warms up.

My phone buzzes.

**ETHAN:** You okay?

I look back at Jordan's house. Through the basement window, I can see figures moving—probably everyone still leaving. Ethan texted from inside while Tyler was asking me to a dance.

**ME:** Yeah. Just cold.

**ETHAN:** Want to talk?

I type and delete three different responses. Finally: **It's late. Tomorrow?**

The dots appear, disappear, appear again.

**ETHAN:** Sure.

I drive home through empty streets, past houses with Christmas lights starting to appear, past the dark sprawl of The Forks where we used to meet as kids. Past everything that used to be ours.

Tomorrow I'll tell Maya that Tyler Kim asked me to winter formal.

I won't tell her that I'm already planning to say yes.

Or that the whole drive home, I'm trying not to cry.

---

## Friday After School

I find Tyler at his locker after last period. The hallway is chaos—everyone excited about the weekend, about the hockey game tonight, about Friday freedom. He's shoving textbooks into his backpack when I walk up.

"Hey," I say.

He turns, sees me, and his smile is immediate. "Hey. What's up?"

"About winter formal."

"Oh. Right." He looks suddenly nervous again, which is kind of endearing on someone who's six-foot-two and built like a hockey player. "What are you thinking?"

"I'm thinking yes. If the offer's still open."

His whole face lights up. "Yeah? That's—yeah. Definitely still open. That's great."

"Just to be clear," I add, because I need to be fair, "I'm not really looking for anything serious right now. With college apps and badminton and everything."

"No, totally. I get it. We can just go as friends, have fun. No pressure."

Friends. That should feel like a relief.

So why does it feel like I'm lying?

"Cool," I say. "Then yeah. I'd like to go."

"Awesome. I'll text you about details and stuff. Color coordination, I guess? I have no idea how this works."

"Neither do I."

We both laugh, and it's genuinely nice. Easy. Tyler's easy in a way that feels like breathing.

"You coming to the game tonight?" he asks.

"I don't usually."

"You should. We're playing Central. It's going to be intense." He grins. "Plus, now you have to support your formal date, right?"

"Is that how it works?"

"I'm pretty sure that's in the rules somewhere."

I find myself smiling despite everything. "Okay. Maybe I'll come."

"Bring your friend Maya. She's cool."

"I'll ask her."

We say goodbye, and I head to my own locker, feeling... something. Not quite relief, not quite happiness. More like I've made a choice and now I have to live with it.

My phone buzzes the second I open my locker.

**MAYA:** TYLER KIM ASKED YOU TO FORMAL?!?!

I look around. Maya's standing at the end of the hallway, phone in hand, eyes wide.

I text back: **How did you hear that?**

**MAYA:** Jordan heard from Alex who heard from Tyler who's apparently VERY EXCITED

**ME:** It's not a big deal

**MAYA:** You're going to winter formal with a SENIOR HOCKEY CAPTAIN

**MAYA:** It's at least a medium-sized deal

**MAYA:** Wait are you okay with this?

I type: **Yeah. I think it'll be fun.**

What I don't type: I'm using Tyler Kim as a human shield between me and Ethan Price, and I'm a terrible person for it.

**MAYA:** Okay but we need to dress shop ASAP

**MAYA:** Also you're coming to the game tonight

**ME:** Tyler mentioned that

**MAYA:** Ooh TYLER now is it?

**ME:** Stop

**MAYA:** Never

**MAYA:** This is the most exciting thing to happen since Jordan accidentally dyed his hair green

I'm laughing when I close my locker and nearly run directly into Ethan.

"Sorry," he says, stepping back.

"No, my fault." I clutch my phone, suddenly aware that I'm standing here texting about Tyler asking me to a dance while talking to the person I actually want to be talking to.

"You heading out?" he asks.

"Yeah. You?"

"Practice in an hour. Game at seven."

"Right. Tyler mentioned."

Something flickers across Ethan's face. "He told you?"

"He invited me, actually."

"Oh. That's—cool. You should come."

We stand there in the emptying hallway, and I'm suddenly desperate to say something real. To tell him I'm sorry for the distance this week, that I'm trying to do the right thing even though it feels completely wrong, that I miss our conversations and the way he explains things and the nickname Watson and everything.

But I don't say any of that.

Instead: "Good luck tonight."

"Thanks." He adjusts his backpack. "Hey, Soph?"

My heart does something complicated. "Yeah?"

"Are we okay? Because you've been kind of distant this week, and I don't—I don't know if I did something wrong."

Yes, I should say. We're fine. I'm just busy.

But I've never been good at lying to Ethan.

"You didn't do anything wrong," I say quietly. "I'm just... trying to figure some things out."

"Anything I can help with?"

Everything. Nothing.

"I don't think so. But thank you."

He nods slowly, and I can see him trying to decide whether to push or let it go. Finally: "Okay. But if you want to talk, I'm here. You know that, right?"

"I know."

We say goodbye, and I walk out to the parking lot, where Maya's already waiting by my car.

"So," she says as I unlock the doors. "We're going shopping for formal dresses, and then we're going to a hockey game. This is officially the most social you've been all semester."

"It's one dress and one game."

"For you, that's huge." She slides into the passenger seat. "Also, are you going to tell me what's actually going on with you and Ethan?"

"Nothing's going on."

"Sophia. I've seen nothing. This is something pretending to be nothing."

I start the car, pulling out of the parking lot. "His parents want him focused on hockey. I'm respecting that."

"By dating his teammate?"

"I'm not dating Tyler. I'm going to one dance."

"Uh-huh." Maya's quiet for a moment. "You know you're allowed to want things, right? You don't always have to be noble and self-sacrificing."

"I'm not being noble."

"You're being something. I just can't figure out what."

I drive toward the mall, where we're apparently going dress shopping for a dance I don't want to go to with a guy who deserves better than being a placeholder for someone else.

My phone buzzes at a red light.

**ETHAN:** See you tonight?

I stare at the message while Maya talks about dress styles and colors. Three weeks, I remind myself. Three weeks and he's gone anyway. This way is easier.

**ME:** Yeah. See you tonight.

The light turns green, and I drive forward, ignoring the feeling that I'm moving in exactly the wrong direction.

## Friday Night Game

Beavers Arena is loud even before the game starts—that particular hockey crowd noise, all excitement and cold air and the smell of popcorn mixed with ice. Maya and I find seats five rows up from the glass, close enough to see everything, far enough to not be in the splash zone when players hit the boards.

"I forgot how intense hockey crowds are," Maya says, already eating popcorn even though we just had dinner. "Everyone's so invested."

"It's kind of terrifying."

"Says the girl who plays a sport where you hit things with rackets at ninety miles per hour."

"That's different. Badminton crowds are quiet. Respectful."

"Boring, you mean."

"Focused."

The teams come out for warm-ups, and I spot Ethan immediately—number 19, navy and gold jersey, skating with that easy confidence that makes it look effortless. He's always been good on ice, even as a kid. But now, watching him warm up with his team, practicing shots and passing drills, he looks like he belongs here in a way that's almost scary.

Three weeks, and he'll be at a prep school where NHL scouts watch every practice.

This is his future. Not study groups and math help and late-night texts with a girl who plays badminton.

"There's Tyler," Maya points out. Number 7, defense position, bigger than Ethan but moving with surprising speed for his size. He waves when he sees us, a quick stick raise that makes some of the other hockey girlfriends in our section look over curiously.

"Oh my god," one of them says—a blonde girl I recognize from AP Lit. "Did Tyler Kim just wave at you guys?"

"He invited Sophia to winter formal," Maya announces, because subtlety is not her strong suit.

The girls immediately start talking—apparently Tyler's been single all semester and there was speculation about whether he'd ask someone or go with the team. I'm getting details about his last girlfriend (graduated last year, goes to McGill now, they broke up because of distance) when the game starts and everyone's attention shifts.

Hockey is fast. That's the first thing you notice if you're not used to it—how quickly everything happens, how the puck moves, how players go from one end to the other in seconds. The crowd is deafening, everyone on their feet when either team gets close to scoring.

Central's good. They score first, eight minutes into the first period, and our section groans in unison.

"Come on, Beavers!" someone shouts behind us.

Ethan's line is on ice when we tie it up, and even though he doesn't score, I watch him set up the play—a quick pass to Alex that catches Central's defense off guard. The student section goes wild.

"He's really good," Maya observes.

"Yeah."

"Like really good. Is he getting recruited?"

"I think so. A few schools."

"And his parents want him at prep school?"

"Better exposure."

Maya makes a face. "That sounds like a lot of pressure."

I don't answer because the second period is starting and Tyler's line is on ice. He plays defense the way you'd expect from someone his size—a wall that people can't get through. When a Central forward tries to blow past him, Tyler knocks him into the boards so hard I wince.

"Wow," Maya says. "Remind me not to make him mad."

But Tyler's not playing angry. He's playing controlled, smart, reading the ice and positioning himself where he needs to be. When he blocks a shot that was definitely going in, using his body as a shield, the crowd erupts.

Between the second and third periods, I check my phone.

**JORDAN:** You're at the game???

**ME:** Maya dragged me

**JORDAN:** Sure she did

**JORDAN:** Tyler's playing great btw

**JORDAN:** Ethan's been looking at the stands a lot though

**JORDAN:** Just saying

I don't respond to that. I put my phone away and focus on the ice.

The third period is tied 2-2, both teams exhausted, playing desperate. With three minutes left, Central scores on a power play, and our section deflates.

"Come on," Maya mutters. "There's still time."

Two minutes left. Ethan's line takes the ice, and I can see the tension in the way he skates—aggressive, hungry. Central's playing defensive, trying to run out the clock.

One minute.

Ethan gets the puck, passes to Marcus, who passes it back. He's racing down ice, Central's defense converging. Thirty seconds. He should pass, should set up a play, but instead he sees an opening and takes it—a shot from an angle that shouldn't work but somehow does, the puck sailing past Central's goalie into the net.

The arena explodes.

I'm on my feet with everyone else, screaming, watching Ethan get mobbed by his team. The crowd is chanting and the buzzer sounds and it's going to overtime.

"Oh my god," Maya yells over the noise. "Did you see that?"

I saw it. I'm still seeing it—Ethan pumping his fist, his teammates piling on him, the pure joy on his face. This is what he's meant to do. This is his path.

And I'm a detour he can't afford.

Overtime is five minutes of sudden death—first goal wins. The crowd is on its feet the entire time, the tension unbearable. Both teams are skating hard, both goalies playing out of their minds.

Three minutes in, Tyler steals the puck from a Central forward, passes it up to Alex, who passes it to Ethan. He's skating so fast it looks like flying, and when he takes the shot—

Goal.

Game over.

Beavers win 4-3.

The arena is chaos. The team is piling on Ethan again, the crowd is going insane, and Maya is hugging me even though we barely care about hockey.

"That was incredible!" she shouts.

It was. It really, really was.

---

## After

We wait outside the locker room with a bunch of other people—girlfriends, friends, parents waiting to congratulate their kids. The team comes out gradually, still high on the win, everyone talking over each other.

Tyler emerges fifteen minutes in, hair still wet from the shower, looking tired and happy.

"You came," he says when he sees me.

"Good game. That block in the second period was amazing."

"Thanks." He grins. "Did you see Price's overtime goal? Kid's insane."

"It was pretty great."

"Pretty great? He's going to be watching that replay for a week." Tyler shifts his hockey bag. "Hey, you guys want to grab food? A bunch of us are going to Danny's."

Danny's is a diner near school that's open late, where hockey players apparently go after games to eat their weight in pancakes.

"I'm in," Maya says immediately.

I hesitate. "I don't want to intrude on team stuff."

"You're not intruding. I'm inviting you." Tyler's smile is genuine. "Come on. You can explain more related rates problems while I eat."

"That's your idea of fun?"

"Don't judge my hobbies."

I laugh despite myself. "Okay. Sure."

We head to Danny's in separate cars, Maya in mine, already texting Jordan to meet us there.

"Tyler's nice," she observes as we drive.

"Yeah."

"And cute."

"I guess."

"You guess? Sophia, the boy is objectively attractive."

"Sure. Objectively."

Maya looks at me sideways. "You know what I think?"

"I'm sure you're going to tell me."

"I think you're going to winter formal with a nice, cute, objectively attractive guy who clearly likes you. And I think you're going to have a good time. And I think maybe that's exactly what you need right now."

Maybe she's right. Maybe Tyler is what I need—something simple and easy and uncomplicated. Something that doesn't come with impossible equations and prep school deadlines and parents who view me as an obstacle.

Maybe this is the right choice.

So why does it feel like I'm solving for the wrong variable?

Danny's is packed when we arrive—hockey team taking up four booths, everyone still celebrating. Tyler waves us over to where he's saved seats, and I slide in next to him while Maya sits across with Jordan, who arrived five minutes before us.

"Chen!" Marcus calls from the next booth. "Incredible game, right?"

"It was amazing," I agree.

Ethan's at the far end of our booth section, surrounded by teammates congratulating him on the overtime goal. He's smiling, accepting fist bumps and shoulder shoves, but when his eyes find mine across the crowd, his smile falters for just a second.

I look away first. Again.

The waitress takes our order—Tyler gets a burger and fries, I get soup because it's freezing and I'm not actually that hungry. The table is loud, everyone recapping plays and analyzing what went right.

"That pass you made in the second," Alex tells Tyler, "that was perfect positioning."

"Price is the one who made something of it."

"Team effort," someone else adds.

Tyler turns to me. "So, winter formal. I have no idea what I'm doing. Do I need to get you flowers or something?"

"I don't know. I've never done this before."

"Same. We can figure it out together."

Jordan's watching us from across the table, his expression unreadable. Maya kicks him under the table—I see her do it—and he blinks and looks away.

The food arrives, and Tyler immediately steals one of my fries even though he has his own.

"Hey!"

"Sharing is caring." He grins. "Plus, you got soup. That's not real food after a hockey game."

"Some of us don't burn three thousand calories a night."

"You play badminton. That's basically constant cardio."

"It's really not the same."

We're debating the relative athletic merits of different sports when someone slides into the booth next to me—the seat I didn't realize was empty.

Ethan.

"Move over," he tells Tyler. "I'm not sitting in the other booth listening to Marcus talk about his dating life."

Tyler laughs and shifts, which means I'm now sitting between them—Tyler on one side, Ethan on the other, both of them close enough that I'm hyperaware of the space.

"Great game, man," Tyler says.

"Thanks. You played solid defense."

"Just doing my job."

They start talking hockey strategy—something about neutral zone positioning and offensive pressure. I focus on my soup, trying to ignore the fact that I can feel the warmth from both of them, that I'm acutely aware of every time Ethan shifts or Tyler gestures.

"Soph," Ethan says suddenly. "You good?"

I look up. "Yeah. Why?"

"You've been stirring that soup for like five minutes without eating any."

He's right. I put my spoon down. "Just thinking."

"About?"

Everything. Nothing. How three weeks ago this was simple and now it's the most complicated thing in my life.

"Physics," I lie. "I'm stuck on a problem."

"Which one?"

Don't do this. Don't engage. Don't fall back into the easy pattern of us talking about homework and math and everything.

"It's fine. I'll figure it out."

Ethan's quiet for a moment, then: "You know you can still ask me for help, right? Just because you're going to formal with Tyler doesn't mean we can't—"

"I know," I interrupt. "I know. Thanks."

The conversation moves on, but I feel Ethan watching me for the rest of the meal. Tyler's telling a story about some prank the team played on their coach, and everyone's laughing, but I'm only half listening.

When we leave, Tyler walks me to my car again.

"Thanks for coming tonight," he says. "It was fun having you there."

"Thanks for inviting me."

"So, formal. I'll text you next week? We can figure out details."

"Sounds good."

He hesitates, then: "Hey, can I ask you something?"

My stomach drops. "Sure."

"Is there... I don't want to assume anything, but is there something between you and Price? Because if there is, that's cool, I just—I don't want to step on anyone's toes."

I should tell him the truth. That yes, there's something between me and Ethan—something unfinished and complicated and probably impossible. That I'm saying yes to formal because I'm trying to walk away from that something before it destroys both of us.

But Tyler's nice. Tyler's safe. Tyler is asking me to a dance, not asking me to upend my entire life.

"We're friends," I say. "Just friends."

Tyler studies me for a second, and I have the uncomfortable feeling that he doesn't quite believe me. But he nods anyway. "Okay. Cool. Well, I'll see you Monday."

"See you Monday."

I drive Maya home first, then head to my own house. It's almost midnight, the streets empty, the temperature dropping into the negative twenties. My phone buzzes at a stoplight.

**ETHAN:** You left without saying goodbye

I stare at the text. The light turns green. Someone honks behind me.

**ME:** Sorry. Didn't want to interrupt your celebration

**ETHAN:** You wouldn't have been interrupting

**ETHAN:** Can we talk? Actually talk?

**ME:** About what?

**ETHAN:** Whatever's going on. Because something's going on, Sophie. And I don't understand what it is.

The light ahead turns red. I sit there in my car, in the freezing Winnipeg night, trying to figure out what to say.

Finally: **Not tonight. I'm tired. Tomorrow?**

The response is immediate: **Tomorrow. Promise?**

**ME:** Promise.

I put my phone down and drive the rest of the way home, that word echoing: promise, promise, promise.

I'm making a lot of promises I'm not sure I can keep.

When I get home, I go straight to my room and open my physics notebook, finding the equation I started days ago.

**E + S = ?**

I pick up my pen and write the answer I've been avoiding:

**E + S = impossible**

Then I close the notebook and turn off my light.

Tomorrow I'll talk to Ethan. I'll explain that I'm trying to do the right thing, that his future is more important than whatever this is between us, that three weeks isn't enough time to make this work anyway.

Tomorrow I'll be strong.

Tonight, I let myself cry into my pillow and wish that physics had equations for heartbreak.
