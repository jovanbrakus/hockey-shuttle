# CHAPTER 2: THE WRONG EQUATION

## First Date

Saturday afternoon, December 2nd, and I'm standing in front of my closet trying to figure out what you wear on a date you don't actually want to go on.

"The blue sweater," Maya says from where she's sprawled on my bed, acting as fashion consultant even though I didn't ask for one. "It makes your eyes look less terrified."

"I'm not terrified."

"Sophia. You've changed outfits four times. For coffee."

She's right. I'm being ridiculous. It's just coffee with Tyler, who's nice and easy to talk to and definitely doesn't deserve the weirdness I'm bringing to this.

I pull on the blue sweater. "Better?"

"Much. Now breathe."

I breathe.

"Now put on actual pants instead of those physics-homework-at-midnight joggers."

"They're comfortable."

"They're a cry for help."

Ten minutes later, I'm in jeans and the blue sweater and my winter coat because it's -15°C and no one cares about fashion when frostbite is a legitimate concern. Maya hugs me at the door like I'm going off to war.

"Have fun. Be yourself. Stop overthinking everything."

"That's literally impossible for me."

"I know. But try."

I drive downtown to the coffee shop Tyler suggested—The Daily Grind, a place near the university that's always full of students and smells like espresso and cinnamon. Tyler's already there when I arrive, sitting at a corner table, scrolling through his phone. He's wearing the Canucks hoodie he always wears, and when he sees me, his smile is immediate and genuine.

"Hey," he says, standing up. "I ordered already—hope that's okay. I got you a vanilla latte? But I can get you something else if—"

"Vanilla latte's perfect. Thank you."

We sit, and there's a moment of awkwardness—the first-date kind where you both suddenly remember this is a Date with a capital D and you're supposed to act accordingly. Then Tyler laughs.

"This is weird, right?"

"So weird."

"Okay good. I thought it was just me." He takes a sip of his coffee. "So. Tell me about badminton. Because I've been googling it all week and I still don't totally get the scoring."

I laugh, and something in my chest loosens. "Okay, so. Rally scoring..."

We talk about badminton for ten minutes—me explaining the rules, the strategy, the difference between singles and doubles. Tyler asks good questions, actually interested, making jokes about how complicated it seems compared to hockey's "put the puck in the net" simplicity.

"But hockey has all those penalties," I point out. "Icing and offsides and high-sticking and—"

"Okay fine, every sport is complicated when you break it down."

"Exactly."

The conversation flows easily after that. We talk about school—he's taking AP Literature and hating it, I'm taking AP History and feeling the same. We talk about college—he's going to UBC next year for hockey and marine biology, which surprises me.

"Marine biology?"

"I know, random. But my family used to vacation in Tofino every summer when I was a kid, and I got obsessed with tide pools. My dad thought I'd grow out of it." He grins. "I did not grow out of it."

"That's actually really cool."

"What about you? MIT?"

"Maybe. Or Caltech. Or Cornell. I don't know yet." I wrap my hands around my latte. "It depends on scholarships and where I get in and like, a million other factors."

"You'll get in everywhere. Ethan says you're the smartest person he knows."

My chest tightens at the mention of Ethan, but I keep my voice steady. "Ethan exaggerates."

"Nah. He's pretty accurate about most things." Tyler's quiet for a moment. "He's a good dude. Best friend I've got on the team."

"Yeah. He is."

We keep talking—about music and favorite movies and whether pineapple belongs on pizza (Tyler says yes, I say absolutely not). He tells me about his younger sister who plays hockey too, trying to follow in his footsteps. I tell him about my mom's research and my dad's restaurant dreams that never quite materialized.

It's nice. Really nice.

And it feels completely wrong.

Not because Tyler's doing anything wrong—he's perfect, attentive without being overwhelming, funny without trying too hard, genuinely interested in what I'm saying. But sitting here with him, laughing at his jokes and learning about his life, I keep having this persistent feeling like I'm in the wrong seat at the wrong table with the wrong person.

Like I'm solving an equation with an incorrect variable and no matter how carefully I work through it, the answer won't make sense.

Two hours pass somehow. The coffee shop is getting busy, people lining up for the afternoon rush, and Tyler checks his phone.

"I should probably head out. Got practice at five."

"Saturday practice?"

"Coach is brutal during season." He stands, grabbing his coat. "But this was fun. Really fun."

"Yeah, it was."

We walk outside together, the cold hitting like a wall after the warm coffee shop. Tyler offers to walk me to my car even though it's just half a block away.

"So," he says as we reach my Honda. "Would you want to do this again? Not immediately, but like, sometime?"

He's trying so hard. Standing there in the cold, breath visible, genuinely hopeful.

I should say no. I should tell him that this was nice but I'm not in the right headspace for dating right now, that I'm dealing with some stuff, that he deserves someone who's actually present instead of mentally comparing every moment to someone else.

But that would require explaining why I'm not in the right headspace. And I can't do that without explaining Ethan, and his parents, and the impossible situation I'm trying to navigate.

So instead I hear myself say: "Yeah. I'd like that."

Tyler's smile is worth it, even if I feel like a fraud.

"Cool. I'll text you." He hesitates, then leans in—for a second I think he's going to kiss me and my whole body tenses—but he just kisses my cheek. Quick, gentle, respectful.

I feel nothing.

"Drive safe," he says.

"You too."

I get in my car and watch him walk away, his Canucks hoodie bright against the grey December afternoon. Then I put my head on the steering wheel and try to figure out what I'm doing.

My phone buzzes.

**MAYA:** How'd it go???

**ME:** Fine. Good. He's really nice.

**MAYA:** That's great!!!

**MAYA:** So you like him?

I stare at that question for a long moment.

**ME:** I don't not like him.

**MAYA:** That's the most Sophia answer I've ever heard

**MAYA:** Translation: you're overthinking it

Maybe I am overthinking it. Maybe I just need time. Maybe the more I hang out with Tyler, the more this will start to feel right instead of like wearing someone else's clothes.

I drive home through streets decorated for Christmas—lights and wreaths and inflatable snowmen. When I pull into my driveway, my mom's car is there, which means she's home from her lab for once.

Inside, she's making tea in the kitchen, still in her work clothes.

"How was coffee?" she asks.

Of course Maya texted her. They've formed some kind of mom-best-friend alliance.

"It was nice."

Mom gives me a look over her tea mug. "Nice?"

"He's a nice guy, Mom."

"But?"

"But nothing. It was a nice first date with a nice person."

"Sophia." She sets down her mug. "You know you're allowed to just like someone, right? You don't have to analyze it like a physics problem."

If only she knew how much I've been doing exactly that.

"I know, Mom."

"And you know you don't have to like someone just because they're nice."

That stops me. "What do you mean?"

"I mean sometimes people are perfectly nice, perfectly acceptable, check all the boxes on paper. But if your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it." She picks up her mug again. "That's okay too."

I think about Tyler's smile, his genuine interest, the way conversation flowed easily. I think about sitting in that coffee shop feeling like I was in the wrong place.

"What if you're not sure?" I ask quietly.

"Then give it time. But be honest—with him and with yourself." Mom reaches over and squeezes my hand. "Don't date someone just to prove something or because you think you should."

"I'm not—"

"Okay." She doesn't push, just smiles. "I'm making dumplings for dinner. Want to help?"

We spend the next hour in the kitchen, folding dumplings while Mom tells me about her research and I try not to think about blue eyes and the smell of ice and a smile I've known since I was nine.

My phone buzzes while we're cooking.

**TYLER:** Thanks again for today. You're really easy to talk to.

**ME:** You too. See you Monday.

Then, thirty seconds later:

**ETHAN:** You home? Can I call?

I stare at both messages. Tyler, who I just went on a date with. Ethan, who I'm trying to protect by pulling away.

**ME:** Having dinner with family. Tomorrow?

The dots appear, disappear. Appear again.

**ETHAN:** Yeah. Tomorrow.

I put my phone away and focus on folding dumplings, but my hands aren't quite steady.

Mom doesn't comment.

## Study Group Wednesday

By Wednesday evening, I've convinced myself that the weirdness with Tyler will fade. That this is just adjustment period, getting used to the idea of dating someone new. That my brain needs time to catch up with the perfectly logical decision I've made.

Then I walk into Jordan's basement for study group and realize I've miscalculated entirely.

Tyler's there—sitting on the couch, already set up with his calc textbook. So is Ethan—at the other end of the same couch, physics homework spread across the coffee table. So are Maya, Jordan, Alex, and Marcus, all occupying various spots around the room.

Everyone looks up when I come down the stairs.

"Soph!" Maya calls. "We saved you a seat."

She's sitting in the armchair, which means the saved seat is either next to Tyler or next to Ethan on the couch.

I take the spot between them.

This is fine. We're all friends. Study group has been happening for weeks. The fact that I went on a date with Tyler last Saturday and have been avoiding meaningful conversation with Ethan for two weeks is irrelevant.

Everything is fine.

"Hey," Tyler says, smiling. "How was badminton practice?"

"Exhausting. Coach is ramping up for regionals."

"When is that again?"

"January twentieth."

"You nervous?"

"Terrified."

Ethan's watching this exchange but doesn't say anything. He's got his physics textbook open to the chapter on rotational motion—the one I helped him understand three weeks ago when everything was simpler.

"Okay," Jordan announces. "Study group rules: no phones, no distractions, we're all behind on calc and Henderson's test is Friday. Let's focus."

We settle into working, the room going mostly quiet except for the scratch of pens and occasional questions. I'm working through related rates problems—ironically, the same kind I helped Tyler with two weeks ago. I get stuck on one involving a water tank with weird dimensions.

"The radius is changing," Ethan says quietly from my right.

I look over. He's not even looking at my paper, but somehow he knows exactly where I'm stuck.

"What?"

"The radius is changing as the water level changes. That's the relationship you're missing."

He's right. Of course he's right. I set up the equation properly and it works out immediately.

"Thanks," I say.

"No problem."

We're sitting close enough that I can smell his cologne—the same one he's worn forever, something woodsy and clean. Close enough that when he shifts to write something, his shoulder brushes mine.

Close enough that every cell in my body is aware of him.

Tyler asks me a question about derivatives at the same moment, and I turn to help him, feeling like I'm being pulled in two directions at once.

Twenty minutes later, Tyler reaches over—casually, naturally—and puts his hand on my shoulder while asking about a problem. It's a nothing gesture, friendly, the kind of thing that happens in study groups all the time.

Ethan's jaw tightens.

I see it in my peripheral vision—that tiny muscle movement that means he's clenching his teeth. Then he stands abruptly.

"Taking a break," he mutters, and heads upstairs.

Jordan watches him go, then looks at me with a question in his eyes. I look away.

Maya clears her throat. "I need snacks. Soph, help me with snacks."

"We have snacks," Jordan points out.

"Different snacks. Come on, Sophia."

She practically drags me upstairs to Jordan's kitchen, where we find Ethan standing at the sink, getting water he doesn't seem to be drinking.

"We'll just be in the dining room," Maya says meaningfully, pulling me into the next room but leaving the door open. We can still hear if Ethan moves.

"What are you doing?" she whisper-hisses at me.

"What? I'm studying."

"You're torturing him."

"I'm not—"

"Sophia. You went on a date with his teammate and now you're sitting between them at study group. That's literally torture."

"I didn't know they'd both be here!"

"They're both always here. It's study group." Maya crosses her arms. "You need to figure out what you're doing. Because this?" She gestures back toward the basement. "This is not sustainable."

"I'm trying to do the right thing."

"For who?"

"For everyone."

"You mean for Ethan. Because you think walking away is noble."

"His parents—"

"His parents don't get to decide this. Neither do you, actually. He gets a say."

"Maya—"

"Talk to him. Actually talk to him. Because whatever you're doing right now? It's worse than just being honest."

She's right. I know she's right. But the thought of having that conversation, of explaining that I'm pulling away because I'm trying to protect his future, of watching him either argue or agree—I don't know which would hurt more.

We go back downstairs with chips neither of us wanted. Ethan doesn't come back down for another ten minutes, and when he does, he takes a different seat—the armchair Maya vacated, across the room instead of next to me.

The rest of study group is awkward. Tyler asks me twice if I'm okay. Jordan keeps shooting concerned looks between me and Ethan. Marcus and Alex seem oblivious, arguing about some history project, but everyone else clearly notices the tension.

When we're packing up at nine, Tyler walks me to my car like he did last Saturday.

"You sure you're okay?" he asks. "You seemed distracted."

"Just stressed about exams."

"If you want to do something chill this weekend, get your mind off school—we could catch a movie or something. No pressure."

He's so nice. So genuinely nice.

"Maybe," I say. "Let me see how this week goes."

"Sure. Text me."

He leaves, and I'm about to get in my car when I hear my name.

Ethan's jogging across Jordan's lawn, jacket not even fully zipped despite the cold.

"Can we talk?" he asks. "Please?"

My heart is hammering. "It's late."

"Five minutes. That's all I'm asking."

I look at him—at the expression on his face that's half frustration and half something that looks like pain—and I can't say no.

"Okay. Five minutes."

We stand there by my car, both of us breathing out visible clouds of air in the -18°C night. The street is quiet, Christmas lights twinkling on houses, winter pressing in from all sides.

"What's going on?" Ethan asks. "And don't say nothing, because we both know that's not true."

"I told you. Your parents want you focused on hockey—"

"I don't care what my parents want."

"You should. Ethan, you're leaving in three weeks. Prep school, better competition, NHL scouts. This is your future."

"And what? You're not part of that future?"

Yes. No. I don't know.

"We're friends," I say, and my voice sounds hollow even to me.

"Friends." He laughs, but there's no humor in it. "Right. Is that why you can't even look at me anymore? Why you're sitting as far away from me as possible? Why you're dating Tyler?"

"I'm not—we went on one date."

"Do you like him?"

"He's nice."

"That's not what I asked."

I don't answer, and that's an answer in itself.

Ethan runs a hand through his hair, frustrated. "Sophie, I don't understand what happened. Two weeks ago we were fine. We were us. And now you're acting like I did something wrong, but you won't tell me what it is, so I can't fix it."

"You didn't do anything wrong."

"Then why does it feel like you're pushing me away?"

Because I am. Because Jordan told me your parents are planning to separate us and I'm trying to make it easier. Because prep school is in three weeks and long distance doesn't work and you need to focus on hockey. Because I'm falling in love with you and it's going to end badly and I'm trying to protect both of us from that.

But I can't say any of that. So instead: "Things change, Ethan."

"Not like this. Not this fast." He steps closer, and I have to force myself not to step back. "Look at me. Please."

I do, and it's a mistake. Because his eyes are that impossible blue, the kind that makes you want to be honest even when honesty is the worst possible idea.

"I miss you," he says quietly. "I miss talking to you. I miss you texting me random science facts at midnight. I miss you explaining things and getting excited about math and looking at me like—"

He stops.

"Like what?"

"Like you see me. Not the hockey player or the Price heir or whatever. Just me."

My throat is tight. "I do see you."

"Then stop pulling away."

"I can't."

"Why not?"

Because if I don't pull away now, it's going to destroy me when you leave.

"It's complicated."

"Everything's complicated. That doesn't mean you run from it."

"Says the person whose parents are literally sending him to another state."

It comes out more bitter than I intended. Ethan blinks, surprised.

"Is that what this is about? Me leaving?"

Yes. Partly. Along with everything else.

"I'm just trying to be realistic," I say. "You're leaving December 28th. You'll be at prep school for the rest of the year. And then you'll go to some amazing hockey college, and I'll go to wherever I end up, and we'll—"

"We'll what? Drift apart? Is that what you think happens?"

"That's what usually happens."

"Not to us."

"How do you know?"

"Because we didn't drift apart the first time. When I left Kenora, when we were nine years old and had no way to stay in touch, we still found our way back to each other. So why would we drift apart now?"

I don't have an answer for that. Or I do, but it's too honest: because this time I don't trust myself to let you go and still be okay.

"The variables are different now," I say finally.

"This isn't a math problem, Sophie."

"Everything's a math problem if you set it up right."

"No. Some things are just—" He makes a frustrated gesture. "Some things you have to feel, not calculate."

"That's easy for you to say."

"Why?"

"Because you're not the one who—" I stop myself.

"Who what?"

I shake my head. "It's late. I should go."

"Sophie—"

"Please. I can't do this right now."

I get in my car before he can say anything else, before I can say anything else, before this whole conversation unravels into admissions I'm not ready to make.

As I drive away, I see him in my rearview mirror—standing in the cold, hands in pockets, watching me leave.

I make it three blocks before I have to pull over because I'm crying too hard to see the road.

## Thursday

I skip Physics on Thursday. It's the coward's move, but I don't care—I tell my mom I have a migraine, which isn't technically a lie since stress headaches basically count, and I spend the period in the library instead.

At lunch, Tyler finds me.

"Hey, you feeling better?"

For a second I don't know what he means, then I remember: the migraine excuse would have circulated after I missed first period.

"Yeah, thanks. Just needed some rest."

"You want to come to my game Friday? It's against Eastwood. Should be a good match."

I should say no. I should maintain distance, stop straddling this weird line between Tyler and Ethan.

But Maya's voice is in my head: *You need to figure out what you're doing.*

Maybe Maya's right. Maybe I need to actually try with Tyler instead of half-assing this while mentally comparing everything to Ethan. That's not fair to Tyler, and it's not fair to me.

"Sure," I say. "I'd like that."

Tyler grins. "Cool. I'll save you a seat."

"I thought I'd be in the stands."

"I meant a seat in the girlfriend section."

He says it joking, but my stomach flips anyway. "We're not—I mean, we've had one date."

"I know, I know. I'm just messing with you." But his smile is hopeful in a way that makes me feel guilty. "But like, would you want to? Be official, I mean. After the game maybe we could actually talk about it."

"Tyler..."

"No pressure. Just think about it." He squeezes my shoulder—that same casual gesture from study group—and heads off to his next class.

I sit there in the cafeteria, surrounded by people and feeling completely alone, trying to figure out how I ended up here.

My phone buzzes.

**ETHAN:** You okay? Maya said you're sick.

**ME:** Just a headache. I'm fine.

**ETHAN:** If you need the physics homework I can drop it off

**ME:** It's okay. I'll get it from the website.

**ETHAN:** Sophie

**ETHAN:** Can we please just talk? Actually talk?

I stare at that message for a long moment, then turn off my phone and put it in my bag.

At badminton practice that afternoon, Coach Martinez pulls me aside.

"Chen, you're distracted."

"Sorry, Coach."

"Regionals are five weeks away. You're one of my strongest players, but if you play like you practiced today, you won't make it past the first round."

She's right. I missed easy shots, my footwork was sloppy, and I double-faulted three times in practice matches.

"I know. I'll focus."

"Is everything okay? School, family, anything I should know about?"

"Just stressed about exams."

Coach gives me a look that says she doesn't quite believe me but isn't going to push. "Okay. But Sophia? Whatever's going on, don't let it cost you this competition. You've worked too hard."

I promise I'll do better, but as I'm leaving practice, I'm not sure it's a promise I can keep.

Maya finds me in the parking lot.

"You've been avoiding me," she says.

"I haven't—"

"Soph. You literally hid in the library during lunch."

"I was studying."

"You were hiding." She leans against my car. "And you're still not dealing with the Ethan thing."

"There is no Ethan thing."

"There's definitely an Ethan thing. And now there's a Tyler thing. And you're in the middle of both things looking miserable."

"I'm not miserable."

"You're crying in your car after study group. That's pretty much the definition of miserable."

I didn't know she saw that.

Maya's expression softens. "Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do. But you're my best friend, and watching you do this to yourself is killing me. Whatever you're afraid of with Ethan—"

"He's leaving in two weeks."

"So? People do long distance."

"His parents don't want us together."

"Since when do you care what other people's parents think?"

Since those parents have the power to control their son's entire future, I don't say.

"It's complicated," I say instead.

"It's only as complicated as you make it." Maya pulls me into a hug. "I love you, but you need to stop being noble and start being honest. With Tyler, with Ethan, with yourself."

After she leaves, I sit in my car for a long time, engine running, heat blasting, trying to figure out how to be honest when I'm not even sure what the truth is anymore.

## Friday Night Game

I almost don't go.

I'm sitting in my car outside Beavers Arena, watching people stream inside for the game, trying to convince myself to either go in or drive away.

Maya's been texting me for twenty minutes: *Where are you? I'm in the stands. Tyler keeps looking for you.*

I should go in. I told Tyler I'd be here. But the thought of sitting in the girlfriend section, watching Ethan play while officially here as Tyler's... whatever I am... feels impossible.

Finally, I text back: *Coming. Had to park far away.*

It's a lie. I'm parked in the third row.

I force myself out of the car, into the cold, through the arena doors. The game hasn't started yet—teams are warming up, crowd filling in. I find Maya in our usual spot, five rows up from the glass.

"Finally," she says. "I was about to send a search party."

"Sorry. Traffic."

She gives me a look that says she knows that's bullshit but doesn't call me on it.

On the ice, I spot Tyler immediately—number 7, running drills with the defense line. And Ethan—number 19, practicing shots with Marcus.

They look focused, professional. Like nothing's wrong.

Unlike me, apparently, who can't even show up to a hockey game without having an existential crisis.

The game starts, and Eastwood is good—better than I expected. They score first, six minutes in, and our section groans. Tyler's playing solid defense like always, but Ethan seems off. Not glaringly bad, just not quite as sharp as usual. He misses a pass he should have caught, takes a shot that goes wide.

"He's having an off night," Maya observes.

I don't answer, but I can't stop watching him. Watching the tension in his shoulders, the way he's skating angry instead of smart.

Tyler's line scores midway through the second period, tying the game. Our section cheers, and Tyler looks up at the stands—right at me. I wave, smiling, trying to look like I'm supposed to be here.

He smiles back, then gets back to the game.

Third period, Eastwood scores again. Then we score. Then they score. It's 3-2, Eastwood leading, with five minutes left when Ethan gets into a fight.

It's not even a real fight—just a shoving match with an Eastwood forward who checked him too hard. But Ethan doesn't let it go, pushing back, and before I know it they're both in the penalty box and the crowd is booing the refs.

"What is he doing?" Maya asks.

I don't know. Ethan doesn't usually play like this—angry, reckless. He's always been the controlled one, the strategic player who thinks three moves ahead.

This isn't him.

We lose 3-2.

The team files off the ice looking frustrated, and I watch Ethan pull off his helmet and throw it in the bench in a way that makes me flinch.

"You want to wait for Tyler?" Maya asks.

"I told him I'd say hi after."

We go downstairs to the usual spot outside the locker room. Other girls are already there—the actual hockey girlfriends who know all the traditions and wear their boyfriends' jerseys and fit seamlessly into this world.

I don't fit. I'm wearing my badminton team jacket and jeans and I feel like an imposter.

Tyler comes out fifteen minutes later, hair damp, still in his under-padding.

"Hey," he says, and his smile is tired but genuine. "Thanks for coming."

"Of course. You played great."

"We lost."

"You still played great."

He laughs. "That's nice of you to say. Hey, a few of us are going to Danny's. You want to come?"

I should say yes. That's what you do when you're dating someone—you go to the team dinners, you support them after tough games, you be present.

But I can't. I can't sit at Danny's and watch Ethan across the table and pretend everything's fine.

"I can't tonight. Early badminton practice tomorrow."

"Saturday practice?"

"Coach is intense about regionals."

"Right, yeah. That makes sense." He's disappointed—I can see it in his eyes even though he's trying to hide it. "Rain check?"

"Definitely."

He leans in and kisses my cheek—the same spot as last Saturday, gentle and respectful. I still feel nothing.

"Text me tomorrow?" he says.

"I will."

I walk out with Maya, who doesn't say anything until we're in the parking lot.

"You're going to break his heart," she says quietly.

"What?"

"Tyler. You're going to break his heart because you're not actually into him."

"I just need time—"

"Sophia. You couldn't even stay for Danny's. You can barely look at him without looking guilty. That's not fair to him."

"I know."

"So what are you going to do about it?"

I don't have an answer.

We drive home in silence, and when I get to my house, I sit in my driveway for twenty minutes with the engine off, feeling the cold seep in, before finally going inside.

My phone has three messages.

**TYLER:** Thanks again for coming tonight. Meant a lot.

**MAYA:** Love you. But seriously figure this out.

**ETHAN:** We need to talk. Please.

I respond to Tyler: *Anytime. Get some rest.*

I don't respond to the other two.

Instead, I go to my room and open my physics notebook, finding that equation I've been avoiding.

**E + S = impossible**

But underneath it, in Ethan's handwriting from weeks ago when he borrowed my notebook to show me a better way to solve a problem, there's a note I never erased:

*Nothing's impossible. You just haven't found the right equation yet. - E*

I trace my finger over his writing and let myself admit what I've been trying to deny for two weeks:

I don't want to date Tyler.

I don't want to walk away from Ethan.

I don't want to be noble or self-sacrificing or realistic.

I just want to be honest.

But honest means telling Tyler I can't do this, and telling Ethan why I've been distant, and facing the fact that there are two weeks until prep school and no good solution to any of this.

Honest means everything gets harder before it gets better.

If it gets better at all.

I close my notebook and turn off my light and lie in the dark, listening to winter wind against my window.

Tomorrow, I promise myself. Tomorrow I'll be honest.

But tonight, I let myself be a coward for one more day.
