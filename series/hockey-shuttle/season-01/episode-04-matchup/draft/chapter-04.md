# CHAPTER 4: NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION

## Finals Week

The thing about having a boyfriend during finals week is that you're supposed to spend less time together, not more.

But Ethan and I are operating on a countdown clock—he leaves for Michigan on January 4th (pushed back from the 28th because of hockey playoffs), which means we have less than two weeks total. So we study together every day, our textbooks spread across coffee shop tables and library carrels and Jordan's basement.

We're making the most of limited time.

"Okay," Ethan says on Thursday, three days before Christmas. We're at The Daily Grind, allegedly studying for our respective finals. "If you have a ball rolling down a ramp, and the ramp angle is 30 degrees, and the ball mass is—"

"Five kilograms, I got it." I work through the problem, drawing force diagrams in my notebook. "The acceleration is 4.9 meters per second squared."

"Show off."

"You literally asked me to solve it."

"I wanted to see you work through it. It's impressive."

I look up from my notebook. "You're distracting me."

"You're already done with the problem."

"Doesn't mean I'm not distracted."

He grins and goes back to his calc homework, but his foot is still touching mine under the table. We've been like this all week—finding excuses to be near each other, stealing moments between study sessions, cramming in time like we can store it up for when he's gone.

My phone buzzes. Maya: *hows studying? by which i mean hows NOT studying with your boyfriend*

**ME:** were actually studying. hendersons final is tomorrow

**MAYA:** sure you are

**ME:** im solving physics problems right now

**MAYA:** uh huh. and im sure youre super focused and not at all distracted by his face

**ME:** his face is very distracting but im managing

**MAYA:** hopeless. both of you

She's not wrong.

Finals continue through Friday—calc in the morning (brutal but manageable), history in the afternoon (essay questions I definitely BS'd my way through). By the time school lets out for winter break, I'm exhausted and relieved in equal measure.

Ethan finds me at my locker.

"Survive finals?"

"Barely. You?"

"Henderson's calc final was designed to break spirits."

"Truth."

He leans against the locker next to mine, and I'm struck again by how easy this is. How after weeks of tension and avoiding each other, we've settled into something that feels inevitable and right.

"So," he says. "Maya's having a New Year's party."

"I heard."

"You going?"

"Probably. You?"

"Depends. Will you be there?"

I close my locker, smiling at him. "That's very codependent of you."

"I prefer 'romantically devoted.'"

"Big words for a hockey player."

"I'm a hockey player who reads." He pushes off the locker, slinging his bag over his shoulder. "Come on. I'll walk you to your car."

"It's literally in the parking lot."

"Which is a whole thirty seconds away. I'm making the most of my time."

We walk out together, and the school is in that weird post-finals energy—everyone relieved and excited for break, making plans and exchanging gifts. Someone's set up a speaker in the parking lot playing Christmas music.

At my car, Ethan pulls out a small wrapped box from his backpack.

"What's this?"

"Christmas present. Open it now, because I won't see you until after."

"We're doing presents?"

"I'm doing a present. You don't have to reciprocate."

I open it carefully—inside is a silver bracelet, delicate and simple, with a small charm. When I look closer, I see it's a shuttlecock on one side and a hockey stick on the other.

"Ethan..."

"It's cheesy. I know it's cheesy. But I saw it online and thought—"

I kiss him, right there in the school parking lot with Christmas music playing and probably twenty people watching.

"I love it," I say when we break apart. "Help me put it on?"

He does, his fingers gentle on my wrist, and when it's clasped, I hold it up to the light. The charm catches the winter sun, spinning slightly.

"I have something for you too," I admit. "But it's at home. Can I give it to you at Maya's party?"

"You got me a present?"

"Don't sound so surprised."

"I'm not surprised. Just happy." He kisses my forehead. "I'll see you New Year's Eve?"

"You'll see me before that. We have Christmas."

"Right. My family does dinner on Christmas Eve. You?"

"Christmas Day, usually. Lots of food, my mom's family on video call, the whole thing."

We make plans to text on Christmas, to see each other at Maya's party, to cram in as much time as possible before January 4th arrives.

But standing here in the parking lot, winter sun bright and cold around us, it feels like we have all the time in the world.

## Christmas Eve

Christmas Eve at the Chen house is quieter than usual—just me, my parents, and takeout from their favorite Chinese restaurant because my mom refused to cook after spending all week in her lab.

We're halfway through dinner when my dad asks: "So. This boy. Ethan?"

I nearly choke on my rice.

"Dad—"

"Your mother says he's the one from Kenora. Your friend from when you were young."

"He is."

"And now he's your boyfriend?"

Mom shoots him a look. "Wei, we talked about this. You were going to be casual about it."

"I am being casual! I'm asking casual questions!"

"You're interrogating."

"I'm being fatherly."

I hide my smile in my water glass. "Yes, Dad. Ethan's my boyfriend. We've known each other since we were nine. He's smart and kind and plays hockey. His family is... complicated. But he's a good person."

Dad considers this, eating in silence for a moment. Finally: "Does he treat you well?"

"Yes."

"Does he make you happy?"

"Very."

"Then that's acceptable." He goes back to his food like that settles it.

Mom reaches over and squeezes my hand. "We're happy for you, sweetheart. Your dad's just being protective."

"I'm sitting right here," Dad protests. "I can hear you talking about me."

After dinner, we exchange gifts—books for me, new lab equipment for my mom (she requested it specifically), a fancy tea set for my dad. It's quiet and nice and comfortable.

Around ten PM, my phone buzzes.

**ETHAN:** merry christmas eve. my familys dinner was exactly as awkward as expected

**ME:** that bad?

**ETHAN:** dad spent twenty minutes lecturing about prep school opportunities. mom asked three times if im "focused on priorities." jordan was the only person acting normal

**ME:** im sorry

**ETHAN:** its fine. par for the course with the hayeses. hows your christmas?

**ME:** good. quiet. my dad gave me the "does this boy treat you well" speech

**ETHAN:** what did you say?

**ME:** that you're acceptable

**ETHAN:** ACCEPTABLE??

**ME:** im paraphrasing. i said you make me happy

**ETHAN:** thats better. though "acceptable" is hilarious

**ME:** my dads exact words were "thats acceptable." its a ringing endorsement by his standards

**ETHAN:** ill take it

We text for another hour—about Christmas movies and bad holiday music and whether fruitcake is actually cake or some kind of construction material. It's easy and comfortable and makes me forget for a while that in less than two weeks he'll be in Michigan and I'll be here.

Before bed, I pull out his Christmas present from where I've hidden it in my closet—a book on the physics of hockey I found at a used bookstore, with notes in the margins from whoever owned it before. Inside, I've written:

*For when you need to remember that hockey is just applied physics. And for when you need to remember home. - S*

It's not as nice as the bracelet he got me. But it's honest, and I think he'll like it.

I fall asleep to snow falling outside my window and the warmth of knowing someone's thinking about me across the city.

## New Year's Eve - Before the Party

Maya's party starts at eight, but she demands I show up at seven to help set up.

"Set up what?" I ask when I arrive at her house, arms full of the chips and pop she requested I bring. "It's just your basement."

"It's not just my basement. It's a carefully curated party space."

"You put up string lights and called it decorating."

"It's ambiance!"

Jordan's already there, helping move furniture to make room for dancing. He waves when he sees me.

"She's been like this for an hour," he says. "Very intense about the ambiance."

"I heard that!" Maya calls from where she's adjusting speakers. "And yes, I'm intense. This is our first official party where Sophia has a boyfriend. That's a milestone."

"It's really not," I say.

"It absolutely is. You've been pining for weeks—"

"Two weeks—"

"—and now you're together and it's New Year's Eve and I'm creating the perfect atmosphere for romance."

"You know there are going to be like thirty people here, right?" Jordan points out.

"Thirty people, perfect ambiance, same thing."

We spend the next hour setting up—string lights (fine, it does add ambiance), a table for food and drinks, music queued up on Maya's carefully curated playlist. By 7:45, the basement looks less like someone's random party and more like an actual event.

"Okay," Maya says, surveying her work with satisfaction. "This is good. People will be impressed."

"People will be drunk on cheap punch and won't notice either way," Jordan says.

"You have no appreciation for my artistic vision."

"I have immense appreciation for your artistic vision. I helped hang those lights."

They bicker affectionately while I check my phone. Ethan texted ten minutes ago that he's on his way, bringing Marcus and Alex with him. Tyler's coming too—we've texted a few times since formal, friendly and comfortable now that we're not trying to date.

The first people arrive at 8:15—some of Maya's art class friends, a few people from badminton, a handful of Jordan's photography club crowd. By 8:45, the basement is full, music loud, everyone in that pre-party energy where everything's possibility and nothing's happened yet.

Ethan arrives at nine, and I feel it before I see him—that awareness of his presence, the way my attention shifts automatically. He finds me near the food table, and his smile is immediate and warm.

"Hey."

"Hey yourself."

He pulls me into a hug, and I can smell his cologne—woodsy and familiar, the scent that's become home. When we break apart, I'm hyperaware of people watching, of being that couple at the party.

"I have your Christmas present," I say.

"Now?"

"Why not now?"

We find a quieter corner—relatively speaking, the music is still loud—and I hand him the wrapped book.

He opens it carefully, and I watch his expression shift from curious to touched.

"The Physics of Hockey," he reads. "Soph, this is perfect."

"Read the inside."

He does, and something in his face softens. "Thank you. Really. This is—thank you."

"You're welcome."

He kisses me, quick but sweet, and someone nearby catcalls. We ignore them.

"I can't believe I'm leaving in five days," he says quietly.

"Let's not think about that tonight. Let's just... be here. Now."

"Deal."

We rejoin the party—dancing badly to songs neither of us know, eating too many chips, talking to people in that overlapping group way where conversations blur together. Tyler shows up with some of the hockey team, including a few guys I don't know. He waves at me across the room, and I wave back.

"That's not weird?" Ethan asks.

"What?"

"Tyler being here. After you guys dated."

"We went on like two dates. And he's friends with you. Why would it be weird?"

"I don't know. It feels like it should be weird."

"Only if we make it weird."

Tyler comes over a few minutes later, beer in hand even though we're supposed to be keeping this party non-alcoholic. Maya's parents are conveniently out of town, trusting us to be responsible, which clearly has different definitions.

"Hayes, Chen," he greets us. "Nice party."

"Maya decorated," I say.

"It shows. Very atmospheric." He takes a sip of his beer. "So. You two figure everything out?"

"Getting there," Ethan says.

"Good. You were both insufferable when you were apart."

"Gee, thanks."

"Just being honest." He grins. "Anyway, I'm going to go lose at beer pong. Have a good New Year."

He wanders off, and Ethan looks at me.

"He's really okay with this."

"He's really okay with it."

"Weird."

"Or healthy and mature."

"Also weird."

The party continues—people dancing, people talking, people playing the various games Maya set up. Around 10:30, someone suggests karaoke and suddenly we're all watching Marcus murder "Don't Stop Believin'" while Alex provides backup vocals that are somehow worse.

It's chaotic and fun and exactly what a New Year's party should be.

At 11:45, Maya turns down the music and announces: "Fifteen minutes till midnight! Get your resolutions ready!"

People start pairing off—couples finding each other, friend groups clustering together. Ethan's hand finds mine.

"Want to go outside?" he asks. "It's getting loud in here."

"It's probably -25 out there."

"So we'll freeze together."

We grab our coats and head out to Maya's back deck—a covered space with heaters that are running but barely making a dent in the cold. A few other people are out here too, but it's quieter than inside, more space to breathe.

The sky is clear, stars brilliant, the kind of cold that makes everything sharp and immediate.

"Five more days," Ethan says.

"You're breaking our deal. We're not thinking about that tonight."

"I can't stop thinking about it."

I lean against the deck railing, looking out at Maya's snow-covered backyard. "What are you going to do at prep school?"

"Play hockey. Go to classes. Try not to hate everything."

"Ethan."

"Sorry. That's not fair." He stands next to me, close enough that our shoulders touch. "I'm going to work hard. Impress the scouts. Make my dad's investment worth it."

"That sounds miserable."

"Little bit." He's quiet for a moment. "But I'm also going to text you every day. Video call when we can. Count down until spring break."

"March 10th."

"Ten weeks from tomorrow."

It sounds like forever and no time at all.

"What's your New Year's resolution?" I ask.

"Don't laugh."

"I won't laugh."

"To be honest. About what I want, what I'm feeling, all of it. No more pretending things don't matter when they do."

I look at him—at his profile in the deck lights, the way his breath clouds in the cold. "That's a good resolution."

"What's yours?"

"Same, I think. Stop trying to logic my way out of feelings. Stop being so scared of complications that I run from things worth having."

"We're very mature."

"Exceptionally mature."

"Or just tired of being miserable."

"That too."

Inside, people are starting the countdown. We can hear them through the sliding glass door: "Two minutes! Get your people!"

"You're my people," Ethan says.

"That was extremely cheesy."

"You loved it."

He's not wrong.

More people come outside as midnight approaches—Maya and Jordan together (finally), Tyler and some teammates, various couples and friend groups. Everyone's got that New Year's energy, that sense of endings and beginnings.

"One minute!" someone shouts.

Ethan turns to face me fully. "So. New Year's kiss. That's a thing, right?"

"It's definitely a thing."

"Just checking. Wanted to make sure I had permission."

"You have permanent permission at this point."

"Good to know."

The countdown starts: "Ten... nine... eight..."

"Seven... six... five..."

His hands find my face, gentle even through his gloves.

"Four... three... two..."

"Happy New Year, Sophie."

"One... HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

And then he's kissing me while everyone around us is cheering and noisemakers are going off and somewhere fireworks are starting up. It's cold and loud and perfect, his lips warm against mine, his hands framing my face like I'm something precious.

I pour everything into this kiss—all the fear about him leaving, all the hope for what comes after, all the love I haven't quite said out loud yet but feel in every cell of my body.

When we finally break apart, Maya's crying happy tears and hugging Jordan, Tyler's spraying cheap champagne like he won the Stanley Cup, and everyone's in that post-countdown chaos of celebrating and calling people and taking photos.

"Best New Year's ever?" Ethan asks.

"Definitely top three."

"What are the other two?"

"Not telling. You'll get competitive."

"I'm already competitive."

We stay outside for a while longer, even though the cold is brutal, because inside is too loud and out here is just us and a few other people who also wanted quiet. We talk about nothing important—favorite foods and worst movies and whether dogs or cats make better pets.

We don't talk about January 4th.

We don't talk about ten weeks apart.

We just exist in this moment, in the first hour of a new year, pretending we have all the time in the world.

Around 1 AM, people start leaving. Tyler finds us to say goodbye—he's getting a ride with Marcus and Alex.

"Good party," he says. "Good kiss. I saw it. Very cinematic."

"Were you watching?" I ask.

"Everyone was watching. You're very obvious people."

"Thanks, Kim," Ethan says, but he's smiling.

"Anytime, Hayes." Tyler pulls me into a quick hug. "Happy New Year, Sophia. Don't let him forget about you while he's in Michigan."

"I won't."

"Good." He heads out, and Ethan and I help Maya and Jordan clean up—collecting cups, taking down decorations, wiping down surfaces. It's quiet work, comfortable, the kind of thing friends do at the end of good nights.

By 2 AM, Jordan and I are the last people left. Maya's already half-asleep on the couch, insisting she'll clean more tomorrow.

"I should get home," I say. "My parents' curfew is flexible but not infinite."

"I'll walk you to your car," Ethan offers.

"It's literally in the driveway."

"Making the most of my time, remember?"

We walk out together into the brutal January cold—winter at its worst, the kind of temperature that makes your face hurt immediately. My car is covered in frost, and I have to scrape ice off the windshield before I can drive.

Ethan helps, both of us working with scrapers, our breath visible in the streetlight.

"Four more days," he says.

"I thought we weren't talking about it."

"That was yesterday. It's a new year now. New rules."

"What are the new rules?"

"We're honest. No pretending it's not hard. No trying to make it easier than it is." He finishes his side of the windshield and comes around to where I'm working. "I don't want to leave. I don't want to be apart for ten weeks. I don't want to miss seeing you every day."

"Ethan—"

"But I'm going anyway. Because I have to. Because my dad's already paid for everything and the team's expecting me and there's too much riding on this." He takes the scraper from my hands and sets it down. "So let's not waste these four days pretending it's fine. Let's just be together until I have to go."

My throat is tight. "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay."

He kisses me again—slower this time, without the countdown pressure, just us in Maya's driveway at 2 AM on New Year's Day. It tastes like goodbye and promise and desperation all at once.

"Drive safe," he says when we break apart.

"Always."

"Text me when you get home."

"It's a ten-minute drive."

"Text me anyway."

I do, sitting in my driveway with the engine still running: *home safe. today was perfect*

**ETHAN:** it really was. sleep well watson

**ME:** you too sherlock

I go inside to my parents sleeping and my room exactly as I left it and my life that's about to get significantly more complicated.

But for tonight, I let myself just be happy.

Tomorrow I can worry about everything else.

---

## January 2nd - 10 AM

I'm helping my mom take down Christmas decorations when the black Mercedes pulls into our driveway.

For a second, I think maybe Ethan's parents sent a car for him, that maybe he forgot something here. Then I see Robert Hayes get out—alone, no Caroline, no Ethan—and my stomach drops.

He's carrying an envelope.

"Sophia?" Mom calls from the living room. "Did you order something?"

"No."

The doorbell rings.

My dad answers it, and I hear voices in the entryway—Robert's smooth, professional tone, my dad's more cautious response. Then Dad's calling: "Sophia, can you come here please?"

I walk to the entryway like I'm walking to my own execution.

Robert Hayes looks exactly like Ethan will look in thirty years—same blue eyes, same sharp features, but colder somehow. More calculated. He's wearing an expensive coat and a smile that doesn't reach his eyes.

"Sophia," he says. "I apologize for the intrusion. But I was hoping we could talk."

"About what?"

"About my son. And your relationship with him." He glances at my dad. "Perhaps we could speak inside? It's quite cold."

My parents exchange a look. Finally, Dad steps back. "Come in. Would you like tea?"

"That would be lovely, thank you."

We end up in the living room—Robert on the armchair, my parents on the couch, me perched on the edge of the other chair like I'm about to bolt. Mom brings tea that no one drinks.

Robert doesn't sit. He stands by our window, looking out at our ordinary street like he's calculating property values. The envelope in his hand is crisp, expensive paper—the kind that makes important things feel more important.

"Your father tells me you've applied to MIT," he says conversationally. "Early action. Admirable. The acceptance rate is 4.8 percent this year. Even lower for international students, though I suppose you're not quite that."

"Mr. Hayes—"

"Did you know," he continues as if I hadn't spoken, "that seventy-three percent of high school relationships end within the first three months of college? The statistics are even worse for relationships where one partner doesn't attend college at all. Say, if they're pursuing professional sports instead."

My stomach drops. "Why are you here?"

He turns from the window, and his smile is almost kind. Almost.

"I'm here because I see potential in you, Sophia. Real potential. The kind that shouldn't be wasted on a statistically doomed teenage romance." He sets the envelope on our coffee table. "MIT's admissions board was very impressed with your application. However, as you know, impressive isn't always enough. Sometimes one needs... an advocate."

"I don't understand—"

"I sit on the board of directors for three companies that fund MIT's engineering program. My recommendation carries significant weight. Enough weight to turn a maybe into a yes. Enough to include a full scholarship—not just tuition, but room, board, research stipends, even study abroad opportunities."

The room feels like it's spinning. My parents are both very still, watching him like he's a snake that might strike.

"You're trying to bribe me," I say.

"Bribe?" He looks genuinely offended. "I'm offering you an opportunity. One that has nothing to do with my son, actually. You've earned this on your own merits. I'm simply... facilitating."

"In exchange for what?"

He picks up a photo from our mantle—me at age twelve with a science fair trophy, gap-toothed smile, holding my project on renewable energy.

"You're a smart girl, Sophia. Smart enough to know that Ethan's hockey career is at a crucial juncture. Scouts are watching. Professional leagues are interested. But he's distracted. His performance is suffering. His coach has noticed. The scouts have noticed."

"That's not—"

"Three games with subpar performance since you two became involved. His shooting percentage down twelve percent. Penalty minutes up thirty percent." He sets the photo down precisely where it was, like he's rearranging chess pieces. "I've spent thirteen years and approximately four hundred thousand dollars developing his talent. Hockey equipment, training camps, private coaching, travel teams, nutritionists, sports psychologists. All leading to this moment—his chance at the NHL."

"You make him sound like an investment."

"Aren't all children investments? Your parents invested in your education. Those badminton lessons, the physics tutors, the academic summer camps. All hoping for a return—seeing you succeed, seeing you happy, seeing you fulfill your potential."

He's not wrong, and that's the worst part. My parents have sacrificed so much for my education—Dad working extra hours, Mom taking on additional research projects. All so I could have opportunities they didn't.

"What exactly are you asking?" My voice sounds steadier than I feel.

Robert opens the envelope, revealing the MIT letterhead that makes my heart stop. "I'm asking you to be practical. To think beyond the emotions of the moment. Ethan leaves for Michigan in two days. You have regionals, then nationals, then graduation, then MIT. Your paths are already diverging. All I'm suggesting is that you let them."

"You want me to break up with him."

"I want you to stop texting him. Stop calling. Stop giving him hope for something that will only hurt you both in the end. A clean break. He focuses on hockey, you focus on MIT. In five years, you'll both thank me."

"And if I say no?"

His smile doesn't change, but something in his eyes goes cold. It's like watching ice form on a window—beautiful and deadly.

"Then you apply to MIT like everyone else. Four point eight percent acceptance rate. Without my recommendation. Without the scholarship. And Ethan... well, Ethan will make his own choices, won't he? Perhaps he'll defer prep school to stay near you. Perhaps he'll lose focus entirely. Young love makes people do foolish things. I've seen it destroy promising careers before."

The threat is clear: I'm not just choosing my future. I'm choosing Ethan's too.

My dad stands abruptly. "I think—"

"Wait." My voice sounds far away. "The offer. What are the exact terms?"

Robert's expression shifts to something like satisfaction. "Guaranteed admission to MIT, early action decision by February first. Four years full tuition plus ten thousand dollars annual stipend for living expenses, research opportunities with leading researchers in theoretical physics, mentorship program, priority consideration for graduate programs. All expenses paid. All doors open."

He pulls out a second sheet of paper, sliding it across the coffee table.

"In exchange, you agree to terminate all romantic and personal contact with Ethan Hayes until May 2029. Four and a half years. No texts, no calls, no visits, no contact of any kind. After college graduation, you're both free to reconnect if you wish. But for these crucial years—his launch into professional hockey, your undergraduate education—you let each other focus."

"This conversation," he adds, standing to leave, "stays between us. You wouldn't want Ethan to think you only got into MIT because of connections. That would taint your entire academic career, wouldn't it? Every achievement would have an asterisk. Every success would have people wondering if you really earned it."

My mom makes a sound like she's been punched.

"You have twenty-four hours to decide, Sophia. The admissions board meets Friday morning. After that, decisions are final and the offer expires." He buttons his coat with precise movements. "Oh, and one more thing."

He pulls out a photograph from his pocket, places it face-down on top of the contract.

"I know about New Year's Eve. The kissing. The plans to try long distance. I've been watching—not personally, of course. But parents have resources." He heads toward the door, then pauses. "You're already hurting him, Sophia. His game performance proves that. The question is whether you'll stop now, when it can still lead to something good for both of you, or whether you'll drag it out until you destroy each other."

The door closes with a soft click.

The three of us stand in the living room, staring at the papers on the coffee table. I reach for the photograph with shaking hands, flip it over.

It's from New Year's Eve. Ethan and me kissing at midnight, his hands framing my face, my eyes closed, both of us lost in the moment.

Someone was watching. Someone Robert hired. The violation of it—the calculated cruelty—makes me want to throw up.

But worse is the contract beneath it. The MIT seal at the top. The dollar amounts spelled out in black and white.

Full ride. Four years. Everything covered. Research opportunities. Mentorship. Everything I've dreamed of since I was twelve years old, holding that science fair trophy.

For the price of everything I want.

"That man," my mother says finally, voice shaking with fury, "is a manipulative piece of—"

"Ling," Dad warns.

"I was going to say work. Manipulative piece of work."

I sink back into the chair, the photograph burning in my hands. "He's offering me MIT."

"He's blackmailing you," Mom corrects. "There's a difference."

"But he's offering me MIT. Full scholarship. Research opportunities. Everything I've been working toward."

"At the cost of your relationship with someone you care about," Dad points out.

"For four years. Not forever."

"Sophia." Mom sits next to me, taking both my hands. "Look at me. What do you want?"

"I want both. I want MIT and I want Ethan and I want everything to not be this complicated."

"I know, sweetheart. But that's not the question. The question is: if you had to choose, what would you choose?"

I look at the contract. Everything I've worked for. Four years of straight As, science competitions, research projects, studying until 2 AM. All of it could lead here, to MIT, to my dream school, to the future I've been planning since I was old enough to understand what physics was.

But it requires giving up Ethan. For four and a half years. No texts, no calls, no visits. Just... nothing.

By the time we're both free, we'll be different people. We'll have lived different lives. The boy I know now won't be the same person I find in 2029—if I find him at all.

"I don't know," I whisper. "I don't know what to choose."

Mom pulls me into a hug. Dad joins us, both of them holding me while I try not to cry.

"You don't have to decide right now," Dad says. "You have twenty-four hours."

"That's not enough time."

"No. It's not." Mom's voice is tight with anger. "That's the point. He's forcing you to make an impossible choice under pressure."

I pull away, staring at the photograph. Ethan's face, so happy, so unguarded. Not knowing his father was already planning this. Not knowing that our perfect New Year's kiss was being documented as evidence against us.

"What do I do?"

Neither of them answers, because there is no good answer.

Twenty-four hours to decide between my dream school and someone I'm falling in love with.

Between the future I've always planned and the future I'm just starting to imagine.

Between everything I've worked for and everything I want.

And no matter what I choose, I lose something.

---

## Later That Day

I don't tell Ethan.

I know I should. I know this decision affects him too, that he deserves to know his father is trying to pay me to break up with him.

But I can't. Not yet. Not while I'm still trying to figure out what to do.

Instead, I text: *can we see each other tomorrow?*

**ETHAN:** of course. your place or mine?

**ME:** the forks? noon?

**ETHAN:** perfect. everything okay?

**ME:** yeah. just want to see you

**ETHAN:** miss you too. even though we just saw each other last night

**ME:** that was 14 hours ago. basically forever

**ETHAN:** basically

I put my phone down and look at the envelope, which I've brought up to my room. It's sitting on my desk, next to my physics textbook and the acceptance letters from other schools that aren't MIT.

Twenty-four hours to decide.

I pick up my physics notebook, find a blank page, and start working through the problem like I always do:

**Variable M** = MIT (guaranteed admission, full scholarship, dream school)

**Variable E** = Ethan (relationship, feelings, history, future together)

**Variable T** = Time (4.5 years apart, no contact, separate lives)

**Variable U** = Unknown factors (will we even be the same people? will he wait? will I regret either choice?)

**If M → must sacrifice E for time T**

**If E → must sacrifice M (possibly, unless I get in normally)**

**If neither → ??? (is there a third option?)**

I work through scenarios, trying to calculate probabilities, trying to logic my way to the right answer.

But this isn't physics. There is no right answer. There's only choice.

Around dinner, Maya texts: *so hows the post-new-years bliss?*

I stare at that message for a long time.

Finally: *complicated*

**MAYA:** what happened?

**ME:** can i call you?

**MAYA:** obviously

I call, and the whole story spills out—Robert Hayes showing up, the envelope, the offer, the impossible choice. Maya listens without interrupting, which is unusual for her.

When I finish, she's quiet for a moment. Then: "Holy shit."

"Yeah."

"That's... that's actually insane. He's bribing you."

"With my dream school."

"Still a bribe." She pauses. "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know."

"What do you want to do?"

"I don't know that either."

"Okay. Let's logic this out." I can hear her moving around, probably pacing her room. "Scenario one: you take the offer. You get MIT, full ride, everything you've wanted. But you don't talk to Ethan for four years. How does that feel?"

I try to imagine it. Four years of college without him. No texts when something reminds me of him, no calls when I'm stressed about exams, no visits during breaks. Just nothing.

"Terrible," I admit. "It feels terrible."

"Okay. Scenario two: you reject the offer. You stay with Ethan, see where it goes. But you might not get into MIT on your own. How does that feel?"

I imagine getting rejection letters from MIT in April. Wondering if I made the right choice. Watching other people get opportunities I gave up.

"Also terrible."

"Great. So both options suck."

"Not helpful, Maya."

"I'm not trying to be helpful, I'm trying to be honest." She sighs. "Look, Soph. I can't tell you what to do. But I can tell you that relationships are a risk and dreams are a risk and literally everything is a risk. The question isn't which choice is safe. The question is which choice you can live with."

"I don't know."

"Then think about it. But also—talk to Ethan. He deserves to know what his dad's trying to do."

She's right. I know she's right.

But I'm not ready for that conversation yet.

## That Night - 11 PM

I can't sleep. I've been lying in bed for two hours, staring at my ceiling, trying to decide.

My phone buzzes. Ethan: *you awake?*

**ME:** unfortunately

**ETHAN:** same. cant stop thinking about leaving in two days

**ME:** lets not talk about that

**ETHAN:** what should we talk about?

**ME:** anything else. favorite color. best pizza topping. whether time travel is theoretically possible

**ETHAN:** time travel is definitely possible. just impractical

**ME:** spoken like someone who didnt pay attention in physics

**ETHAN:** i paid attention. i just had a very cute tutor who was distracting

**ME:** your tutor was your teacher

**ETHAN:** i meant you. you were my unofficial tutor. and very distracting

Even through text, he can make me smile.

**ETHAN:** hey. real talk for a second?

**ME:** okay

**ETHAN:** i know long distance is going to suck. i know were both scared. but i meant what i said on new years. i want to try. with you. whatever that looks like

My throat is tight. I'm staring at his message, thinking about the envelope on my desk, the choice I have to make by tomorrow.

**ME:** i want to try too

**ETHAN:** yeah?

**ME:** yeah

**ETHAN:** good. because youre kind of my favorite person

**ME:** kind of?

**ETHAN:** definitely. youre definitely my favorite person

**ME:** thats better

We text until almost 1 AM—about nothing important, just existing in each other's presence through screens. Finally, he says goodnight and I'm alone again with my thoughts and my choice.

I get out of bed and walk to my desk. Pick up the contract.

I read it three times, trying to find a loophole, some way to have both things.

There isn't one.

At the bottom, a single line:

*Acceptance of this offer requires written agreement to terminate all romantic and personal contact with Ethan James Hayes until May 2029.*

Four and a half years. In writing.

I fold the letter carefully and put it back in the envelope.

Tomorrow I'm seeing Ethan at noon. Tomorrow I have to decide what to tell him, what to choose, what to do with this impossible situation his father created.

Tomorrow everything changes, no matter what I choose.

I set my alarm for 8 AM, turn off my light, and try to sleep.

But I lie awake for hours, watching shadows on my ceiling, trying to solve an equation that has no solution.

The photograph sits on my desk, face-down. I can't look at it.

Because every time I do, I see what I'm about to lose—either Ethan, or my dreams, or maybe both.

And I have no idea which loss I can survive.

**What happens next:**

- Does Sophia tell Ethan about his father's ultimatum?
- What does she choose: MIT with the scholarship, or Ethan?
- Can they find a third option Robert Hayes didn't account for?
- Ethan leaves for Michigan in two days—what does their goodbye look like?
- And what will Robert do when he gets Sophia's answer?

**Episode 5 Preview:** The badminton nationals road trip becomes a storm-trapped crisis when Sophia's choice becomes public. Ethan finds out about his father's offer. Everything that's been building explodes. And the team bus breaking down in a blizzard is the least of their problems.

The countdown is on. The stakes have never been higher.

And sometimes, the right choice isn't the one that makes sense.

**See you in Episode 5.**
