## CRITICAL DIALOGUE ISSUES & REWRITES

### ISSUE #1: Too Articulate When Emotional

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 1, Line 380-381):**
> "Because I am. Because Jordan told me your parents are planning to separate us and I'm trying to make it easier. Because prep school is in three weeks and long distance doesn't work and you need to focus on hockey."

**REWRITE:**
> "Because I—Jordan said your parents are... I'm just trying to—" She stops, starts again. "You're leaving in three weeks. And long distance is... it doesn't work. You need to focus on hockey."

**Why it's better:** Shows emotional struggle through broken sentences, restarts, trailing off.

---

### ISSUE #2: Missing Teen Speech Patterns

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 1, Line 233):**
> "Okay. So picture it. There's a ladder, right? Twenty feet long."

**REWRITE:**
> "Okay, so like, picture this ladder thing. It's like twenty feet or whatever."

**Why it's better:** Adds "like" as filler, casual "or whatever," less formal structure.

---

### ISSUE #3: Text Messages Too Formal

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 1):**
> ETHAN: You okay? Jordan said you left in a hurry.
> ME: I'm fine. Just tired. Talk tomorrow?

**REWRITE:**
> ETHAN: u ok? jordan said u left kinda fast
> ME: yeah just tired
> ME: talk tmrw?

**Why it's better:** Actual teen texting style - lowercase, abbreviations, multiple quick messages.

---

### ISSUE #4: Tyler and Ethan Sound Identical

**ORIGINAL (Tyler, Chapter 1):**
> "Hey, thanks. I've been stuck on this for like an hour."

**ORIGINAL (Ethan, similar context):**
> "I don't understand what happened. Two weeks ago we were fine."

**REWRITE (Tyler - more casual/bro-ish):**
> "Yo, thanks. This stuff's been killing me for like an hour, no joke."

**REWRITE (Ethan - more intense/vulnerable):**
> "I don't—what happened? Two weeks ago everything was good. We were good."

---

### ISSUE #5: Parking Lot Confrontations Too Polished

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 2, Line 463):**
> "Sophia Chen, can I kiss you now? In front of all these families and the Christmas music and probably someone's grandmother?"

**REWRITE:**
> "Sophie—" He laughs nervously. "Can I just—in front of all these random families and someone's grandma and—can I kiss you now?"

**Why it's better:** More nervous energy, less rehearsed, natural stumbling.

---

### ISSUE #6: Missing Overlapping Dialogue

**ORIGINAL (Study group scene):**
> "Soph," Ethan says, standing at the edge of our table.
> "Hey." I keep my voice bright, friendly, distant. "How's your turkey sandwich?"
> "What?"
> "Your lunch. Is it good?"

**REWRITE:**
> "Soph," Ethan says, standing at the edge of our table.
> "Hey, how's your—"
> "Can we talk?"
> "—turkey sandwich? Is it good?"
> "My what?"

**Why it's better:** Shows interruption, miscommunication, realistic conversation collision.

---

### ISSUE #7: Too Much Emotional Eloquence

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 3, Line 357):**
> "I know my parents are problems. I know I'm leaving in less than two weeks. I know long distance is hard and we're both busy and there are approximately seven thousand reasons this is complicated."

**REWRITE:**
> "Look, I know my parents are—they're a problem. And I'm leaving in like, less than two weeks. And long distance is... it sucks, we both know it sucks. There's like a million reasons this is stupid."

---

### ISSUE #8: Missing Filler Words and False Starts

**ORIGINAL (Chapter 2):**
> "There's someone else. Not—I'm not seeing anyone else. But there's someone I have history with."

**REWRITE:**
> "There's... okay, so there's someone else. I mean—not like that, I'm not seeing—there's just this person I have, like, history with or whatever."

---

### ISSUE #9: Teen Group Dynamics Too Orderly

**ORIGINAL (Study group):**
> Everyone settles into working, the room going mostly quiet.

**REWRITE - Add overlapping conversations:**
> "Wait, what page—"
> "Forty-seven."
> "No, that's the—"
> "Oh my god, this calc problem—"
> "Shh, Jordan's mom—"
> "She's upstairs, chill."

---

### ISSUE #10: Physical Reactions Over Dialogue Tags

**ORIGINAL:**
> "I don't know," I say quietly.

**REWRITE:**
> "I don't know." I pick at the corner of my notebook, not looking at him.

---

## SPECIFIC LINE REWRITES (10-15 Examples)

### 1. Making Tyler More Distinct
**ORIGINAL:** "That's actually really cool."
**REWRITE:** "Okay, that's actually sick. Marine biology? Respect."

### 2. Sophia Less Composed
**ORIGINAL:** "I'm trying to do the right thing."
**REWRITE:** "I'm trying to—I don't know, do the right thing? Is that even a thing?"

### 3. Ethan More Vulnerable
**ORIGINAL:** "I miss you. I miss talking to you."
**REWRITE:** "I miss you. Like, stupid amounts. I miss just... talking."

### 4. Maya More Teen
**ORIGINAL:** "You're being weird with Ethan."
**REWRITE:** "Okay, you're being super weird with Ethan and it's literally painful to watch."

### 5. Group Conversation Chaos
**ORIGINAL:** "Did everyone finish the calculus homework?"
**REWRITE:** "Did everyone finish—" "No." "God no." "What homework?" "The derivative thing?" "There was homework?"

**REWRITE:** "I don't—I can't—how am I supposed to..."

### 7. Tyler's Graceful Exit (Too Graceful)

**REWRITE:** "Well. This is... yeah. Thanks for being honest, I guess?"

### 8. Robert Price Stays Formal (Good Example)
**KEEP:** "I'm investing in both of their futures."
This works - adults should sound different from teens.

### 9. Text Conversation More Realistic

**REWRITE:**
> "lemme think about it?"
> "like not no but"
> "just need to think"

### 10. Parking Lot Awkwardness

**ORIGINAL:** "I'm here for you."
**REWRITE:** "I got you. Like, whatever you need."

### 12. Confusion/Frustration
**ORIGINAL:** "I don't understand what's happening."

### 13. Happy/Excited
**ORIGINAL:** "This is great news!"
**REWRITE:** "Oh my god, shut up! This is insane! Like actually insane!"

### 14. Avoiding the Question
**ORIGINAL:** "I'd rather not discuss that."

## NATURAL SPEECH PATTERN GUIDE

### Teen Speech Characteristics to Add:
1. **Filler words:** like, literally, basically, actually, kinda, sorta
2. **Trailing off:** "I just thought..." "Maybe we could..."
3. **Restarts:** "I mean—wait, no, what I meant was..."
4. **Uptalk:** Ending statements with question intonation
5. **Intensifiers:** So, totally, completely, legit, for real
6. **Hedging:** "I guess," "or whatever," "I don't know"
7. **Tag questions:** "right?" "you know?" "yeah?"

### Emotional State Indicators:
- **Nervous:** More fillers, restarts, trailing off
- **Angry:** Shorter sentences, interrupting self
- **Happy:** Run-on sentences, jumping topics
- **Sad:** Quiet, minimal responses, long pauses
- **Confused:** Questions, repeating, "wait, what?"

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REVISION

### Priority 1: Character Voice Distinction
- Give Tyler more "bro" markers without making him dumb
- Make Ethan slightly less articulate than Sophia
- Add more filler words to everyone except Robert Price
- Give Jordan artistic observations/unique perspective

### Priority 2: Emotional Authenticity
- Break up sentences when characters are upset
- Add physical reactions instead of emotional declarations
- Show feelings through speech rhythm changes
- Less self-awareness in heated moments

### Priority 3: Natural Flow
- Add more interruptions
- Include overlapping dialogue in group scenes
- Use trail-offs and incomplete thoughts
- Show miscommunication and talking past each other

### Priority 4: Teen Authenticity
- Update text message formatting
- Add current slang sparingly but appropriately
- Include pop culture references
- Show code-switching between adults/peers

### Priority 5: Subtext Enhancement
- Have characters say the opposite of what they mean
- Use silence and refusal to answer
- Show tension through what's not said
- Build dramatic irony through misdirection

---

## FINAL NOTES

The dialogue has strong moments, particularly Robert Price's manipulative speech and some of Maya's sarcastic observations. However, the main characters need more distinct voices, and emotional scenes need to be messier and less articulate.

The story is compelling, but the dialogue often tells us how characters feel rather than showing us through authentic speech patterns. With the suggested revisions focusing on natural teen speech, distinct character voices, and messier emotional exchanges, the dialogue will feel more authentic and engaging.

Remember: Teens in crisis don't speak in complete sentences. They interrupt, trail off, restart, and say everything except what they really mean. That's where the truth lives—in the spaces between words.

---

**Dialogue Coach Signature Move:** Every character should have at least one speech pattern that's uniquely theirs. Sophia's physics metaphors work. Now give Ethan hockey metaphors, Tyler casual bro-speak, Maya pop culture snark, and Jordan artistic observations. Make them unmistakable even without tags.
