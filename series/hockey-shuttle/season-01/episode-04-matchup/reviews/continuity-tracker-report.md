---

## PART 1: CRITICAL CONTINUITY ERRORS

### 🚨 ERROR #1: ETHAN'S LAST NAME CHANGED MID-SERIES

**Severity: CRITICAL - Series-Breaking Error**

**Episodes 1-2 Canon:**
- Character name: Ethan **HAYES**
- Established consistently across ~36,000 words
- Referenced in dialogue, narration, character introductions
- His parents: Robert & Caroline **HAYES**

**Episodes 3-4 Canon:**
- Character name: Ethan **PRICE**
- Changed without explanation
- All references updated to Price
- His parents: Robert & Catherine **PRICE**

**Impact:**
- Readers binge-reading Episodes 1-4 will notice immediately
- Amazon reviews will call this out as sloppy editing
- Breaks immersion completely
- Makes the series look unprofessional

**Required Fix:**
- **MUST** standardize throughout entire series
- Recommend keeping **HAYES** (established first, used in 2 episodes)
- If changing to **PRICE**, must retroactively fix Episodes 1-2
- Choose ONE name and stick with it

**Lines Requiring Updates in Episode 4 (if keeping HAYES):**
- All instances of "Price" → "Hayes"
- All instances of "Robert Price" → "Robert Hayes"
- All instances of "Catherine Price" → "Caroline Hayes"
- Estimate: 100+ instances across 4 chapters

---

### 🚨 ERROR #2: TYLER CHARACTER IDENTITY CONFLICT

**Severity: CRITICAL - Character Continuity Break**

**Episode 1 Established Canon:**
- **Tyler Hayes** - Ethan's best friend since age 9
- Teammate on hockey team
- Same last name as Ethan (both Hayes)
- His mother is Mrs. Hayes, maternal figure to Ethan
- Deep friendship established in childhood

**Episode 4 Introduction:**
- **Tyler Kim** - Presented as NEW character
- Senior, defense position, hockey captain
- Going to UBC next year
- Korean-Canadian, wears Canucks hoodie
- Ethan introduces him to Sophia in Chapter 1 as if meeting for first time

**Contradiction:**
- Episode 1: Tyler is Ethan's childhood best friend (known since age 9)
- Episode 4: Tyler is introduced as if Sophia has never met him before
- If they're the same person, Sophia would already know Tyler from Episode 1
- If they're different people, where did original Tyler go?

**Episode 4 Chapter 1 Line:**
```
"Sophia, this is Tyler Kim. Defense, senior, going to UBC next year."
Tyler: friendly, genuine, mentions loving math
```

**This cannot be the same Tyler from Episode 1** because:
1. Different last name (Hayes vs. Kim)
2. Introduced as if meeting for first time
3. Different family background (Mrs. Hayes vs. Korean-Canadian)
4. Episode 1 Tyler was same age as Ethan (junior), this Tyler is senior

**Additional Confusion in Episode 4:**
Chapter 1 mentions "Tyler Chen" as part of study group:
```
"Tyler Chen says—different Tyler, not hockey Tyler, this is Tyler-who's-in-our-study-group"
```

This suggests awareness of multiple Tylers but doesn't resolve the Hayes/Kim issue.

**Impact:**
- Complete character continuity break
- Readers who remember Episode 1 will be confused
- "Where did Tyler Hayes go?"
- "Why is Ethan's best friend never mentioned?"

**Required Fix:**
- **Option A:** Make Tyler Kim a different person entirely, reference original Tyler Hayes in Episode 4
- **Option B:** Reconcile that Tyler Kim IS Tyler Hayes (name changed mid-series like Ethan's)
- **Option C:** Acknowledge Tyler Hayes exists separately and explain his absence

---

### 🚨 ERROR #3: MOTHER'S NAME INCONSISTENCY

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Episode 2 Canon:**
- Ethan's mother: **Caroline** Hayes
- Dinner scene at Hayes home
- Apple pie detail
- Formal, measuring personality

**Episodes 3-4 Canon:**
- Ethan's mother: **Catherine** Price
- Same personality traits
- No explanation for name change

**Required Fix:**
- Standardize to **CAROLINE** throughout
- Update Episode 3-4 references

---

### 🚨 ERROR #4: BECCA'S LAST NAME INCONSISTENCY

**Severity: MODERATE (character already exited by Ep 4)**

**Episode 1 Canon:**
- Becca **Martinez**
- Established as Ethan's girlfriend

**Episode 2 Canon:**
- Becca **Morrison**
- Same character, different last name

**Impact:**
- Less critical since Becca exits in Episode 3
- Still needs fixing for Episodes 1-2 consistency

**Required Fix:**
- Choose one last name (recommend **Martinez** - established first)
- Update Episode 2 references

---

## PART 2: TIMELINE VERIFICATION

### ✅ EPISODE 4 INTERNAL TIMELINE: ACCURATE

**Timeline as presented:**
- Late November (week after Episode 3)
- Early December (dates, study groups, winter formal)
- December 15: College applications due
- December 16: Winter formal
- Christmas Eve/Day
- New Year's Eve (December 31)
- January 2: Robert's visit with MIT offer

**Day-by-Day Verification:**

#### Week 1 (Late November):
- **Monday:** Sophia avoiding Ethan at school (Chapter 1)
- **Thursday lunch:** Ethan introduces Tyler Kim
- **Friday after school:** Tyler asks Sophia to winter formal
- **Friday night:** Hockey game, Ethan plays angry
- ✅ Timeline works

#### Week 2-3 (Early December):
- **Saturday, December 2:** First date with Tyler (coffee shop)
- **Wednesday evening:** Study group at Jordan's (awkward)
- **Thursday:** Badminton practice
- **Friday night:** Hockey game watching
- ✅ Timeline works

#### Week 3 (Mid-December):
- **December 15:** College applications due (MIT, Caltech, Cornell, Princeton)
- **Saturday, December 16:** Winter formal
- ✅ Timeline works

#### Christmas Week:
- **December 20 (Thursday):** Finals week ends
- **December 24 (Sunday):** Christmas Eve
- **December 25 (Monday):** Christmas Day
- ✅ Timeline works

#### New Year's Week:
- **December 28:** Originally scheduled prep school departure (mentioned in text)
- **December 31:** New Year's Eve party at Maya's
- **January 1:** New Year's Day
- **January 2:** Robert arrives with MIT offer
- **January 4:** New prep school departure date
- ✅ Timeline works

**PREP SCHOOL DATE CHANGE: ✅ EXPLAINED**
- Episode 3 established: December 28 departure
- Episode 4 Chapter 4 explains: "January 4th (pushed back from the 28th because of hockey playoffs)"
- This is properly acknowledged and explained within the text

### ⚠️ TIMELINE CONCERN: Regionals Date

**Episode 4 mentions:**
- Chapter 2: "Regionals are five weeks away" (said during early December)
- This would put regionals around **mid-January**

**Episode 4 Chapter 1 establishes:**
- "January twentieth" as regionals date

**Math check:**
- Early December + 5 weeks = ~January 6-13
- But stated date is January 20
- This is approximately 6-7 weeks, not 5

**Severity: MINOR** - easily fixed by changing "five weeks" to "six weeks"

## PART 8: SETUP FOR EPISODE 5

### THREADS REQUIRING RESOLUTION:

1. **MIT bribe decision**
   - 24-hour deadline (expires January 3)
   - What does Sophia choose?
   - **CRITICAL CLIFFHANGER** - must open Episode 5

2. **Does Sophia tell Ethan?**
   - He leaves January 4 (day after deadline)
   - Does he find out about his father's offer?
   - How does he react?
   - **CHARACTER AGENCY** - Ethan deserves to know

3. **Prep school departure**
   - January 4 (2 days after cliffhanger)
   - Do they have 2 days together or apart?
   - What is their goodbye like?
   - **EMOTIONAL PAYOFF REQUIRED**

#### 📅 NEAR-TERM (Should be addressed in Episodes 5-6):

1. **Badminton regionals** (January 20)
   - 18 days after cliffhanger
   - Will Sophia's emotional state affect performance?
   - Is this the nationals road trip mentioned in Episode 5 preview?

2. **Robert's reaction to Sophia's decision**
   - What happens when she accepts or rejects?
   - Does he escalate further?
   - What are consequences for Ethan?

---

## PART 9: SPECIFIC CONTINUITY QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS

### QUESTIONS FOR WRITER:

1. **Was the last name change intentional?**
   - Hayes → Price
   - If yes, why? Symbolic meaning?
   - If no, which name should be canon?

2. **What happened to Tyler Hayes?**
   - Ethan's childhood best friend
   - Why is he absent from Episodes 2-4?
   - Should he be referenced?

3. **Is Ethan aware of his mother's name change?**
   - Caroline → Catherine
   - (This is clearly an error, but asking anyway)

4. **Jordan's role moving forward:**
   - Episode 3: Warns Sophia about parents
   - Episode 4: Supports both
   - Does he maintain this mediator role?
   - What's his investment in their relationship?

5. **When does Sophia find out she got into MIT?**
   - Normal timeline: April admission results
   - Robert's offer: Immediate guaranteed admission
   - This timing matters for dramatic tension

6. **Ethan's engineering dreams:**
   - Should Episode 4 acknowledge irony that Sophia is offered MIT?
   - Does Ethan still want MIT/Caltech?
   - How does this affect his reaction to the bribe?

---

## PART 10: RECOMMENDED FIXES

### 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Must fix before publishing):

1. **Standardize Ethan's last name throughout series**
   - Recommend: **HAYES** (established first, used 2 episodes)
   - Required changes:
     - Episode 4: All "Price" → "Hayes" (100+ instances)
     - Episode 3: All "Price" → "Hayes" (if not already published)
   - Alternate: Keep "Price" but retroactively fix Episodes 1-2

2. **Resolve Tyler character conflict**
   - **Option A (Recommended):** Tyler Kim is entirely new character
     - Add line in Episode 4 explaining Tyler Hayes' absence
     - Example: "Not Tyler Hayes, Ethan's best friend from freshman year. Different Tyler."
   - **Option B:** Combine characters (less recommended)
     - Make Tyler Kim actually be Tyler Hayes (Korean heritage added)
     - Explain why Sophia didn't recognize him initially
     - Requires significant Episode 1 rewrites

3. **Standardize mother's name**
   - Recommend: **CAROLINE** Hayes (used in Episode 2)
   - Update Episode 3-4 references
   - Estimated: 20-30 instances

4. **Fix Becca's last name**
   - Recommend: **MARTINEZ** (established in Episode 1)
   - Update Episode 2 references
   - Less critical (character exited), but should be fixed

### ⚠️ MODERATE PRIORITY (Should fix for consistency):

5. **Clarify regionals timeline**
   - Chapter 2: "five weeks away" → change to "six weeks away"
   - Makes January 20 date accurate

6. **Add Tyler Hayes reference**
   - One line acknowledging original best friend still exists
   - Explains his absence (graduated? different school? moved?)
   - Maintains Episode 1 continuity

7. **Acknowledge Ethan's MIT dreams**
   - Add line in Chapter 4 about irony of Sophia being offered his dream school
   - Could be internal monologue from Sophia
   - Deepens emotional complexity

### ✅ MINOR (Nice to have):

8. **Mrs. Hayes reference**
   - One line mentioning Tyler Hayes' mom
   - Shows continuity with Episode 1
   - Not critical but thoughtful

9. **Jordan's art studio callback**
   - Small reference to Halloween party location
   - "Where we almost kissed before your dad showed up"
   - Deepens their history

10. **The Forks seasonal contrast**
    - Episode 1: Autumn
    - Episode 4: Frozen winter
    - Could add poetic observation about change

## CONCLUSION

**Episode 4 "Matchup" is well-written, emotionally compelling, and internally consistent.** The romantic progression is earned, the new character (Tyler Kim) is sympathetic and well-executed, and the cliffhanger is genuinely gripping.

**HOWEVER**, the episode contains **series-breaking continuity errors** that would immediately be noticed by readers binge-reading Episodes 1-4. Character names changing mid-series looks unprofessional and breaks reader trust.

**These are easily fixable errors** - mostly find-and-replace operations - but they are CRITICAL to fix before Episode 4 is published.

With the recommended fixes applied, Episode 4 would be a strong entry in the series with excellent emotional payoff and compelling setup for Episode 5.
