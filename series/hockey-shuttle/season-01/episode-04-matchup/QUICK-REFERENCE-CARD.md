- **Ethan HAYES** (not Price)
- **Robert HAYES** (not Price)
- **Caroline HAYES** (not Catherine)
- **Tyler KIM** or rename to **Derek KIM**
- **Becca MARTINEZ** (not Morrison)

- [ ] Tyler identity clarification

**TYLER/DEREK**: Casual bro-energy, "dude," "sick"
**MAYA**: Sarcastic, direct, "literally," pop culture
**JORDAN**: Quiet observer, artistic references
**ROBERT**: Formal, sophisticated, never uses slang
