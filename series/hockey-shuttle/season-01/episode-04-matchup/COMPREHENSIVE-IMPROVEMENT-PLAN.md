   New Scene (200 words):

   I'm about to text Ethan back when I see it—his parents' Mercedes in the parking lot.
   Through the fogged window, I can see Robert Hayes on his phone, and he's looking
   right at me. He doesn't wave. Doesn't acknowledge. Just watches as I sit in my car,
   crying, clearly having fought with his son.

   Then he smiles. Not a kind smile. A satisfied one.

   That's when I understand—they've been watching us. Waiting for cracks. And I just
   showed them exactly where to apply pressure.

   I delete my half-typed response to Ethan. If I tell him his dad saw me crying,
   he'll confront him. He'll blow everything up right before leaving for prep school.
   He'll destroy his future trying to protect something that might not even survive
   the distance.

   I can't let that happen.

   I should tell Ethan right now. Call him, text him, anything.

   But I know exactly what will happen. He'll storm over to his parents' house.
   He'll burn every bridge, refuse prep school, probably get disowned. He'll
   throw away thirteen years of hockey development, his entire future, for me.

   And in five years, when the romance has faded but the consequences haven't,
   he'll resent me for it. We'll become one of those couples who stay together
   out of obligation because one person sacrificed everything.

   I can't be the reason he destroys his life. I have to make this choice alone.

## ROMANCE AMPLIFICATION GUIDE

### The First Kiss Enhancement

**Current Version**: Quick, sweet, moves on
**Enhanced Version**:
```
"Sophia Chen," he says, and his voice catches on my name like it's sacred.

The world narrows to just this—our breath making clouds in the frigid air,
mixing and dissipating like all the words we're not saying. His eyes are
that impossible blue that started this whole thing, but darker now, pupils
blown wide. His thumb traces my jaw and I shiver, but not from the cold.

"Can I kiss you now?" The question is barely a whisper.

I can't speak. I just nod, already rising on my toes, already leaning in.

He meets me halfway, and the first touch of his lips is so gentle I might
cry. Then his hand slides into my hair and he deepens the kiss and I make
a sound I've never made before—something between a sigh and a prayer.

He tastes like hot chocolate and winter and home. His other arm wraps around
my waist, pulling me closer, and I grab his coat like I'm drowning and he's
the only solid thing in the world.

When we finally break apart, we're both breathing hard, grinning like idiots.
My lips feel swollen, electric. I can still taste him.

"Worth eight years of waiting?" I manage.

"Worth everything," he says, and kisses me again.
```

## CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS

Episode 4 succeeds when:
1. ✓ Character names are 100% consistent
2. ✓ Readers understand why Sophia doesn't tell Ethan
3. ✓ Teens feel authentically 2024-2025
4. ✓ First kiss makes readers swoon
5. ✓ Cliffhanger compels immediate Episode 5 reading
6. ✓ Romance has appropriate heat for YA
7. ✓ Dialogue sounds natural, not scripted
8. ✓ Setting feels viscerally Winnipeg winter

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN:

**Day 1 (4-6 hours):**
- Fix all character names
- Add witness scene
- Add reasoning for silence
- Basic social media integration

**Day 2 (4-6 hours):**
- Dialogue naturalness pass
- Romance amplification
- Chapter 2 pacing fixes
- Cliffhanger sharpening

**Day 3 (4-6 hours):**
- World-building sensory details
- Contemporary authenticity updates
- Supporting character moments
- Final polish

**TOTAL REVISION TIME: 12-18 hours for complete improvement**

---

## CONCLUSION

Episode 4 has strong emotional bones and compelling story architecture, but requires significant revision before publication. The character name inconsistencies alone would destroy reader trust and generate negative reviews.

With the recommended fixes—particularly the critical P0 items—Episode 4 can transform from a problematic draft to a compelling, authentic episode that delivers on both romantic and dramatic promises while maintaining series continuity.

**RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT publish without completing at minimum all P0 fixes. Ideally complete P0 and P1 fixes for a quality episode that will satisfy readers and maintain series momentum.**
