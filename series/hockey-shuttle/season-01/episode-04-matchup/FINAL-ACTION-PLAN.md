# FINAL ACTION PLAN: EPISODE 4 REVISION
## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

**Episode**: S01E04 "Matchup"
**Current Status**: CRITICAL REVISIONS REQUIRED
**Estimated Total Time**: 12-16 hours
**Priority**: DO NOT PUBLISH WITHOUT P0 FIXES

---

## STEP 1: EMERGENCY FIXES (2 Hours) 🚨
**These MUST be done before ANY publication**

### Hour 1: Character Name Standardization
1. Open Episode 4 in your editor
2. Run Find & Replace:
   - "Ethan Price" → "Ethan Hayes"
   - "Robert Price" → "Robert Hayes"
   - "Catherine Price" → "Caroline Hayes"
   - "Price" → "Hayes" (check each instance)
3. Verify Episodes 1-2 use Hayes consistently
4. Add line when Tyler Kim is introduced: "Not Tyler Hayes from middle school—different Tyler"
   - Alternative: Rename Tyler Kim to Derek Kim throughout

### Hour 2: Critical Story Logic
1. Add THE WITNESS SCENE after parking lot (Chapter 2)
   - Copy from KEY-SCENE-REWRITES.md
   - This explains why Sophia doesn't tell Ethan
2. Add internal monologue in Chapter 4:
   - After Robert leaves, add Sophia's reasoning
   - "If I tell him, he'll destroy his future for me"
3. Add prep school date clarification (Chapter 1):
   - "January 4th—pushed back from December 28th due to playoffs"

✅ **Checkpoint**: Story now makes logical sense

1. More phone checking/scrolling
