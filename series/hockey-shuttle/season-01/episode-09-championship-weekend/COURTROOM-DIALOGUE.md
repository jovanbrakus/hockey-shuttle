## ROBERT PRICE - OPENING STATEMENT

**Attorney Wilson**: "Mr. Price, please tell the court about your son's hockey career."

**Robert**: "Thirteen years. That's how long we've dedicated to building Ethan's future. When he was four, Caroline and I saw something special. Not just talent—drive. Focus. The kind of dedication that makes champions.

We moved to Madison when he was nine so he could train with the AAA program. Left our home, our friends, everything. Caroline took a lower-paying job. I coached youth hockey on weekends just to stay involved. We weren't pushing him. He wanted this. Every morning, six AM practice, he was up before his alarm.

The coaches said he could go pro. Not maybe—could. NHL scouts have been watching since he was fifteen. This year alone, three teams contacted us about the draft. Three, Your Honor. Do you know what those odds are? One in thousands.

And now he wants to walk away. Not for himself—he told me that much. For engineering school. For MIT. And I'm supposed to believe that after one year back in touch with—"

*He stops himself, regroups.*

"Your Honor, I'm not the villain here. I know how this looks. Controlling father, won't let go. But I've watched Ethan make decisions his entire life. Clear, focused decisions. He chose hockey. He chose the early mornings, the sacrifices, the discipline. This choice? This is different. This is rushed.

He's seventeen. Brilliant, yes. Mature, absolutely. But seventeen. And he's making a decision that closes doors he can't reopen. You don't get to be an NHL prospect twice. You don't get those years back.

I love my son. Everything I've done has been for him. I just need him to wait. One more year. Graduate. See if he still feels this way when he's not... when he's had time to think clearly.

I'm not trying to control his life. I'm trying to protect his future. That's what fathers do."

## ETHAN PRICE - TESTIMONY

**Attorney Martinez** (Ethan's lawyer): "Ethan, why are you seeking emancipation?"

**Ethan**: "Because I need to make my own choices about my future. Not because my parents' choices are wrong. Because they're not mine."

**Martinez**: "Can you elaborate?"

**Ethan**: "When I was four, I loved hockey. Loved skating, loved the game. My dad saw that and helped me get better. We moved to Madison, trained with AAA, and I got really good. Great, actually. And I thought that meant it was my path.

But somewhere along the way, hockey stopped being what I loved and started being what I was supposed to love. The plan. The future. The dream we'd built together.

I'm not throwing anything away, Your Honor. I'm choosing something different. I've always loved math. Science. Building things. When I was twelve, I used to calculate trajectory angles for slap shots just because it was fun. Not for hockey. Just because I wanted to understand how force and velocity worked.

Last year, Sophia moved back to Madison. We knew each other as kids. And she was doing things I'd forgotten I cared about. Science olympiad. Math competitions. Building robots. She wasn't trying to change me. She was just being herself. And I remembered I used to be like that too.

I started entering competitions again. I won gold at the state science olympiad. I got recruited for MIT—full scholarship. Not because of hockey. Because of engineering.

My parents think I'm choosing this because of Sophia. They're wrong. I'm choosing this because for the first time in years, I'm excited about waking up for something other than practice. I want to build things. Design systems. Solve problems that matter.

I'm grateful for everything they've given me. The discipline. The work ethic. The focus. Those things came from hockey. But they don't belong to hockey. They're mine now. And I want to use them differently.

I'm not rejecting my parents. I'm not running away. I'm asking for the right to choose my own path. I'm seventeen. In one year, I'll have that right automatically. But MIT won't wait. This opportunity won't wait.

I've proven I can make good decisions. I've maintained straight A's while training twenty hours a week. I've managed my time, my priorities, my goals. I'm not impulsive. I'm not reckless. I'm just different from who my father planned for me to be.

And that should be okay."

**Martinez**: "What about the NHL scouts? The draft?"

**Ethan**: "They're scouting someone I'm not anymore. Someone I don't want to be. That's not me throwing something away. That's me being honest about who I am."

**Judge Morrison**: "What about Sophia Chen? Your parents claim this decision is based on teenage infatuation."

**Ethan**: "Sophia is important to me. I won't pretend she's not. But she's not why I'm here. She chose MIT months before I did. She chose engineering her whole life. She doesn't need me to validate her choices.

And I don't need her to validate mine. I need you to see that I'm capable of making them. That I understand what I'm giving up and what I'm choosing instead. That's not infatuation. That's self-awareness."

## DR. MARTINEZ TESTIMONY (Clinical Psychologist)

**Attorney Martinez**: "Dr. Martinez, please share your evaluation findings."

**Dr. Martinez**: "I conducted a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation of Ethan Price over three sessions. Standard protocol for emancipation cases—cognitive assessment, emotional maturity indicators, decision-making capacity, and susceptibility to external influence.

Ethan scored in the ninety-eighth percentile for emotional intelligence and self-awareness. His responses showed clear understanding of both short and long-term consequences. When asked about alternative scenarios—what if MIT doesn't work, what if the relationship ends, what if he regrets leaving hockey—his answers were thoughtful and reality-based.

I also assessed for signs of manipulation or unhealthy attachment. Found none. His relationship with Sophia Chen appears to be between peers of equal agency and achievement. He doesn't idealize her or show dependence markers. When asked to imagine his future without her, he described the same academic and career goals.

Most significantly, Ethan demonstrated understanding of what he's leaving behind. He's not minimizing the NHL opportunity. He's actively choosing against it with full awareness. That's the key distinction. This isn't denial. It's preference.

In twenty years of evaluating minors, Ethan is among the most emotionally mature seventeen-year-olds I've assessed. He's not running from something. He's running toward something. And he knows the difference.

My professional recommendation is that emancipation proceed. This young man has the capacity to make informed decisions about his future. Whether those decisions are what his parents would choose is irrelevant to the legal standard."

## MICHAEL CHEN TESTIMONY (MIT Faculty, Sophia's Uncle)

**Attorney Martinez**: "Professor Chen, please describe MIT's offer to Ethan."

**Professor Chen**: "MIT doesn't extend offers lightly. Ethan's application was extraordinary. Gold medal at state science olympiad. First place at regional math competition. Original research on kinetic energy transfer in collision systems—inspired by hockey, ironically. His essay on applying sports analytics to engineering problems showed creative thinking we rarely see.

The scholarship is full—tuition, housing, stipends. Contingent on emancipated status or parental financial disclosure. The Prices declined to provide financial information. So emancipation became necessary.

I need to be clear. I'm Sophia's uncle. I'm aware people will assume bias. But I didn't recruit Ethan. I didn't know about their... connection until after his acceptance. MIT accepted him on merit. Period.

We have seventeen thousand applicants for fifteen hundred spots. Ethan earned his.

Additionally, I've reviewed his financial plan. His savings from hockey tournament prizes and endorsement deals, combined with scholarship stipends and work-study, provide viable independent living. He's not walking into this blind. He's calculated it. Literally—I've seen the spreadsheet."

**Judge Morrison**: "Do you believe he's prepared for this?"

**Professor Chen**: "Yes. Academically, absolutely. Emotionally, I can't say. But I've seen hundreds of students navigate independence. Ethan has better preparation than most. And if he fails? He'll learn. That's what college is for."

## SOPHIA CHEN TESTIMONY

**Attorney Martinez**: "Sophia, how would you characterize your relationship with Ethan?"

**Sophia**: "Complicated."

*Light laughter in courtroom.*

"We grew up together. Sort of. Same skating rink when we were little. Then his family moved, I switched to badminton, and we lost touch for six years.

When I moved to Madison last year, he was the only person I knew. We became friends again. Then more than friends. And everyone acts like that's suspicious. Like I manipulated him or he's making bad choices because of me.

But here's what actually happened. I was doing science olympiad. He got curious. I wasn't trying to recruit him—I was just doing my thing. He joined because he wanted to. He won gold because he's brilliant. Not because of me. Because of himself.

I didn't make him choose MIT. I chose MIT first. Months before he did. And when he told me he was thinking about it, I told him not to do it for me. I told him to be sure. Because if he wasn't sure, if he blamed me later, that would break us.

I'm not on trial here, but it feels like I am. Like I'm the reason he's throwing his life away. But I'm a national badminton champion. I'm valedictorian. I got into MIT on my own merit. I don't need Ethan to be successful. And he doesn't need me.

What we have is partnership. We make each other better. We challenge each other. When I lost semifinals at nationals two weeks ago, he drove six hours to bring me ice cream and tell me I was still brilliant. When he doubts himself, I remind him what he's capable of.

That's not manipulation. That's not unhealthy dependence. That's what people who care about each other do.

I'm not asking you to approve of our relationship. I'm asking you to see that Ethan is his own person. With his own goals. His own dreams. And they're not less valid because they're different from what his parents wanted.

He's not choosing me over hockey. He's choosing himself. And I'm just lucky I get to be part of that."

**Judge Morrison**: "What happens if you two break up?"

**Sophia**: "Then we break up. And he'll still want to be an engineer. Because that's who he is. Not who I made him."

## JUDGE MORRISON - RULING

**Judge Morrison**: "I've reviewed all testimony and evidence. This is not an easy decision.

Mr. and Mrs. Price, I want you to hear this clearly. You are not bad parents. The sacrifices you've made for your son are extraordinary. The love you have for him is evident. Your fears about this decision are understandable. Most parents would feel the same.

But emancipation is not about whether parents have failed. It's about whether a minor has demonstrated capacity for independent decision-making and self-sufficiency.

Ethan Price has met the legal standard. He has stable financial support through scholarship and savings. He has demonstrated emotional maturity through Dr. Martinez's evaluation. He has been accepted to one of the world's finest universities based on his own merit. He has articulated clear, well-reasoned goals for his future.

The court is not here to judge whether his choice is right. Only whether he has the capacity to make it. And I believe he does.

This young man knows his mind. He understands consequences. He's not running from responsibility—he's running toward it. Just not the responsibility you envisioned for him.

Emancipation is granted, effective immediately. Ethan, you're free to accept MIT's offer and make your own choices. That freedom comes with weight. Remember that.

Mr. and Mrs. Price, I hope in time you'll see that this isn't rejection. It's independence. The goal of parenting is to raise adults who can stand on their own. You've succeeded. This just isn't what you thought success would look like.

Court adjourned."

## POST-RULING - HALLWAY SCENE

*Outside courtroom. Robert and Caroline stand separate from Ethan. Neither approaches. After a long moment:*

**Robert**: "I hope you're right about this."

**Ethan**: "Me too."

*Robert nods. Doesn't extend a hand. Turns and walks away with Caroline. She looks back once. Almost says something. Doesn't.*

*Sophia appears from the gallery. Stands beside Ethan but doesn't touch. Knows this moment is his alone.*

**Ethan**: "I'm free."

**Sophia**: "You're free."

**Ethan**: "Now what?"

**Sophia**: "Now we finish the season. You have a championship game in three hours. I have a makeup tournament tomorrow. And then we have our whole lives."

**Ethan**: "Together?"

**Sophia**: "If you want."

**Ethan**: "I want."

*She takes his hand. They walk toward the exit. Toward the rest of their lives. Toward MIT. Toward everything they chose.*

**END COURTROOM DIALOGUE**

*This dialogue feeds directly into Chapter 2's emotional resolution and sets up the championship game where THE KISS happens. Every testimony should feel earned, authentic, and true to character voice.*
