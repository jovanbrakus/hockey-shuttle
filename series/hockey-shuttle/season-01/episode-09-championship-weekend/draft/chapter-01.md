# CHAPTER 1: THE WAIT
## 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM

---

Sophia's alarm went off at six AM, the harsh buzz cutting through the pre-dawn quiet of her room. She hadn't slept.

May 15th.

Her stomach twisted immediately, the same sick feeling that had been her constant companion for six weeks. But today was different. Today was the day.

She reached over and silenced her phone, staring at the ceiling of her bedroom. Seventeen years old. Senior in high school. Possibly about to be charged with a crime for falling in love.

The absurdity of it should have been funny. Instead, it was terrifying.

A knock on her door, soft. "Sweetie? You awake?"

"Yeah, Mom. I'm up."

Her mother opened the door, already dressed. Michelle Chen looked like she hadn't slept either. The past six weeks had aged both her parents—new lines around her eyes, gray hairs she hadn't bothered to color, an exhaustion that went bone-deep.

"I made breakfast. You need to eat."

"I'm not hungry."

"I know. You're eating anyway." Mom's voice was gentle but firm. "Long day ahead. You need strength."

Sophia sat up, pulling her knees to her chest. "What if they charge me, Mom?"

Michelle crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, pulling Sophia into a hug that smelled like her mother's lavender shampoo and coffee and home. "Then we fight it. Lisa says they won't. She says it's a bluff."

"But what if she's wrong?"

"Then we fight it," Mom repeated. "And we win. Because what you and Ethan did was not a crime. It was not wrong. And no judge will say it was."

Sophia wanted to believe that. She'd spent six weeks trying to believe it. Six weeks since April 1st, when police showed up at her university badminton practice and arrested her in front of the entire team. Six weeks since Robert Price filed charges claiming she'd manipulated his seventeen-year-old son into abandoning his hockey future for her.

Six weeks since she'd seen Ethan.

No—that wasn't quite true. She'd seen him. At the preliminary hearing. At the legal proceedings. Across courthouse hallways and through glass windows of meeting rooms. But they couldn't touch. Lisa Huang had been adamant: any contact during the legal proceedings could be used against them. No touching. No talking except in official capacities. Nothing that Robert's lawyers could twist into evidence of manipulation or coercion.

So for six weeks, they'd only had text messages. Carefully worded, always aware that Robert was probably monitoring Ethan's phone. Brief words of support that said everything and nothing.

*Thinking of you. Stay strong.*

*I love you. Today's hard but we'll make it.*

*Not much longer now. May 15th.*

May 15th. Today.

Sophia hugged her mother tighter. "I'm scared."

"I know, baby. I know. Me too." Michelle pulled back, holding Sophia's face in both hands. "But you are the bravest person I know. You stood up for what was right. You refused to let Robert Price control you. And today, we finish this."

"And if I end up with a criminal record—"

"You won't."

"But if I do, MIT—"

"Will still want you. Lisa already contacted them. They're on our side." Michelle smiled, fierce and protective. "The entire academic community is on our side. Nobody thinks loving someone eleven months younger than you is a crime."

Sophia took a shaky breath. "Okay. Okay, I'll come eat breakfast."

"Good girl." Michelle stood up. "Maya's already here, by the way. She brought reinforcements."

"Reinforcements?"

"You'll see."

---

Downstairs, Sophia found Maya sitting at the kitchen table with what looked like an entire bakery spread out in front of her. Croissants, muffins, donuts, breakfast sandwiches, and several thermoses of what smelled like very expensive coffee.

"Whoa."

Maya looked up, her expression fierce and determined. Her younger sister had always been protective, but the past six weeks had turned her into a warrior. "You need options. I don't know what you can eat when you're stressed, so I got everything."

Sophia felt tears prick her eyes. "Maya—"

"Don't cry yet. Save the crying for when we win." Maya stood up and pulled Sophia into a hug. "Today's the day we destroy Robert Price's bullshit legal theater. Today's the day you get your boyfriend back. Today's the day everything goes back to normal."

"Or I get charged with a crime."

"Not happening." Maya's voice was absolute certainty. "Lisa says it's a bluff, and Lisa hasn't been wrong yet. Robert's trying to scare you into dropping Ethan. He's banking on you being terrified enough to walk away. But you're not going to do that, are you?"

Sophia looked at the breakfast spread, at her sister's fierce eyes, at her parents hovering anxiously in the kitchen doorway. She thought about Ethan—brilliant, sweet, controlled for seventeen years by a father who saw him as property instead of a person.

"No," Sophia said quietly. "I'm not walking away."

"Damn right you're not." Maya pushed her toward a chair. "Now eat. We've got a legal battle to win."

Sophia managed half a croissant and some coffee. Her father sat next to her, reviewing their strategy for the hundredth time. Thomas Chen was an accountant, methodical and careful, and he'd approached Sophia's legal defense the same way he approached tax returns—with exhaustive preparation.

"Criminal charges hearing is at nine AM," Dad said, checking his notes. "Lisa will meet us at the courthouse at eight. The prosecution has until nine AM to proceed or drop charges. If you don't publicly recant your relationship with Ethan by then, they can move forward."

"Which I'm not doing." Sophia's voice was steady.

"Which you're not doing," Dad agreed. "Lisa believes they'll drop it. The law is technically on their side—you were eighteen, he was seventeen, that's illegal in Manitoba—but practically, no prosecutor wants to take this to trial. Too much bad publicity. The optics of charging a young woman for dating someone eleven months younger are terrible."

"Unless Robert's paying them enough not to care about optics," Maya muttered.

"He's not paying the prosecution," Mom said. "He's paying for media coverage. Those protesters outside the courthouse? Hired. The 'concerned parents' giving interviews about 'protecting children from predatory relationships'? Robert's PR team."

Sophia felt sick again. For six weeks, she'd watched the media coverage. Half the news outlets framed it as "teenage romance" and "overreaching parent." The other half framed it as "age gap relationship" and "questions of coercion." Reading the comments sections had been masochistic—people who didn't know her, didn't know Ethan, making judgments about their relationship, their choices, their lives.

"Don't read the comments," Maya had told her a hundred times.

Sophia had read them anyway.

*She groomed him. Age gap relationships are always about power.*

*He's a child. She took advantage.*

*If the genders were reversed, everyone would see this as predatory.*

*This is a teenage boy and his childhood friend. Get over yourselves.*

*17 and 18 is not grooming, it's high school.*

*She destroyed his hockey career for a relationship that won't last a year.*

That last comment haunted her. Not because she thought Ethan would leave her—she knew he wouldn't—but because of the assumption embedded in it. That hockey was Ethan's "real" future. That MIT was just a girl's influence. That his choices weren't actually his own.

Which was exactly what Robert wanted everyone to believe.

"Soph?" Maya's voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Sorry. Just thinking."

"Stop thinking. Eat."

Sophia forced down another bite of croissant. It tasted like cardboard, but Maya was right—she needed strength. Whatever happened today, she needed to be ready.

At seven AM, she went upstairs to get dressed. The question of what to wear to possibly be charged with a crime had haunted her for days. Too casual seemed disrespectful. Too formal seemed like she was trying too hard. In the end, she settled on dark jeans, a simple blue blouse, and the blazer her mother had bought her for university interviews. Professional but still herself.

She stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. Seventeen years old. Five-foot-four. Black hair pulled back in a neat ponytail. She looked tired—six weeks of stress and inadequate sleep showed in the shadows under her eyes, the tension in her jaw, the way her collarbones were more prominent than usual.

She looked like someone who'd been fighting a legal battle while trying to finish her senior year of high school.

Because that's exactly what she was.

"You can do this," she told her reflection. "You're not backing down. Not today. Not ever."

Her reflection stared back, scared but determined.

---

Across Winnipeg, in a hotel room that smelled like cheap coffee and Jordan's Axe body spray, Ethan Price was staring at his own reflection with similar determination and similar fear.

He hadn't slept either.

Jordan had smuggled him into the hotel last night—checking in under his own name, sneaking Ethan in through a side entrance, making sure nobody saw them. Robert didn't know Ethan was in Winnipeg yet. He thought Ethan was still in Brandon, still under house arrest, still controllable.

He was going to be very surprised when Ethan showed up at the courthouse.

"Dude, you need to eat something." Jordan tossed him a protein bar from the pile he'd brought last night. "Can't fight legal battles on an empty stomach."

Ethan caught the bar but just stared at it. His stomach was twisted in knots that made eating seem impossible. "I'm not hungry."

"Yeah, well, you're eating anyway." Jordan sat down on the other hotel bed, watching him carefully. "Big day. Charges hearing at nine, emancipation hearing at ten. Either Robert wins and you're stuck under his control for three more months, or you win and you're free."

"And Sophia either gets charged with a crime or she doesn't."

"She won't. Lisa says it's a bluff."

"But what if it's not?" Ethan ran his hands through his hair, anxiety making him restless. "What if they charge her because of me? What if my dad actually destroys her life—"

"Stop." Jordan's voice was firm. "Stop catastrophizing. Lisa Huang is the best defense attorney in Manitoba. Michael Chen wouldn't have recommended her if she wasn't. She says they'll drop charges. They'll drop charges."

Ethan wanted to believe that. He'd spent six weeks in a state of constant guilt and rage—guilt that Sophia was facing criminal charges because of him, rage at his father for filing them in the first place.

April 1st. The day that split his life into before and after.

He'd made his choice—chosen MIT over professional hockey, chosen his own future over his father's plans, chosen Sophia over Robert's control. He'd thought the worst had already happened. Screaming arguments. His father tracking his phone, deleting his texts, monitoring his every move. Moving back to Brandon and being forbidden from seeing Sophia.

Then April 1st happened.

Ethan had been in Brandon, finishing his online classes, when his mother called. Her voice had been strange—strained and careful in a way that immediately set off alarms.

"Ethan, your father filed charges against Sophia."

For a moment, he hadn't understood. "What kind of charges?"

"Criminal charges. For the relationship. The age gap." Caroline's voice had been thick with tears. "He says she manipulated you. That she's an adult in a relationship with a minor. That it's illegal."

The bottom had dropped out of Ethan's world.

"That's insane. She didn't manipulate me. She's only eleven months older—"

"I know. I know, honey. But technically, in Manitoba, it is illegal. She's eighteen and you're seventeen. Your father is using that."

"To do what?" But Ethan had known. Even before his mother answered, he'd known exactly what Robert was doing.

"To force you to break up with her. If she doesn't recant the relationship publicly, he's pushing for prosecution. If she does recant, if she agrees to never see you again, he'll drop it."

Ethan had sat in his Brandon house—the house that wasn't home, had never been home—and felt rage so complete it had made his vision white.

His father was using the law as a weapon. Using Sophia's love for Ethan against her. Threatening her with prison unless she walked away.

And knowing that Ethan, if given the choice between his future with Sophia and her freedom, would choose her freedom every time.

It was manipulation on a scale that took Ethan's breath away.

"I'm getting emancipated," he'd told his mother. "Right now. Today. Call Michael Chen. File the paperwork."

"Ethan—"

"Now, Mom. I'm not letting Dad do this. I'm not letting him control me or hurt Sophia anymore. I'm getting emancipated and then I'm going to testify that she never manipulated me, never coerced me, never did anything except support my choices."

There had been a long silence. Then, quietly, "Okay. I'll call Michael. We'll file the paperwork."

That was six weeks ago.

Six weeks of legal proceedings. Preliminary hearings. Psychological evaluations. Financial assessments. Character witnesses. Building a case for emancipation while simultaneously defending Sophia against criminal charges that should never have been filed.

Six weeks of not being able to see her. Talk to her except through carefully worded texts. Touch her.

Six weeks of his father's smug certainty that Sophia would break, would recant, would walk away to protect herself.

Robert Price didn't understand Sophia Chen at all.

She wasn't walking away. And neither was Ethan.

"You ready for this?" Jordan asked, watching him carefully.

Ethan pulled on the only suit he owned—the same one he'd worn to university interviews, back when his father still thought he could control which schools Ethan applied to. Navy blue, slightly too tight in the shoulders from hockey training, but professional enough.

"Yeah," Ethan said. "I'm ready. Let's go destroy my father's legal manipulation and get me emancipated."

Jordan grinned. "That's the spirit. Also, after today? You're free. Legally free. No more Robert controlling your life."

"If we win."

"When we win," Jordan corrected. "Think positive, man. You've got right on your side. And you've got the best lawyer in Winnipeg building your emancipation case. Robert's got money and anger and control issues. Guess which one the judge is going to side with?"

Ethan took a shaky breath. "Okay. Okay, let's do this."

They loaded into Jordan's car at seven-thirty. The drive across Winnipeg felt both endless and too fast. Ethan stared out the window, watching the city wake up—people going to work, to school, to normal Thursday activities. None of them knew that today was the day that determined his entire future.

"You think she's scared?" Ethan asked quietly.

Jordan didn't need to ask who "she" was. "Yeah, man. Probably terrified. You're probably both terrified. But you're both tough as hell, so you'll get through it."

"If they charge her—"

"They won't."

"But if they do, it's my fault. She's facing criminal charges because of me."

"No," Jordan said firmly. "She's facing criminal charges because your father is an abusive asshole who's weaponizing the legal system. That's not your fault. That's his."

Ethan knew Jordan was right. Intellectually, he knew that. Emotionally, the guilt still sat like lead in his stomach.

"I haven't seen her in six weeks," he said quietly. "Haven't touched her. Haven't talked to her except through texts that we both know my father is monitoring."

"Today you will. After the hearings, you're emancipated and the charges are dropped and you can actually be together." Jordan glanced over at him. "Just a few more hours, man. Hold on."

A few more hours. Ethan could do that. He'd survived seventeen years of his father's control. He'd survived six weeks of separation. He could survive a few more hours.

And then he'd be free.

---

At seven forty-five, both families arrived at the Winnipeg courthouse from different directions.

The scene was chaos.

Protesters lined the courthouse steps with signs: "PROTECT PARENTAL RIGHTS" and "CHILDREN NEED FATHERS" and "STOP AGE GAP ABUSE." Robert's hired PR campaign, obvious and performative. News cameras filming everything. Reporters trying to shove microphones at anyone who looked like they might be involved in the case.

Sophia's family came through the side entrance, trying to avoid the worst of it. But cameras still caught them—Sophia in the middle, flanked by her parents and Maya, all of them looking exhausted and determined.

"Ms. Chen! Do you regret the relationship?"

"Sophia! Will you recant today?"

"Is it true you manipulated Ethan Price into abandoning hockey?"

Michelle Chen put herself between the cameras and her daughter. "No comment. Please respect our privacy."

They pushed through to the courthouse doors, security letting them through after ID checks. Inside, the courthouse was marginally quieter—still busy with morning proceedings, but at least the media couldn't follow them past security.

"I hate this," Sophia muttered. "I hate all of this."

"Just a few more hours," Dad said, echoing Jordan's words to Ethan across the city. "Stay strong."

Across the courthouse lobby, Ethan and Jordan were running the same gauntlet. The protesters were louder for Ethan—"UNGRATEFUL SON" and "HOCKEY OVER HORMONES" and, bizarrely, "THINK OF YOUR FATHER."

"Your dad hired people to protest against you," Jordan muttered as they pushed through. "That's a new level of messed up."

"That's Robert Price for you. Go big on the manipulation or go home."

They made it through security. Inside the courthouse, Jordan stopped. "Dude. Look."

Ethan followed his gaze across the lobby.

Sophia.

Six weeks. Forty-two days. One thousand and eight hours since he'd seen her in person.

She looked tired. Thinner than she'd been in March. The stress of legal proceedings showing in every line of her body. But she was here. Standing with her family. Refusing to back down.

She looked up at the same moment, their eyes meeting across the crowded courthouse lobby.

Everything else fell away. The noise, the people, the fear, the stress—all of it narrowed to that single point of connection. Her dark eyes meeting his. All the words they couldn't say. All the touches they couldn't share. All the fear and love and determination packed into a single look.

*I'm here. I'm not backing down. I love you.*

*I see you. I'm with you. I love you too.*

Then Lisa Huang appeared at Sophia's elbow, speaking quietly, and Sophia's gaze broke away. Lisa was pointing toward a conference room, gesturing for the Chen family to follow her.

Michael Chen appeared at Ethan's elbow. "Come on. We need to prep for your emancipation hearing."

"I saw her." Ethan's voice came out rough.

"I know. After the charges hearing, you'll be able to talk to her properly. Just a little longer."

A little longer. Ethan could do that.

He followed Michael to a different conference room, Jordan trailing behind them. The room was small, sterile, with a table and uncomfortable chairs and windows that looked out over the courthouse steps where protesters were still chanting.

Michael set down his briefcase, pulling out files. "Okay. Criminal charges hearing is first, nine AM. That's Sophia's proceeding, not yours, but you're here as a potential witness. Then at ten AM, we have your emancipation hearing. Judge Morrison is presiding—she's experienced with family law, generally fair, but tough. She's not going to grant emancipation just because you want it. You need to prove you're financially independent, emotionally mature, and that emancipation is in your best interest."

Ethan nodded. They'd been over this a hundred times. "I have the MIT scholarship. Full ride. I have summer job offers. I can support myself."

"That's the financial argument, yes. But there's also the emotional argument. Your father's legal team is going to paint this as teenage rebellion over a girl. They're going to say you're throwing away a hockey career for infatuation. They're going to argue that you're not mature enough to make this decision."

"I'm not throwing away hockey. MIT has a club team. I can still play."

"I know that. You know that. But Robert's narrative is that professional hockey—NHL dreams—was your path, and Sophia convinced you to give it up. We need to counter that narrative with the truth: you're making your own choices about your own future, and Robert has been controlling those choices for seventeen years."

"Which he has been." Ethan's voice was flat. "He decided I'd play professional hockey when I was four years old. I never got a choice in any of it. And when I finally tried to choose differently, he weaponized the law against the girl I love."

"Exactly. That's what you need to convey to Judge Morrison. Not anger—she won't respond well to anger. But clear, calm testimony about a pattern of control and the need for independence."

Jordan, sitting in the corner, spoke up. "What if Robert brings up the fact that Ethan and Sophia started dating when he was still seventeen?"

Michael sighed. "He will absolutely bring that up. That's his entire argument for the criminal charges. But Ethan's testimony will counter it—you two were childhood friends who reconnected. There was no manipulation. You made independent choices about MIT before the relationship even became romantic."

"That's true," Ethan confirmed. "I applied to MIT in December. Sophia and I didn't start officially dating until January. The choices were mine."

"Good. Stick to that timeline. Emphasize your own agency. And remember—the emancipation hearing isn't about whether your relationship with Sophia is appropriate. It's about whether you're mature enough to be legally independent from Robert. Stay focused on that."

They spent the next hour reviewing testimony, going over potential questions, preparing for every angle Robert's lawyers might take. Michael was thorough, methodical, exactly the kind of lawyer Ethan needed for this.

At eight forty-five, there was a knock on the conference room door.

Lisa Huang stuck her head in. "Charges hearing starts in fifteen minutes. Thought you might want to be there."

Michael looked at Ethan. "You don't have to be. It's Sophia's proceeding."

"I'm going," Ethan said immediately. "If they charge her, I need to be there."

"Alright. But sit separately. Perception matters."

They filed into the small courtroom—formal, with wood paneling and harsh fluorescent lights. Sophia was already seated at the defense table with Lisa. Her parents and Maya were behind her.

Ethan took a seat in the back public gallery, Jordan next to him. Across the courtroom, Robert sat at the prosecution side with his lawyers and PR person.

Robert looked smug. Confident. Like a man who thought he'd already won.

Ethan felt rage simmer.

The judge entered—Judge Thompson, stern and gray-haired. Everyone stood, then sat.

"This is the matter of Province of Manitoba versus Sophia Chen," Judge Thompson said. "Ms. Chen faces potential charges under Section 151—sexual contact with a minor. How does the prosecution wish to proceed?"

Robert's lead lawyer stood. Tall, expensive, exactly the kind of lawyer Robert would hire.

"Your Honor, the prosecution requires a statement from Ms. Chen before we proceed."

Judge Thompson looked at Sophia. "Ms. Chen, you've been informed that if you publicly recant your relationship with Ethan Price and agree to no further contact, the prosecution will withdraw these charges. Is that correct?"

Lisa stood. "That is correct, Your Honor. However, Ms. Chen declines to recant. The relationship was legal, consensual, and non-coercive. She will not be pressured into false testimony."

A murmur went through the courtroom.

Judge Thompson looked at the prosecution. "The deadline for Ms. Chen to recant is nine AM. It is currently eight fifty-seven. Does Ms. Chen wish to change her statement?"

Every eye turned to Sophia.

She stood slowly, deliberately. Her voice was steady, clear, unwavering.

"No, Your Honor. I will not recant. Ethan Price and I were childhood friends who reconnected in senior year. Our relationship is based on mutual respect, shared interests, and genuine affection. I did not manipulate him. I did not coerce him. I supported his choices, as he supported mine. I will not lie about that to avoid charges that should never have been filed."

Pride surged through Ethan so strongly he nearly stood and cheered. That was Sophia—brave, brilliant, refusing to back down even when threatened with prison.

Judge Thompson looked at the prosecution. "It's eight fifty-eight. Does the prosecution wish to proceed with charges?"

The lawyer glanced at Robert, whose face showed frustrated rage. Then the lawyer looked back at the judge.

Eight fifty-nine.

The courtroom was silent.

Nine AM.

The prosecution lawyer stood. "Your Honor, after careful consideration—"

Everyone held their breath.

"—the prosecution withdraws all charges against Sophia Chen."

The courtroom erupted.

Sophia's mother burst into tears. Maya screamed "YES!" loud enough to make the judge wince. Thomas Chen wrapped his arms around his wife, relief written across his face.

Lisa Huang smiled, satisfied and unsurprised. "Told you it was a bluff."

Ethan felt his knees go weak. She was safe. They'd dropped the charges. Sophia wasn't going to be prosecuted.

Across the courtroom, Robert's face was a mask of fury and humiliation. He'd been certain Sophia would break. So confident the threat would work.

He'd been wrong.

Judge Thompson banged his gavel. "Order. I want order." He looked at Sophia. "Ms. Chen, the charges against you are dismissed with prejudice. You're free to go."

Sophia sat down hard, like her legs wouldn't hold her. Lisa put a hand on her shoulder. Maya was hugging their parents, all of them crying.

Michael leaned over to Ethan. "That's victory one. Now for yours. Ten minutes."

Ethan nodded, not trusting his voice.

Across the courtroom, Sophia turned and looked directly at him.

And smiled.

That smile—exhausted, relieved, triumphant—made everything worth it. Every argument with Robert. Every day of separation. Every hour of legal proceedings. Worth it for that smile.

---

The courtroom cleared for the brief recess. In the hallway, Lisa caught Ethan's arm. "You have ten minutes before emancipation. You're allowed to talk to her now—charges dropped, restrictions lifted."

Ethan's heart pounded. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. You still have to win emancipation."

But Ethan was already moving, scanning the hallway. Maya saw him first, grinning.

"Ethan!"

Sophia turned.

Six weeks. Forty-two days. One thousand and eight hours.

And then he was walking toward her, and she was walking toward him, meeting in the middle of the courthouse hallway.

"Hi," she said, voice thick with tears.

"Hi."

And then her hands were in his, and his arms were around her, and he was hugging her for the first time in six weeks and it felt like breathing after drowning.

She was crying. He was crying. Neither cared.

"I didn't drop you," she whispered.

"I know. Thank you."

"I wasn't going to. Ever."

He pulled back to see her face, hands still holding hers. "I'm getting emancipated today. Right now. Ten minutes."

"I know. I'm going to testify if they need me."

"You don't have to—"

"Yes, I do. After everything your father tried? I'm testifying about exactly who you are and why you deserve freedom."

God, he loved her.

"I missed you," he said.

"I missed you too. So much."

"Ethan," Michael called. "We need to go."

"Sophia," her dad said at the same time. "Come on."

They separated reluctantly, Sophia watching Ethan disappear. Ten minutes together after six weeks. Not enough.

But in one hour, they'd have forever.

---

At ten AM, Judge Morrison entered, and everyone stood.

"Please be seated," she said, taking her bench. She was in her fifties, African-Canadian, with an air of someone who had seen everything. "We're here for emancipation petition filed by Ethan Price, age 17, seeking emancipation from Robert Price. Let's begin."

Sophia held her breath.

This was it.

Victory number two.

Or complete disaster.

The hearing began.
