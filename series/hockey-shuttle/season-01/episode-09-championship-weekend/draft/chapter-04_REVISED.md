# CHAPTER 4: THE KISS
## 7:00 PM - Midnight

---

Jordan Nakamura's house was already packed by the time they arrived at seven.

Music poured through open windows, bass thumping loud enough to rattle the porch. Cars lined both sides of the street—teammates' trucks, friends' sedans, a few vehicles Sophia didn't recognize. Through the front window, she could see bodies moving, laughing, dancing.

Half the school, Jordan had said. He might have been underselling it.

Ethan hesitated at the door, hand still holding hers. "We can still bail. Get pizza, hide in my apartment, pretend this day didn't happen."

Sophia squeezed his fingers. "You want to celebrate. You said so."

"I know. But now that we're here..." He looked through the window at the crowd. "Everyone's going to want to talk about court. About my dad. About emancipation. I don't know if I can handle that yet."

"Then we don't talk about it." Sophia turned to face him. "We go in, we say hi to Jordan, we get food, we dance badly. If anyone asks about court, we say 'not tonight' and change the subject. And if it gets too much, we leave."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that. You're free now, remember? You don't owe anyone anything."

Ethan pulled her close, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "What did I do to deserve you?"

"Shared your granola bars in junior kindergarten."

He laughed, and some of the tension left his shoulders. "Okay. Let's do this. But if Marcus starts asking about legal fees—"

"We're out of there."

"Deal."

They walked in together, hand in hand.

---

The immediate reaction was exactly what Sophia expected: everyone turning, someone yelling "THEY'RE HERE!", and then the entire room erupting in cheers.

Jordan appeared first, grinning like he'd won the lottery. "THE LEGALLY FREE MAN! AND HIS CRIMINALLY HOT GIRLFRIEND WHO IS NO LONGER FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES!"

"That's the worst introduction ever," Sophia said.

"I workshopped it." Jordan pulled them both into a hug. "Seriously though, congratulations. You guys did it. You actually did it."

More people crowded around—teammates clapping Ethan on the back, Sophia's badminton friends hugging her, everyone talking at once about court and freedom and how amazing it all was. It was overwhelming but in a good way. These were their people. Their friends. Everyone who'd supported them through six weeks of legal hell.

Maya materialized with drinks—soda for both of them, because alcohol after the day they'd had seemed like a terrible idea. "To surviving!" she toasted.

"To freedom!" Jordan added.

Everyone raised their glasses. Sophia and Ethan caught each other's eyes across the circle of friends, both smiling.

They'd done it. They'd actually done it.

---

The next two hours passed in a blur of celebration.

Food appeared—pizza, wings, someone's attempt at homemade nachos that was more cheese than chip. Sophia found herself starving, eating more than she had in weeks while surrounded by friends all talking about summer plans and MIT and how crazy the whole court situation had been.

"I still can't believe Robert just walked out," one of Ethan's teammates said. "Like, his son just won legal freedom and he couldn't even stick around to—"

"We're not talking about that tonight," Sophia interrupted firmly. The guy looked chagrined.

"Right. Sorry, man."

"It's okay." Ethan's hand found Sophia's under the table. "Just... not tonight."

The conversation shifted to safer topics. Someone had brought a Dance Dance Revolution setup—retro and ridiculous—and soon there was a tournament happening. Ethan and Sophia teamed up against Maya and Jordan, both couples failing spectacularly and laughing too hard to care.

"You're terrible at this!" Maya yelled as Sophia missed another step.

"I'm a badminton player, not a dancer!"

"Clearly!"

Ethan was worse than Sophia, all hockey reflexes and zero rhythm. But he was laughing, genuinely laughing, and that was worth any amount of embarrassment.

When their song ended with a dismal score, they collapsed onto the couch together, breathless and grinning.

"We're never doing that again," Ethan said.

"Agreed."

Jordan appeared with his phone. "Okay, I need a photo for posterity. Legally free Ethan and criminally acquitted Sophia on the night of their victory."

They posed, Sophia leaning into Ethan's side, both of them smiling for real this time. Jordan snapped the picture and showed them.

They looked happy. Actually, genuinely happy. For the first time in months.

"That's going in my 'Wholesome Love Conquers Legal Bullshit' album," Jordan declared.

"You have an album for that?" Sophia asked.

"I do now."

---

By nine o'clock, the party had found its rhythm. Music played—a mix of current pop and throwback classics. People danced in the living room, clustered in conversation in the kitchen, spread out on the back patio. It was loud and chaotic and perfect.

Sophia found herself by the snack table, refilling her drink, when Emma appeared.

"You look happy," her badminton teammate said.

"I am happy."

"Good. You deserve it." Emma paused. "Can I ask you something? You don't have to answer if you don't want."

"Sure."

"This morning, when the deadline hit and you didn't drop him... were you scared?"

Sophia thought about standing in that courthouse at 8:59 AM, knowing that not recanting meant possible prosecution. About her lawyer's confidence that it was a bluff. About choosing Ethan anyway, even if it wasn't.

"Terrified," Sophia admitted. "But I couldn't drop him. Even if they'd gone through with charges, even if I'd ended up with a record, I couldn't abandon him. Not after everything."

Emma hugged her. "That's the most romantic and terrifying thing I've ever heard."

"Welcome to my life."

They laughed, and Sophia felt another layer of tension dissolve. She had good friends. She had people who understood. She was going to be okay.

Across the room, she caught Ethan's eye. He was talking to Marcus and some other teammates, but he'd been tracking her location all night. When their gazes met, he smiled—that soft, private smile that was just for her.

She smiled back.

*Later*, she mouthed.

He nodded, understanding. *Later.*

---

The dancing started in earnest around nine-thirty.

Someone turned up the music and suddenly the living room was packed with bodies moving, laughing, singing along to songs everyone knew. Sophia let Maya pull her into the chaos, both of them dancing terribly and not caring.

Ethan appeared beside her, moving with that careful self-consciousness of someone who'd spent more time on ice skates than dance floors. But he was trying, and he was smiling, and when Sophia grabbed his hands to spin him, he went with it.

"You're a terrible dancer!" she yelled over the music.

"I know!"

"I don't care!"

"Good!"

They danced like that for three songs, surrounded by friends, just being teenagers at a party. No courts. No lawyers. No life-altering decisions. Just music and movement and joy.

But Sophia kept noticing Ethan glancing toward the hallway. Toward the stairs that led to Jordan's art studio. Toward the roof access they'd talked about earlier.

During a slower song, he leaned in close. "Want to get some air?"

Her heart jumped. "Yeah. Let's go."

They slipped away from the crowd, nobody really noticing as they ducked into the quieter hallway. Jordan's art studio was at the top of a narrow staircase, the door propped open to let in the cool evening breeze.

As they climbed, Sophia noticed Jordan watching from across the room. He caught her eye, then deliberately looked at the stairs, then back at her. He nodded once—permission granted, privacy respected.

She mouthed "thank you."

He grinned and turned back to the party.

---

The art studio was exactly as Sophia remembered from other parties—paint-splattered floors, canvases stacked against walls, the smell of turpentine and creativity. The skylight was propped open, ladder extended to the roof access.

"You weren't kidding about the roof," Sophia said.

"Jordan mentioned it earlier. Said we'd earned some privacy." Ethan tested the ladder. "You okay climbing?"

"In this dress? Might be interesting."

"I'll go first. Catch you if you fall."

"My hero," she teased, but she meant it.

Ethan climbed quickly, disappearing through the skylight. Then his face appeared, backlit by stars. "Come on. It's beautiful up here."

Sophia hiked up her sundress slightly and climbed. Her legs were shaking—not from exertion but from anticipation. They hadn't been truly alone, truly private, since January. Four and a half months of supervised visits and monitored calls and lawyers watching their every interaction.

Tonight, finally, it was just them.

Ethan helped her through the skylight, his hands warm and sure on her waist. The roof was flat, tar paper and gravel, with a low wall around the edges. The sky was that particular Winnipeg spring color—not quite dark yet at 9:30, but getting there, deep blue bleeding into purple.

Stars were starting to appear.

The city spread out below them, lights flickering on in windows and streetlamps. The party noise was muffled here, just bass and occasional laughter drifting up. Otherwise, quiet.

"Hi," Ethan said softly.

"Hi yourself." Sophia leaned against him, and he wrapped his arm around her shoulders, pulling her close. They stood like that for a moment, just breathing, just being.

Actually alone. No supervision. No rules. No threats hanging over their heads.

Free.

---

"How are you still standing?" Sophia asked. "We've been awake since five."

"Adrenaline. Also I think I'm too tired to sleep." His voice was rough, worn down by the long day. "You?"

"Same. My brain won't shut off." She tilted her head back to look at the stars. More appearing every minute. "We really did it."

"We really did." His arm tightened. "Judge Morrison, emancipation granted, everything."

"The criminal charges dropped."

"My mom leaving my dad."

"Caroline apologizing."

"MIT confirmed." His voice cracked slightly on those words. "Soph. We're *going to MIT together*."

She turned to face him properly, and something in her chest cracked open—all the fear and tension and barely-held-together determination from the past four months. He was looking at her the way he'd been looking at her since January, since before January, since they were nine years old probably.

Like she was the answer to every question he'd ever asked.

"We survived," she whispered.

"Yeah." He reached up, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, his fingers lingering against her cheek. "We did."

"Your parents, the custody fight, criminal charges, all of it."

"Six weeks of no contact before that."

"Four and a half months of wanting this."

His thumb traced her cheekbone. "Every single day of those four and a half months."

The sunset light caught in his eyes—brown and gold and impossibly warm. She'd memorized every fleck, every shade, but somehow they were still surprising her. Still making her heart skip beats.

"What happens now?" she asked. Not scared, just... wondering. They'd been in survival mode so long.

"Now?" He smiled, slow and real. "Now we get to just... be together. No countdown. No checking over our shoulders. Just us."

"Just us," she repeated. Testing the words. They felt too good to be true.

"Tell me about MIT," he said. "What are you most excited about?"

She let herself lean into the question, into the future they'd finally earned. "The labs. Professor Yang's quantum computing research. The fact that we can get coffee at 2 AM when we're cramming for exams." She paused. "Walking across campus holding your hand."

His smile widened. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." She reached for his hand, laced their fingers together. "Public hand-holding. Revolutionary concept."

"We could do more than hold hands, you know." His voice dropped lower. "We're not breaking any rules anymore."

Her pulse jumped. "Radical idea."

"Pretty sure Jordan gave us this roof for a reason." He was closer now, or maybe she was, gravity pulling them together like they'd been orbiting for years and finally hit critical proximity.

"Smart friend."

"Remember our entropy project?" Sophia said, the memory surfacing suddenly. "Back in March, at the science fair?"

Ethan laughed softly. "How could I forget? You were yelling about thermodynamic equilibrium at 2 AM."

"And you were explaining hockey momentum equations to make the point clearer." She looked up at him. "That's why we won gold. Because we're partners. Equals. We push each other to think differently."

"That's what we are," he agreed. "Partners."

"In everything."

"In everything." His free hand came up to cup her face. "Sophia."

"Yeah?"

"I love you." The words were simple, but his voice carried everything—months of history, weeks of hell, every scared moment and brave choice and desperate hope. "I have loved you since I was nine years old. I loved you when we were apart. I loved you every day we couldn't be together. I loved you through everything, and I'm going to love you for everything that comes next."

Her eyes were burning. "Ethan."

"I'm not finished." His thumb brushed across her cheek, catching a tear she hadn't realized had fallen. "You are the bravest, smartest, most stubborn person I've ever met. You stood up to my parents. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. You didn't drop the charges even when facing jail. You're my best friend and you always have been and I—" His voice cracked. "I never stopped loving you. Not for one single day."

She couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Every analytical bone in her body had dissolved.

"I love you," she managed. "I love you so much it doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to fall in love gradually, logically, but I think I loved you before I knew what the word meant. Every science competition, every hockey practice, every time you smiled at me like I was the only person in the world who mattered—"

"You were. You are."

"I've been in love with you my entire life." The words were tumbling out now, unstoppable. "When you left, I thought I'd lost my chance. When we found each other again, I thought it was impossible. When your parents tried to take you away, I thought I'd break. But here we are. We're here, and we're free, and I love you. I love you."

"Sophia." His forehead touched hers. They were breathing the same air. "Can I kiss you?"

"Please."

---

The first touch of his lips was gentle—questioning, careful, like she might disappear if he pressed too hard. Like they'd wake up and discover this was another dream, another impossible hope that reality would crush.

But Sophia pressed closer, her hands sliding up to his shoulders, answering the question without words: *I'm real. We're real. This is finally, actually happening.*

He made a soft sound—relief and wonder and something that sounded like her name—and deepened the kiss. His hand slid into her hair, fingers tangling in the strands, and oh. *Oh.*

This was different than the New Year's kiss. That had been stolen, desperate, public—seventeen seconds of rebellion before Jordan pulled them apart, before reality crashed back in. That kiss had tasted like champagne and countdown pressure and the terrified knowledge that they'd just broken every rule.

This kiss tasted like freedom.

Sophia wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer, needing to eliminate every molecule of space between them. Four and a half months. One hundred thirty-five days of supervised visits and monitored calls and lawyers watching their every interaction. Six weeks before that of complete separation, of not even being allowed to hear his voice.

All of it—all the fear and fighting and forced distance—dissolved in the warmth of his mouth on hers.

He kissed her like she was oxygen after drowning. Like she was the first sunrise after endless night. His arm banded around her waist, holding her like she was precious and necessary and *his*, finally his, no one could take this away anymore.

Her heart was racing everywhere—in her throat, her wrists, that pulse point behind her ear that he'd kissed once in January and she'd thought about every day since. Every beat saying *yes yes yes finally yes*.

They broke apart for air, both breathing hard, and Ethan laughed—pure joy, unfiltered and bright. The sound lit her up from the inside.

"God," he breathed. "Sophia—"

"Don't stop." She pulled him back down. "Please don't stop."

"Never," he promised against her lips. "Never letting you go."

The second wave of kissing was different—less desperate, more exploratory. Learning each other. She traced the angle of his jaw with her palm, feeling the slight stubble there, the warmth of his skin. He kissed the corner of her mouth, then her cheek, then back to her lips, each touch deliberate and reverent.

When his lips met hers again, slower this time, Sophia's knees went liquid. She tightened her grip on his shoulders, needing the support, needing the anchor. He tasted like the Coke he'd been drinking earlier—sweet and sharp—and underneath that, just *him*. Some combination of mint toothpaste and that cologne he wore and something indefinable that was purely Ethan.

His hand traced patterns on her back through the thin fabric of her sundress—slow circles, gentle pressure—and shivers cascaded down her spine. Every nerve ending was firing. She'd never understood people who described kissing as "electric" before, thought it was hyperbole, but no. *No.* This was exactly that. Lightning in her veins, sparks everywhere he touched.

"Soph," he murmured, pulling back just enough to look at her. His eyes were dark, pupils blown wide, and something in her stomach flipped at the way he was looking at her. Like she'd hung the stars appearing above them. "I'm—I'm trying to memorize this. So I never forget the moment everything became possible."

Her breath caught. "Ethan."

"You're so beautiful." His thumb traced her lower lip, gentle and wondering. "I've thought that since we were kids but right now—here—you're—"

She kissed him again before he could finish, because if he kept talking like that she was going to cry, and she didn't want to cry. She wanted to feel *this*—the solid reality of him against her, the taste of him, the way his breath hitched when she kissed that spot just below his ear.

Time stopped meaning anything. Could have been minutes or hours. The sky darkened around them—deep purple bleeding to black, stars emerging in earnest now—and neither of them noticed. The city lights below spread out like scattered diamonds, but Sophia's entire world had narrowed to this: the roof, Ethan's arms, the infinite variations of kissing.

Sometimes slow and deep, all-consuming. Sometimes quick and light, breaking apart to laugh at nothing, at everything, at the sheer impossibility of being *here* after everything they'd survived. Sometimes just foreheads pressed together, breathing, existing in the same space with no barriers.

His fingers found the pulse point on her wrist, pressing gently, feeling her heartbeat hammering. "You're shaking."

"So are you," she pointed out, feeling the tremor in his hands.

"I know. I can't—" He kissed her again, cutting off his own words. When he pulled back, his voice was rough: "Four months. God, Sophia, four months of wanting to do this and not being allowed to touch you. Do you know how many times I—"

"Tell me." She needed to hear it. Needed to know she hadn't been alone in the wanting.

"Every supervised visit. Every phone call your lawyer monitored. Every night I lay in that apartment thinking about you." His forehead touched hers. "I'd close my eyes and remember New Year's Eve. Seventeen seconds. I had it timed. And I'd think—when this is over, when we're free, I'm going to kiss her for hours. Days. I'm going to make up for every second we lost."

"Hours and days," she echoed, smiling against his lips. "That's ambitious."

"I'm very motivated."

She laughed, and felt him smile, and then they were kissing again but it was different—playful, joyful, punctuated with laughter and whispered words that didn't quite make sense. Nonsense endearments and promises and his name, her name, over and over like incantations.

At some point she lost track of where she ended and he began. Her fingers tangled in his hair—softer than it looked, falling across his forehead the way it always did. His hands settled at her waist, thumbs tracing small circles on her hipbones through the dress, and the touch was somehow both innocent and devastating.

"I love you," she said again, between kisses. Couldn't stop saying it. Four and a half months of holding back, and now the words kept spilling out. "I love you, I love you, I love—"

"I love you." Kiss. "I love you." Another kiss, deeper. "So much, Sophia. So much it—I don't have words—"

"Then don't use words." She pulled him closer, eliminating the last breath of space between them. "Just—this. Just us."

"Just us," he agreed, and kissed her again.

The Winnipeg sky finished its transition to full dark above them. The stars were out in force now—hundreds of them, maybe thousands, that particular northern brilliance that happened on clear spring nights. The city hummed below, distant and separate. The party continued in the house beneath them, bass thumping, laughter drifting up, but it felt like another world entirely.

This roof belonged to them. This moment belonged to them. Finally, after everything, they were allowed to have this.

Sophia felt it settling into her bones—the rightness of it. The perfection. Not perfect in an unrealistic way, but perfect in the way that mattered: this person, this moment, this hard-won freedom to choose each other.

"Hey," Ethan said softly, pulling back to look at her properly. His hands came up to cup her face, gentle and sure. "You okay?"

She realized she was crying—happy tears streaming down her face without her permission. "I'm so okay. I'm so—we're here. We did it. We're actually here and no one can—" Her voice cracked. "No one can take this away anymore."

"No one," he confirmed, brushing away her tears with his thumbs. "Not my father, not the courts, not anyone. We're free, Sophia. We're free and we're together and—" His voice broke. "I'm never letting you go."

"Good." She caught his hands, pressed them against her face, needing the warmth and pressure and reality of his touch. "Because you're stuck with me now. You know that, right? MIT, engineering school, wherever we end up after—you're stuck."

"Best fate I can imagine." His smile was bright enough to rival the stars. "You and me. Whatever comes next."

"Everything that comes next," she corrected.

"Everything," he agreed.

He kissed her again, softer now. Gentler. Not desperate or urgent but sweet—a promise, a beginning, a celebration of having time. They had the whole summer. They had MIT in August. They had years stretching out ahead of them, no more countdowns or deadlines or separation orders.

They had each other, finally, completely, freely.

Sophia could feel him smiling against her lips and started smiling too. The kiss dissolved into laughter—breathless, joyful, slightly unhinged from exhaustion and relief and too many emotions to process.

"We're really doing this," she said.

"We really are." He rested his forehead against hers, still smiling. "No more hiding. No more rules. No more—"

His phone buzzed.

They both froze.

"Ignore it," Sophia said. "Whatever it is—"

It buzzed again. And again. Someone calling, not texting.

Ethan closed his eyes. "I should—what if it's my mom? What if something happened with—"

"Check." She stepped back reluctantly, already missing his warmth. "It's okay. Check."

He pulled out his phone, and his expression shifted—confusion, then shock. "It's a Detroit area code."

"Detroit?" Her stomach dropped. "Ethan—"

"I don't know anyone in—" Realization hit his face. "The Red Wings. They recruited me back in April, before I chose MIT. But that was—I told them no, I'm not—" The phone kept ringing. "Should I answer?"

"I think you have to."

His hand was shaking as he accepted the call. "Hello? This is Ethan."

Sophia watched his face as he listened. Watched the color drain from his cheeks. Watched his eyes go wide with something that looked like shock or terror or maybe both.

"I understand," he said finally. "Yes. Thank you for calling."

He hung up and stood there, staring at his phone like it had just transformed into a bomb.

"Ethan?" Sophia approached carefully. "What did they want?"

He looked up, and his expression was—she couldn't read it. Shocked? Confused? Scared?

"That was a scout," he said slowly. "From the Detroit Red Wings. They—back in April, when they were recruiting me, I said no because of MIT. Because of you. Because of choosing education over—" He shook his head like trying to clear it. "They said they've been following my season. That my emancipation status makes me eligible for earlier entry to the NHL. They want to meet next week. To talk about a contract."

The words hit like a physical blow.

"A contract?" Sophia's voice sounded distant to her own ears. "Like, a professional contract?"

"Yeah." He laughed, but it sounded wrong—hollow and shocked. "An NHL contract. The thing I've been training for my whole life. The thing I gave up for MIT. For us."

"But you chose MIT."

"I know. I did. I—" He ran his hand through his hair, messing up the strands she'd just had her fingers in. "They said it's not an either-or anymore. That they have a program for academically gifted players. Modified enrollment. I could play hockey October through April and attend MIT May through August. Five years instead of four, but I'd get both."

The world tilted.

Both.

He could have both.

Everything they'd fought for—MIT together, choosing education over hockey, freedom from his father's dreams—and there was a third option all along?

"Did you know this existed?" Sophia asked carefully.

"No. God, no. If I'd known..." He trailed off, looking sick. "We fought so hard. You faced criminal charges. I sued my own father. And maybe—maybe we didn't have to choose at all."

They stared at each other. The party continued below them, music and laughter and celebration, but it felt very far away.

All the warmth from kissing had evaporated. Sophia's skin felt cold despite the mild spring air.

"What are you going to do?" she whispered.

"I don't know." His voice cracked. "This morning I was sure. MIT, engineering, building something real instead of chasing Dad's dream. But Soph—what if it wasn't just Dad's dream? What if part of me still wants this? What if I—" He stopped. "What about us? What about MIT together? What about everything we just—"

His phone buzzed again—email notification. He glanced at it, and his face went even paler.

"What is it?"

"Email. From the Red Wings. Contract details." He scrolled, reading, and Sophia watched him process the numbers. "Signing bonus of two and a half million dollars. Base salary of three point two million per year. Three years guaranteed."

Two and a half million dollars.

More money than Sophia's family would see in decades. Her parents were comfortable—her mom's teaching salary, her dad's consulting work—but they weren't *rich*. They'd saved carefully for years to afford MIT's tuition. They'd budgeted and planned and stressed.

Two and a half million dollars was generational wealth. Never-worry-about-money-again wealth. Buy-your-parents-a-house wealth.

And Ethan might give that up for her?

Or worse—what if he took it? What if he realized that his whole life had been pointing toward this moment, and choosing her meant choosing poverty by comparison?

"When do they need an answer?" she asked. Her voice didn't sound like her own.

"June first. Two weeks."

Two weeks to decide between the life they'd planned and the dream he'd thought he'd given up.

Two weeks to figure out if choosing each other meant being apart half the year—him in Detroit October through April, her at MIT alone, their relationship reduced to phone calls and occasional visits.

Two weeks to determine if this perfect day, this perfect kiss, was the beginning of everything or the end.

Sophia looked at Ethan—at the boy she'd loved since they were nine, at the young man who'd fought for freedom, at her best friend and partner and the person she wanted to build a life with.

And she saw the uncertainty in his eyes.

For months, their path had been clear. Difficult, yes. Painful, absolutely. But clear. MIT or NHL. Education or money. Each other or his parents' dreams.

Now the path forked into territories they'd never mapped. Detroit winters and Cambridge summers. Professional athlete and MIT student. Everything they'd wanted, but divided, separated, split between two impossible lives.

"We should go back down," Ethan said quietly. "I need to—I need to think. Process."

"Okay."

But neither of them moved. They stood there on the roof, the site of the most perfect kiss either of them had ever experienced, and felt it all slipping away.

Finally, Ethan reached for her hand. "I love you. That hasn't changed."

"I love you too."

"I don't know what I'm going to do. But I—we'll figure it out. Together."

"Together," she echoed, trying to believe it.

They climbed back down the ladder in silence. The art studio felt surreal now—paint and possibility, creative chaos, Jordan's generous gift of privacy that had just witnessed both the best and worst moments of the night.

---

They walked back to the party together, hand in hand, and everything was different.

Maya saw them first. She took one look at their faces—Sophia's carefully blank expression, Ethan's shell-shocked confusion—and her smile faltered.

"What happened?" she asked, pulling Sophia aside while Ethan got intercepted by Jordan.

"Nothing. Everything." Sophia couldn't find the words. "I'll tell you later."

"Soph—"

"Later. I promise."

But Maya must have sensed something, because she stuck close for the rest of the night. Emma too. Her friends forming a protective barrier while Sophia smiled and nodded and pretended everything was fine.

Across the room, Jordan was doing the same thing for Ethan—keeping teammates from asking too many questions, maintaining the celebration energy while clearly concerned.

Around eleven, Sophia found herself on the back patio, needing air that didn't smell like the roof. Maya sat beside her.

"You don't have to tell me what happened," Maya said. "But you look like someone who just had the best and worst night of her life simultaneously."

"That's—yeah. That's accurate."

Maya waited. Sophia struggled with how much to say, how much she could say before breaking down entirely.

"We kissed," she finally managed. "On the roof. It was perfect. Like, perfect perfect. Everything I'd been waiting for since January."

"That's good, right?"

"It was. Until his phone rang." Sophia stared at the patio lights strung overhead. "NHL scout. Detroit Red Wings. They want to sign him. Two and a half million dollars. Modified program where he could do both hockey and MIT but we'd be apart most of the year."

Maya sucked in a breath. "Oh, Soph."

"We fought so hard. I faced criminal charges. He sued his father. And maybe—maybe there was another way all along. Maybe we suffered for nothing."

"You didn't suffer for nothing. You fought for freedom. For the right to choose." Maya took her hand. "And now Ethan has to choose. For real. Not because Robert's forcing him, not because the courts say he has to, but because he gets to decide what he actually wants."

"What if he chooses hockey?"

"Then you deal with that. Together." Maya squeezed her fingers. "But Sophia—you can't make this choice for him. And you can't resent him for whatever he decides. This has to be his decision."

"I know." She did know. But knowing didn't make it hurt less. "I just—we finally got here. We finally got to be together. And now—"

"Now you deal with the next thing. That's what you do. You face impossible situations and you survive them." Maya's voice was fierce. "You'll survive this too."

Sophia wanted to believe her. She really did.

---

They left around eleven-thirty, making excuses about exhaustion. Jordan hugged them both at the door.

"Text me tomorrow?" he said to Ethan.

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

"Both of you," Jordan added, looking at Sophia. "Whatever's going on—you've got people. Remember that."

In the car, they sat in silence. Ethan's hands on the steering wheel, knuckles white. Sophia staring out the window at the dark streets passing by.

"I'm sorry," Ethan finally said. "After tonight, after the roof, after everything—"

"Don't apologize. This is huge. You need to consider it."

"But what about us?"

"We'll figure it out." She tried to sound confident, tried to channel Maya's certainty. "We always do."

He drove carefully, probably too exhausted to be driving at all. When he pulled up to her driveway, they sat for a moment, neither moving.

"That kiss," Ethan said quietly. "On the roof. That was—"

"I know."

"I meant everything I said. About loving you. About never letting go."

"I know," she repeated. "I meant it too."

He leaned across the console, kissing her softly. It tasted different than the roof kisses—this one tasted like uncertainty and goodbye, even though goodbye wasn't the right word. It was more like: *I love you but I don't know what happens next.*

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too."

She got out of the car and walked to her door. When she turned back, he was still sitting there, phone in his hand, staring at the email that had just complicated everything.

Inside, Sophia leaned against the closed door, trying to process.

This morning: criminal charges and emancipation hearing.

This afternoon: freedom and paperwork.

This evening: the perfect kiss under the stars.

And now: an NHL contract offer that changed everything.

Her phone buzzed. Ethan.

*I love you. That hasn't changed. Sleep well.*

She stared at the message, then typed back.

*I love you too. We'll figure it out.*

Hit send.

But as she climbed the stairs to her room, as she changed out of her blue sundress and washed off her makeup, she couldn't stop thinking about the numbers. Two and a half million dollars. More money than she could really comprehend.

How could she ask him to give that up for her?

But also—how could she survive five years of modified schedules, of being apart October through April, of building separate lives that only intersected for a few months each year?

She lay in bed staring at the ceiling, processing.

They'd fought so hard. Survived so much. Won their freedom together.

But what if freedom meant he was free to choose a life that didn't include her? Or included her, but only in the margins, in the gaps between seasons and travel schedules?

What if today's perfect kiss was the beginning of the end?

Across the city, Ethan lay in his apartment—the space he'd furnished so carefully, the first place that was truly his—and stared at his phone.

The email was still open. Contract details in black and white. Numbers that would change his life forever.

*Two and a half million dollars.*

His father's voice echoed in his head: *This is what you were meant for. This is your destiny.*

But whose destiny? Robert's dream or his own?

He'd been so sure this morning. MIT, engineering, building something with his mind instead of just his body. Choosing education. Choosing Sophia. Choosing a different path.

But what if he didn't have to choose? What if he could have both?

Except—five years of split schedules. Sophia alone at MIT October through April while he traveled with the team. Missing her birthdays, her big moments, her daily life. Reduced to phone calls and occasional visits and always, always missing each other.

Was that really "having both"? Or was it a compromise that would slowly destroy what they'd built?

He thought about the roof. About her lips on his, her hands in his hair, the way she'd said *I love you* like a prayer. About the perfection of finally being together without fear, without countdown timers, without supervision.

About how right it had felt.

Then he looked at the numbers again.

*Three point two million per year. Three years guaranteed.*

Money to support his mother as she rebuilt her life. Money to never worry again. Money to prove he was worth something beyond his father's control.

But at what cost?

He didn't know. God, he didn't know.

Ethan closed the email and opened his messages instead. Sophia's last text glowed on his screen: *I love you too. We'll figure it out.*

*We'll figure it out.*

They always had before. Through his father's control, through the custody battle, through criminal charges and emancipation hearings and six weeks of forced separation.

But this was different. This wasn't them against an external threat. This was him having to choose between two futures, and no matter what he chose, something would be lost.

He set his phone down and stared at the ceiling.

Free to choose. It had sounded like victory this morning.

Tonight, it felt like torture.

---

In separate beds across the city, neither of them slept.

Sophia lay there thinking about the kiss, about two and a half million dollars, about five years of split schedules and the weight of asking someone to give up their dream.

Ethan lay there thinking about the kiss, about MIT together, about the NHL and whether it was his father's dream or his own.

Both of them processing. Both of them terrified.

The clock ticked past midnight into May 16th.

Two weeks until Ethan had to decide.

Fourteen days to figure out if love was enough.

If choosing each other meant giving up everything else.

Or if there was a way—some impossible, miraculous way—to have it all without losing what mattered most.

They didn't have answers yet.

They just had questions, and fear, and the memory of a perfect kiss that had lasted exactly as long as it took for reality to come crashing back in.
