# CHAPTER 3: FREE
## 11:30 AM - 6:00 PM

---

The courthouse steps were chaos.

Sophia stood blinking in the late-morning sunlight, still processing the judge's words. *Emancipation granted. Effective immediately.* Behind her, the heavy doors had barely closed before the media swarmedcameras, microphones, reporters shouting questions over each other.

"Ethan! How does it feel to be free?"

"Sophia! Do you regret testifying?"

"Is this the end of your relationship with your parents?"

"What's next for you two?"

Ethan froze beside her, his hand still gripping hers from when they'd left the courtroom. She felt his fingers tighten, saw his face go blankthat shutdown expression he got when he was overwhelmed. After three hours of testimony, of laying his life bare in front of strangers, of watching his father walk out without a word, he had nothing left for a press conference.

"Inside," Maya said sharply, materializing at Sophia's other side. "Courthouse bathroom. Now."

Jordan appeared next to Ethan. "I've got him. Follow me."

They moved as a unit, pushing back through the courthouse doors while Michael Chen stepped forward to handle the media. Sophia caught a glimpse of him raising his hands, heard him say something about prepared statements later, and then they were back in the cool, quiet interior.

Maya steered them down a side hallway, away from the main corridors. "Women's restroom, second floor. No cameras allowed in there. Go."

Sophia looked at Ethan. He was pale, breathing too fast, still holding her hand like a lifeline.

"Men's room is right across the hall," Jordan said gently. "You good, man?"

Ethan shook his head. "No. But I will be."

"Take five minutes," Maya said. "Breathe. Process. Then we'll figure out next steps."

Sophia squeezed Ethan's hand. "Meet you out here in five?"

He nodded, then surprised her by pulling her close, pressing his forehead against hers for just a moment. His eyes were closed. "We did it," he whispered.

"We did it," she confirmed.

Then Maya was pulling her toward the women's room and Jordan was guiding Ethan across the hall, and they were separated again. But this time it was temporary. This time, no court order said they couldn't be together.

This time, Ethan was free.

---

The bathroom was blessedly empty.

Sophia leaned against the sink, legs shaking. Maya locked the main door, then turned to her with an expression somewhere between triumph and fury.

"Your ex-boyfriend's father," Maya said slowly, "is a piece of work."

"He walked out."

"I saw. Before the judge even finished. Didn't look back once."

Sophia's chest ached. She'd watched it happenthe moment Judge Morrison said "emancipation granted," Robert Price had stood, grabbed his coat, and left. Just walked out of his son's life. Caroline had stayed, crying quietly in her seat, but Robert was done.

"Ethan must be devastated."

"Ethan's free." Maya's voice was firm. "And yeah, it hurts like hell, but he's FREE. Legally an adult at seventeen. No more control, no more manipulation, no more choosing between hockey and happiness." She stepped forward, pulling Sophia into a hug. "And you, my brilliant sister, have no criminal record. You're going to MIT clean. You won everything."

The tears came then, sudden and overwhelming. Sophia sobbed into Maya's shoulder while her sister held her, murmuring reassurances. All the fear from the past six weeks, all the terror from this morning, all the weight of watching Ethan testify about years of controlled isolationit poured out in ugly, gasping sobs.

"I was so scared," Sophia managed.

"I know."

"What if the charges hadn't been dropped? What if the judge said no?"

"But she didn't. You won, Soph. You both won."

"His dad hates me."

"His dad hates everyone who isn't him. That's not about you."

Sophia pulled back, wiping her face. "Is it terrible that I want to kiss Ethan right now? We just got out of court, his family's imploding, everything's a mess, and all I can think about is how we haven't kissed since New Year's Eve and I really, really want to kiss him."

Maya laughed. "That's the least terrible thing I've heard all day. When this is over, when you're both ready, kiss him senseless. You've earned it."

"Four and a half months since we kissed."

"That's criminal. More criminal than anything Robert tried to charge you with."

Sophia laughed wetly. "You're ridiculous."

"I'm supportive." Maya handed her tissues. "Now fix your face. You look like you've been crying."

"I have been crying."

"Well, stop. We have a victory to celebrate."

---

When they emerged from the bathroom, Ethan and Jordan were waiting in the hallway. Ethan looked marginally betterless pale, breathing normal, though his eyes were red.

He saw Sophia and immediately crossed to her. No hesitation. Just walked right up and pulled her into his arms, holding her tight.

"Hi," she said against his chest.

"Hi." His voice was rough. "Sorry I lost it out there."

"You didn't lose anything. You stood in front of a judge and fought for yourself. That's not losing."

"My dad walked out."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"I'm not." He said it firmly, but she felt the tremor in his hands. "I mean, I am. But I'm not. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense."

They stood there, holding each other in the courthouse hallway while people passed by. A few looked at them curiouslythey'd been all over the local news for weeksbut no one bothered them. It was just two teenagers hugging, both crying a little, both exhausted.

Finally, Jordan cleared his throat. "Uh, guys? Your parents are planning a celebration lunch. Both families. They're asking if you're up for it."

Ethan and Sophia pulled apart enough to look at each other.

"Both families?" Sophia asked carefully.

"Your parents, Maya, me, and Caroline," Jordan clarified. "Robert... left. Like, left-left. Drove away."

Ethan closed his eyes briefly. "Of course he did."

"Caroline wants to talk to you," Jordan continued gently. "She's waiting downstairs. She says it's okay if you're not ready, but she'd like to try to explain."

"Explain what? That she stood by while Dad tried to destroy my girlfriend? That she let him file criminal charges?"

"Ethan," Sophia said softly.

He shook his head. "Sorry. I know she's... she tried to stop him at the end. I know that. It's just"

"A lot," Sophia finished. "It's a lot."

"Yeah."

Maya stepped forward. "How about this: we go get lunch. Neutral territory, somewhere with good food and private seating. Both families can celebrate the win. If Caroline wants to apologize, she can do it there. If it gets weird, we bail."

"What restaurant is going to give us private seating on a Saturday afternoon with no notice?" Ethan asked.

Jordan grinned. "Leave that to me. My parents own Giovanni's. I already calledprivate room is ready whenever we are."

Sophia looked at Ethan. "What do you think? Can you handle lunch right now?"

"I don't know. Can you?"

"I'm starving, actually. First time I've been hungry in weeks."

"Me too." Ethan managed a small smile. "Okay. Let's do it. But if it gets awkward"

"We bail," everyone said in unison.

That got a real laugh from Ethan, and Sophia felt some of the tension ease from her shoulders. They were okay. Bruised and exhausted and emotionally wrung out, but okay.

And they had each other.

Finally. Legally. Completely.

---

Giovanni's was a small Italian restaurant tucked into a corner of Winnipeg's downtown, the kind of place with checkered tablecloths and photos of Italian grandmothers on the walls. Jordan's family had owned it for three generations, and the private room in back was usually reserved for large parties.

Today, it held two families trying to celebrate a victory that felt more complicated than joyful.

Sophia sat between Ethan and Maya, acutely aware of the weird dynamics at the table. Her parents on one sideMom still looked like she wanted to hug everyone and Dad kept checking his phone nervously. Jordan at the head, playing host. And across from them, Caroline Price.

Ethan's mother looked smaller than Sophia remembered. Older. She'd worn a navy suit to court, but she'd taken off the jacket and her blouse was wrinkled. Her eyes were red from crying. She kept looking at Ethan like she was afraid he'd disappear.

The waiter brought water and menus. Everyone ordered automaticallypasta, salads, whatever. Sophia barely registered what she chose. The silence was heavy.

Finally, Caroline spoke.

"Ethan, I" Her voice cracked. She tried again. "I'm so sorry."

Ethan didn't look up from his water glass. "For which part?"

"All of it." Caroline's hands were shaking. "The restraining order. The charges against Sophia. Standing by while your father tried to control every aspect of your life. Not fighting harder when I should have."

"You attacked Sophia. In her own driveway."

"I know. I" Caroline pressed her hands to her face. "I was so angry. Not at her, really. At myself. At Robert. At the situation. And I took it out on the easiest target. That was unforgivable."

Sophia felt Ethan tense beside her. She reached under the table, found his hand, squeezed gently.

"Why did you stay with Dad for so long?" Ethan asked quietly. "You knew what he was doing. You saw it."

"I thought I was protecting you." Caroline lowered her hands. Her eyes were streaming. "That's not an excuse, it's just... the truth. I thought if I could just moderate him, soften the worst of it, keep things from escalating... but I was wrong. I was protecting him, not you. And by the time I realized that, so much damage was done."

The waiter appeared with breadsticks. Everyone ignored them.

"I left him," Caroline said. "Last night. I packed a bag and left. I'm staying with my sister until I figure out what's next."

Ethan's head snapped up. "You left Dad?"

"I chose you." Caroline's voice was firm despite the tears. "I should have chosen you months ago, years ago, but I'm choosing you now. I know that doesn't fix anything. I know I can't undo the hurt. But I'm done letting Robert dictate my choices."

Silence around the table.

Sophia's mother cleared her throat. "Caroline, I think I speak for all of us when I say... that took courage."

"It took too long."

"But you did it." Mom's voice was gentle. "That matters."

Caroline looked at Sophia directly for the first time. "I owe you an apology too. A real one. I hurt you because I was angry at myself. I tried to manipulate you with criminal charges. I let Robert use me as a weapon against your relationship. And you" Her voice broke again. "You stood by my son anyway. You didn't drop him even when facing jail. You're eighteen and braver than I've ever been."

Sophia didn't know what to say. The anger was still therethis woman had attacked her, had filed charges, had stood by while Robert tried to destroy everything. But looking at Caroline now, seeing the genuine devastation in her face, Sophia felt something shift.

"I understand," Sophia said slowly. "I don't... I can't say it's okay, because it's not. What you did hurt. But I understand being caught between loving someone and watching them make terrible choices."

Caroline nodded, wiping her eyes. "Thank you. That's more grace than I deserve."

"Probably," Maya muttered. Sophia elbowed her.

Ethan was staring at his mother. "Are you really leaving Dad?"

"Yes. I called a lawyer this morning. I'm filing for divorce."

"Because of me?"

"Because of me." Caroline reached across the table like she wanted to take Ethan's hand, then stopped, uncertain. "Because I forgot who I was before I married your father. Because I let him turn me into someone who would hurt a teenager to maintain control. Because my son had to sue for emancipation just to have basic autonomy. That's not... that's not who I want to be."

Ethan stared at her for a long moment. Then, slowly, he reached out and took her hand.

Caroline sobbed.

"I'm still so angry at you," Ethan said. His voice was shaking. "I'm angry about the charges, about the attack, about every time you chose Dad over me. That's going to take time to get past."

"I know."

"But I don't want to lose you completely." Tears were streaming down his face now too. "You're my mom. I want... I want to be able to have coffee sometimes. To tell you about MIT. To introduce you to people who matter to me. I want a relationship where you see me, not Dad's hockey dreams."

"I want that too." Caroline was squeezing his hand like a lifeline. "I want to know who you really are. Not who we tried to make you. Just... you."

"I'm going to MIT in August."

"I know. I'm proud of you."

"I'm studying engineering, not playing professional hockey."

"I know. I'm still proud."

"I'm in love with Sophia."

Caroline looked at Sophia, then back at Ethan. "I know. She's brilliant and brave and clearly adores you. You picked well."

Ethan laughed wetly. "Yeah. I did."

Sophia was crying again. So was Maya. Sophia's parents were suspiciously shiny-eyed. Jordan was grinning like this was the best thing he'd ever witnessed.

The waiter returned with food. The mood shifted, lightened. Caroline asked Ethan about MIT's housing, and he explained the dorm situation. Sophia's mom asked about the engineering program. Jordan told an elaborate story about the emancipation hearing that had everyone laughing despite themselves.

By the time dessert arrivedtiramisu that Jordan insisted was on the housethe table felt almost normal. Almost like two families sharing a meal instead of survivors of a legal battlefield.

Sophia excused herself to the bathroom. She needed a minute to process. In the hallway, she ran into Caroline coming from the same direction.

They stopped, awkward.

"Sophia," Caroline said. "Can I... can we talk? Just for a minute?"

Sophia nodded.

Caroline took a shaky breath. "I'm sorry. I've said it, but I want to say it again, just to you. What I did was unforgivable. I attacked you physically. I supported charges that could have destroyed your future. I tried to intimidate you into abandoning my son. That was abuse. That was me using my age and position to hurt you. And I'm so, so sorry."

Sophia studied her. "Why did you do it? Really?"

"Because I was terrified." Caroline's voice was raw. "Terrified of losing Ethan. Terrified of admitting Robert was wrong. Terrified of facing what our marriage had become. You were easier to blame than my husband. Easier to hate than myself."

"That's not fair."

"No, it's not. Nothing about this has been fair." Caroline wiped her eyes. "You want to know something terrible? Part of me is relieved the judge granted emancipation. Because now Ethan's free, and I don't have to keep choosing between my husband and my son. The choice is made. I can finally admit Robert was wrong without it meaning I failed as a mother."

"You didn't fail."

"I did. But maybe... maybe I can do better going forward." Caroline managed a small smile. "Thank you for being there for him. Thank you for not giving up. Thank you for being brave when I wasn't."

Sophia didn't know what to say. The anger was still there, would probably be there for a while. But underneath it was something else. Understanding, maybe. Or at least the beginning of it.

"I love him," Sophia said finally. "I'm going to keep loving him. And I'm going to MIT with him, and we're going to build a life together. I need you to be okay with that."

"I am. Truly." Caroline's smile was stronger now. "I want my son to be happy. And you make him happy. That's enough."

They stood there for another moment, then Caroline pulled Sophia into a careful hug. Sophia let her, even hugged back tentatively. It wasn't forgiveness, not yet. But it was a start.

When they returned to the table, Ethan looked between them with obvious relief. Sophia slid back into her seat next to him and he immediately took her hand.

"Okay?" he murmured.

"Yeah. Okay."

---

By two o'clock, lunch was winding down. Sophia's parents were discussing logistics with Mayasomething about picking up Sophia's things from a friend's house where she'd been staying during the legal proceedings. Caroline was on her phone, presumably dealing with divorce lawyers. Jordan was settling the bill despite protests.

Ethan tugged Sophia's hand. "Can we go outside? Just for a minute?"

They slipped out the restaurant's back entrance into a small alley that served as a delivery area. It was private, quiet, just them and some dumpsters and afternoon sun slanting between buildings.

Ethan leaned against the brick wall, pulling Sophia close. She went easily, wrapping her arms around his waist.

"Today has been the longest day of my entire life," he said.

"It's only two PM."

"That's what I'm saying." He laughed, the sound tired but genuine. "This morning I woke up terrified you'd have a criminal record. Now you're free, I'm legally emancipated, my mom left my dad and apologized to you, and we just had the world's most awkward celebration lunch."

"Don't forget the media circus on the courthouse steps."

"Oh god, I'm trying to forget that." He pulled her closer. "Thank you. For everything. For not dropping me when you could have. For testifying. For giving my mom a chance even after everything."

"She loves you. She just... got lost for a while."

"Yeah." Ethan was quiet for a moment. "Do you think Dad will ever come around?"

Sophia thought about Robert Price walking out of the courtroom without looking back. About the years of control documented in court papers. About the man who'd filed criminal charges against a teenager because she loved his son.

"I don't know," she said honestly. "Maybe. Eventually. But it's going to take a long time."

"I know." His voice was thick. "I keep thinking he'll call. That he'll text. That he'll realize he was wrong and apologize. But he won't, will he?"

"Probably not anytime soon."

"I chose this." Ethan's arms tightened around her. "I chose freedom over my relationship with him. And it was the right choice. I know it was. But god, it hurts."

"I know, baby. I know."

They stood there, holding each other in a delivery alley behind an Italian restaurant, and let themselves grieve what they'd lost even while celebrating what they'd won. Because both were true. Freedom had a cost, and even necessary choices left scars.

Finally, Ethan pulled back enough to look at her. His eyes were red but clear.

"I love you," he said. "I've been wanting to say that out loud, in person, not in a supervised phone call or a monitored text. Just... I love you."

"I love you too." Sophia reached up, wiping tears from his cheeks. "Four and a half months since I could say that to your face."

"January first. New Year's kiss on the balcony."

"Best kiss of my life."

"Yeah?" He smiled, that soft smile that was just for her. "Well, we've got time to top it now. No lawyers supervising. No court orders. No restrictions."

"Are you saying you want to kiss me, Ethan Price?"

"I'm saying I want to kiss you, Sophia Chen. But maybe not in an alley that smells like garbage."

She laughed. "Good call."

"Later though. Tonight. Jordan's having people over to celebrate. His parents are out of town and he's got that art studio with the roof access..."

"You want to kiss me on a roof?"

"I want to kiss you under the stars where no one can interrupt us and we can take our time."

Sophia's heart was racing. "That sounds perfect."

"Yeah?" His smile widened. "It's a date then. Our first real date. No supervision, no court orders, no countdown clock."

"Our first free date."

"Exactly." He kissed her forehead gently. "Come on. We should get back before they send a search party."

---

The afternoon dissolved into bureaucratic necessity. Paperwork. So much paperwork.

At Michael Chen's officebecause even on a Saturday, lawyers apparently workedEthan signed document after document officially establishing his emancipated status. Bank account transfers. Trust fund access. MIT housing confirmations. Medical power of attorney. Insurance changes. Phone plan transfers.

Sophia sat beside him through all of it, occasionally asking questions, mostly just being there. Her parents were there too, acting as temporary guardians for certain documents that required an adult signature until Ethan's paperwork processed fully on Monday.

"This is surreal," Ethan said, signing his name for the twentieth time. "I'm seventeen and I'm legally an adult."

"You've been acting like an adult for years," Michael said, reviewing a form. "Now it's just official."

"Does this mean I can vote?"

"Not until you're eighteen. Emancipation gives you legal autonomy, but some rights are still age-gated."

"Can I buy alcohol?"

"Also no."

"Can I get a tattoo?"

Michael looked up, eyebrow raised. "Technically yes. Are you planning to get a tattoo?"

"No. Just checking my newfound freedoms."

Sophia laughed. "This is the weirdest conversation."

"Welcome to emancipation law," Michael said dryly. "It's all weird conversations."

Around three-thirty, Ethan's MIT housing form came up. He stared at the line asking for his guardian information.

"Leave it blank," Michael advised. "Your emancipation order is attached. MIT already knows your situation."

Ethan left it blank, but Sophia saw his hand shake slightly. He'd spent seventeen years with parents, and now, legally, he had none.

She put her hand over his. He looked at her, managed a smile, kept signing.

By four o'clock, they were done. Ethan was officially, legally, permanently free.

"Congratulations," Michael said, shaking Ethan's hand. "You're now the youngest emancipated minor I've worked with who handled it with this much maturity."

"Thanks for everything, Mr. Chen. I literally couldn't have done this without you."

"You're welcome. Though I suspect you would have found a way." Michael glanced at his daughter. "He's stubborn. I wonder where that comes from."

"No idea," Sophia said innocently.

They gathered their copies of paperworkEthan had a folder an inch thick nowand headed back to Sophia's house. Ethan was technically living in a studio apartment he'd rented three months ago in anticipation of this, but he hadn't spent much time there yet.

"You should check your place," Sophia's mom suggested. "Make sure everything's okay. We've got some time before Jordan's party."

"Do you want to come with me?" Ethan asked Sophia. "Help me make sure I didn't forget to pay the electric bill or something?"

"Absolutely."

---

Ethan's studio apartment was in a building near the universitysmall but clean, the kind of place a student could afford with MIT scholarship money and a part-time job. He unlocked the door and they stepped inside.

It was sparse. A bed, a desk, a tiny kitchenette, a bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. But it was his. No parents hovering. No curfews. No rules except what he made.

"Home sweet home," Ethan said, flipping on the lights.

Sophia wandered around, taking it in. Textbooks on the deskadvanced physics, calculus, engineering fundamentals. A few photos tacked to the wall: him and his teammates, him at a science fair, one of him and Sophia from New Year's Eve that Jordan must have taken.

"You've got our picture up," she said, touching the frame.

"Of course I do. It's one of my favorite memories."

"The night we first kissed."

"The night I first admitted I was in love with you." He came up behind her, arms sliding around her waist. "Four and a half months ago. Feels like a lifetime."

"We've lived about three lifetimes since then."

They stood there, looking at the photo. Two teenagers in party clothes, laughing at something, champagne glasses raised in a New Year's toast. They looked so young. So innocent. So unaware of what was coming.

"I don't regret it," Ethan said quietly. "Any of it. Even the terrible parts. Because it led to this."

"Freedom?"

"Us. Together. Free." He turned her around to face him. "I'd do it all again if it meant getting here."

Sophia reached up, cupping his face. "Me too."

They kissed, soft and gentle. Not the desperate kisses from the courthouse hallway. Not the passionate make-out they'd shared in a motel room five months ago. Just... soft. Sweet. Them.

When they pulled apart, Ethan was smiling. "We're really doing this. MIT together. No more courts or lawyers or supervised visits. Just... us."

"Just us," Sophia agreed. "For the first time since January."

"Actually, for the first time ever." Ethan's expression turned serious. "We've never had just us. We went from childhood friends to separated by distance to reconnecting with my dad hovering. Then court cases and restrictions. We've never had normal."

"So what do we do now?"

"I guess we figure it out." He pulled out his phone. "Starting with this party. Jordan's been texting. Apparently half the school is coming."

Sophia groaned. "Do we have to? Can't we just stay here and order pizza and watch movies like normal people?"

"We could. But Jordan went to a lot of trouble, and honestly, I kind of want to celebrate. Big, loud, with friends. Dance badly, eat too much, just... be teenagers for one night before the summer gets complicated."

"The summer?"

"Moving to MIT. Packing. Saying goodbye." Ethan squeezed her hand. "Tonight, let's just be happy. We earned it."

She couldn't argue with that.

---

They spent the next hour getting readyEthan at his apartment, Sophia at her house. They texted back and forth, silly messages that made Sophia smile.

*What do you wear to a "you're legally free" party?*

*Probably not a suit. I'm sick of suits.*

*Jeans and that blue shirt?*

*The one you said matches my eyes?*

*That's the one ;)*

*Flirting with me, Chen?*

*Always, Price.*

Sophia stood in her room, trying to decide between dresses. The green one was pretty but maybe too fancy. The black one was safe but boring. The blue sundress was casual and...

Her phone rang. Ethan.

"Help," he said when she answered. "I own nothing but hockey jerseys and formal wear. What do normal people wear to parties?"

She laughed. "Jeans. T-shirt. You're overthinking this."

"What are you wearing?"

"Still deciding. What do you think, green dress or blue sundress?"

"The blue one. Definitely the blue one."

"You haven't even seen it."

"Don't have to. You always look beautiful." His voice softened. "But you could show up in a garbage bag and I'd still think you were the prettiest person there."

"That's the sappiest thing you've ever said."

"I've had an emotional day. I'm allowed to be sappy."

"Fair enough." Sophia pulled the blue dress from her closet. "Blue sundress it is. Pick me up at six?"

"It's a date."

They hung up, and Sophia got ready with more care than she'd taken in weeks. Shower. Hair dried and curled slightly. Minimal makeupjust enough to cover the stress shadows under her eyes. The blue dress fit perfectly, hitting just above her knees, comfortable but pretty.

Maya appeared in her doorway. "You look happy."

"I am happy." Sophia smiled at her sister. "For the first time in so long, I'm just... happy."

"Good. You deserve it." Maya held out a small bag. "I got you something. For tonight."

Sophia opened it. Inside was a delicate silver necklace with a tiny compass charm.

"So you always find your way," Maya said softly. "No matter what happens next."

Sophia's eyes filled with tears. Again. She was going to dehydrate at this rate. "Thank you. For everything. For this morning's bakery invasion, for the bathroom pep talk, for believing in me."

"Always, Soph. That's what sisters do."

They hugged, and Sophia felt the last of her fear dissolve. She had her family. She had Ethan. She had her freedom and her future and tonight, she had a party to attend.

At six o'clock exactly, Ethan knocked on her door.

He'd gone with the blue shirt and jeans, and Sophia was rightit did match his eyes. He looked tired but lighter somehow, like a weight had lifted.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi yourself." She stepped out, closing the door behind her. "Ready to celebrate?"

"With you? Always."

He held out his hand. She took it.

And they walked to his car together, ready for whatever came next.
