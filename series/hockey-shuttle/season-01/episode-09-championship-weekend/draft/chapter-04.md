# CHAPTER 4: THE KISS
## 7:00 PM - Midnight

---

Jordan's house was already packed by the time they arrived at seven.

Music poured through open windows, bass thumping loud enough to rattle the porch. Cars lined both sides of the streetteammates' trucks, friends' sedans, a few vehicles Sophia didn't recognize. Through the front window, she could see bodies moving, laughing, dancing.

Half the school, Jordan had said. He might have been underselling it.

Ethan hesitated at the door, hand still holding hers. "We can still bail. Get pizza, hide in my apartment, pretend this day didn't happen."

Sophia squeezed his fingers. "You want to celebrate. You said so."

"I know. But now that we're here..." He looked through the window at the crowd. "Everyone's going to want to talk about court. About my dad. About emancipation. I don't know if I can handle that yet."

"Then we don't talk about it." Sophia turned to face him. "We go in, we say hi to Jordan, we get food, we dance badly. If anyone asks about court, we say 'not tonight' and change the subject. And if it gets too much, we leave."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that. You're free now, remember? You don't owe anyone anything."

Ethan pulled her close, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "What did I do to deserve you?"

"Shared your granola bars in junior kindergarten."

He laughed, and some of the tension left his shoulders. "Okay. Let's do this. But if Marcus starts asking about legal fees"

"We're out of there."

"Deal."

They walked in together, hand in hand.

---

The immediate reaction was exactly what Sophia expected: everyone turning, someone yelling "THEY'RE HERE!", and then the entire room erupting in cheers.

Jordan appeared first, grinning like he'd won the lottery. "THE LEGALLY FREE MAN! AND HIS CRIMINALLY HOT GIRLFRIEND WHO IS NO LONGER FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES!"

"That's the worst introduction ever," Sophia said.

"I workshopped it." Jordan pulled them both into a hug. "Seriously though, congratulations. You guys did it. You actually did it."

More people crowded aroundteammates clapping Ethan on the back, Sophia's badminton friends hugging her, everyone talking at once about court and freedom and how amazing it all was. It was overwhelming but in a good way. These were their people. Their friends. Everyone who'd supported them through six weeks of legal hell.

Maya materialized with drinkssoda for both of them, because alcohol after the day they'd had seemed like a terrible idea. "To surviving!" she toasted.

"To freedom!" Jordan added.

Everyone raised their glasses. Sophia and Ethan caught each other's eyes across the circle of friends, both smiling.

They'd done it. They'd actually done it.

---

The next two hours passed in a blur of celebration.

Food appearedpizza, wings, someone's attempt at homemade nachos that was more cheese than chip. Sophia found herself starving, eating more than she had in weeks while surrounded by friends all talking about summer plans and MIT and how crazy the whole court situation had been.

"I still can't believe Robert just walked out," one of Ethan's teammates said. "Like, his son just won legal freedom and he couldn't even stick around to"

"We're not talking about that tonight," Sophia interrupted firmly. The guy looked chagrined.

"Right. Sorry, man."

"It's okay." Ethan's hand found Sophia's under the table. "Just... not tonight."

The conversation shifted to safer topics. Someone had brought a Dance Dance Revolution setupretro and ridiculousand soon there was a tournament happening. Ethan and Sophia teamed up against Maya and Jordan, both couples failing spectacularly and laughing too hard to care.

"You're terrible at this!" Maya yelled as Sophia missed another step.

"I'm a badminton player, not a dancer!"

"Clearly!"

Ethan was worse than Sophia, all hockey reflexes and zero rhythm. But he was laughing, genuinely laughing, and that was worth any amount of embarrassment.

When their song ended with a dismal score, they collapsed onto the couch together, breathless and grinning.

"We're never doing that again," Ethan said.

"Agreed."

Jordan appeared with his phone. "Okay, I need a photo for posterity. Legally free Ethan and criminally acquitted Sophia on the night of their victory."

They posed, Sophia leaning into Ethan's side, both of them smiling for real this time. Jordan snapped the picture and showed them.

They looked happy. Actually, genuinely happy. For the first time in months.

"That's going in my 'Wholesome Love Conquers Legal Bullshit' album," Jordan declared.

"You have an album for that?" Sophia asked.

"I do now."

---

By nine o'clock, the party had found its rhythm. Music playeda mix of current pop and throwback classics. People danced in the living room, clustered in conversation in the kitchen, spread out on the back patio. It was loud and chaotic and perfect.

Sophia found herself by the snack table, refilling her drink, when Emma appeared.

"You look happy," her badminton teammate said.

"I am happy."

"Good. You deserve it." Emma paused. "Can I ask you something? You don't have to answer if you don't want."

"Sure."

"This morning, when the deadline hit and you didn't drop him... were you scared?"

Sophia thought about standing in that courthouse at 8:59 AM, knowing that not recanting meant possible prosecution. About her lawyer's confidence that it was a bluff. About choosing Ethan anyway, even if it wasn't.

"Terrified," Sophia admitted. "But I couldn't drop him. Even if they'd gone through with charges, even if I'd ended up with a record, I couldn't abandon him. Not after everything."

Emma hugged her. "That's the most romantic and terrifying thing I've ever heard."

"Welcome to my life."

They laughed, and Sophia felt another layer of tension dissolve. She had good friends. She had people who understood. She was going to be okay.

Across the room, she caught Ethan's eye. He was talking to Marcus and some other teammates, but he'd been tracking her location all night. When their gazes met, he smiledthat soft, private smile that was just for her.

She smiled back.

*Later*, she mouthed.

He nodded, understanding. *Later.*

---

The dancing started in earnest around nine-thirty.

Someone turned up the music and suddenly the living room was packed with bodies moving, laughing, singing along to songs everyone knew. Sophia let Maya pull her into the chaos, both of them dancing terribly and not caring.

Ethan appeared beside her, moving with that careful self-consciousness of someone who'd spent more time on ice skates than dance floors. But he was trying, and he was smiling, and when Sophia grabbed his hands to spin him, he went with it.

"You're a terrible dancer!" she yelled over the music.

"I know!"

"I don't care!"

"Good!"

They danced like that for three songs, surrounded by friends, just being teenagers at a party. No courts. No lawyers. No life-altering decisions. Just music and movement and joy.

But Sophia kept noticing Ethan glancing toward the hallway. Toward the stairs that led to Jordan's art studio. Toward the roof access they'd talked about earlier.

During a slower song, he leaned in close. "Want to get some air?"

Her heart jumped. "Yeah. Let's go."

They slipped away from the crowd, nobody really noticing as they ducked into the quieter hallway. Jordan's art studio was at the top of a narrow staircase, the door propped open to let in the cool evening breeze.

As they climbed, Sophia noticed Jordan watching from across the room. He caught her eye, then deliberately looked at the stairs, then back at her. He nodded oncepermission granted, privacy respected.

She mouthed "thank you."

He grinned and turned back to the party.

---

The art studio was exactly as Sophia remembered from other partiespaint-splattered floors, canvases stacked against walls, the smell of turpentine and creativity. The skylight was propped open, ladder extended to the roof access.

"You weren't kidding about the roof," Sophia said.

"Jordan mentioned it earlier. Said we'd earned some privacy." Ethan tested the ladder. "You okay climbing?"

"In this dress? Might be interesting."

"I'll go first. Catch you if you fall."

"My hero," she teased, but she meant it.

Ethan climbed quickly, disappearing through the skylight. Then his face appeared, backlit by stars. "Come on. It's beautiful up here."

Sophia hiked up her sundress slightly and climbed. Her legs were shakingnot from exertion but from anticipation. They hadn't been truly alone, truly private, since January. Four and a half months of supervised visits and monitored calls and lawyers watching their every interaction.

Tonight, finally, it was just them.

Ethan helped her through the skylight, his hands warm and sure on her waist. The roof was flat, tar paper and gravel, with a low wall around the edges. The sky was that particular Winnipeg spring colornot quite dark yet at 9:30, but getting there, deep blue bleeding into purple.

Stars were starting to appear.

The city spread out below them, lights flickering on in windows and streetlamps. The party noise was muffled here, just bass and occasional laughter drifting up. Otherwise, quiet.

"Hi," Ethan said softly.

"Hi yourself." Sophia leaned against him, and he wrapped his arm around her shoulders, pulling her close. They stood like that for a moment, just breathing, just being.

Actually alone. No supervision. No rules. No threats hanging over their heads.

Free.

---

"How are you still standing?" Sophia asked. "We've been awake since five."

"Adrenaline. Also I think I'm too tired to sleep." His voice was rough, worn down by the long day. "You?"

"Same. My brain won't shut off." She tilted her head back to look at the stars. More appearing every minute. "We really did it."

"We really did." His arm tightened. "Judge Morrison, emancipation granted, everything."

"The criminal charges dropped."

"My mom leaving my dad."

"Caroline apologizing."

"MIT confirmed." His voice cracked slightly on those words. "Soph. We're *going to MIT together*."

She turned to face him properly, and something in her chest cracked openall the fear and tension and barely-held-together determination from the past four months. He was looking at her the way he'd been looking at her since January, since before January, since they were nine years old probably.

Like she was the answer to every question he'd ever asked.

"We survived," she whispered.

"Yeah." He reached up, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, his fingers lingering against her cheek. "We did."

"Your parents, the custody fight, criminal charges, all of it."

"Six weeks of no contact before that."

"Four and a half months of wanting this."

His thumb traced her cheekbone. "Every single day of those four and a half months."

The sunset light caught in his eyesbrown and gold and impossibly warm. She'd memorized every fleck, every shade, but somehow they were still surprising her. Still making her heart skip beats.

"What happens now?" she asked. Not scared, just... wondering. They'd been in survival mode so long.

"Now?" He smiled, slow and real. "Now we get to just... be together. No countdown. No checking over our shoulders. Just us."

"Just us," she repeated. Testing the words. They felt too good to be true.

"Tell me about MIT," he said. "What are you most excited about?"

She let herself lean into the question, into the future they'd finally earned. "The labs. Professor Yang's quantum computing research. The fact that we can get coffee at 2 AM when we're cramming for exams." She paused. "Walking across campus holding your hand."

His smile widened. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." She reached for his hand, laced their fingers together. "Public hand-holding. Revolutionary concept."

"We could do more than hold hands, you know." His voice dropped lower. "We're not breaking any rules anymore."

Her pulse jumped. "Radical idea."

"Pretty sure Jordan gave us this roof for a reason." He was closer now, or maybe she was, gravity pulling them together like they'd been orbiting for years and finally hit critical proximity.

"Smart friend."

"The smartest." His free hand came up to cup her face. "Sophia."

"Yeah?"

"I love you." The words were simple, but his voice carried everythingmonths of history, weeks of hell, every scared moment and brave choice and desperate hope. "I have loved you since I was nine years old. I loved you when we were apart. I loved you every day we couldn't be together. I loved you through everything, and I'm going to love you for everything that comes next."

Her eyes were burning. "Ethan."

"I'm not finished." His thumb brushed across her cheek, catching a tear she hadn't realized had fallen. "You are the bravest, smartest, most stubborn person I've ever met. You stood up to my parents. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. You didn't drop the charges even when facing jail. You're my best friend and you always have been and I" His voice cracked. "I never stopped loving you. Not for one single day."

She couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Every analytical bone in her body had dissolved.

"I love you," she managed. "I love you so much it doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to fall in love gradually, logically, but I think I loved you before I knew what the word meant. Every science competition, every hockey practice, every time you smiled at me like I was the only person in the world who mattered"

"You were. You are."

"I've been in love with you my entire life." The words were tumbling out now, unstoppable. "When you left, I thought I'd lost my chance. When we found each other again, I thought it was impossible. When your parents tried to take you away, I thought I'd break. But here we are. We're here, and we're free, and I love you. I love you."

"Sophia." His forehead touched hers. They were breathing the same air. "Can I kiss you?"

"Please."

---

The first touch of his lips was gentlequestioning, careful, like she might disappear. She pressed closer, answering, telling him without words that she was real, they were real, this was finally, actually happening.

He made a soft sound and deepened the kiss, his hand sliding into her hair, and oh*oh*. This was different than the New Year's kiss, that stolen moment in public, quick and desperate and interrupted. This was private. Ours. No one watching, no one interrupting, nothing but them and the darkening sky and the rest of their lives spreading out ahead.

She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer, and he responded by banding his arm around her waist, holding her like she was precious, like she was everything. His lips were soft and warm and tasted slightly like the soda he'd been drinking. His hand in her hair sent shivers down her spine. Her heart was racing so fast she could hear it, feel it, every beat saying *yes yes yes finally yes*.

They broke apart for air, and he laughedpure joy, unfilteredand then they were kissing again. Slower this time, learning each other. The angle of his jaw under her palm. The way his breath hitched when she kissed the corner of his mouth. The solid warmth of him against her, real and here and hers.

"Sophia," he breathed against her lips.

"Don't stop."

"Never." He kissed her again, and again, and she stopped counting. Stopped thinking. Just feltthe rough texture of his shirt under her hands, the gentle pressure of his fingers tracing patterns on her back, the taste of him, the smell of his cologne, the sound of his breathing mixing with mine.

Above them, stars were appearing in earnest now, the sky fully dark. Below, the city lights twinkled, distant and separate from their world. The roof, this moment, belonged only to them.

"I love you," she said again, between kisses. Couldn't stop saying it. Four and a half months of holding back.

"I love you." Kiss. "I love you." Another kiss. "Never letting you go."

"Good." She pulled back just enough to look at himhis eyes dark and bright, his smile soft and real, his expression completely open. Vulnerable and trusting and *happy*. "Because you're stuck with me now. You know that, right?"

"Best fate I can imagine." He tucked her hair back, his touch reverent. "You and me. MIT. Whatever comes after."

"Everything that comes after."

"Everything," he agreed.

They kissed again, softer now, gentler. Not desperate or rushed. They had time. They had the whole summer. They had MIT. They had years ahead of them, no more countdowns or deadlines or threats.

They had each other, finally, completely, freely.

She could feel him smiling against her lips. Started smiling too. The kiss dissolved into laughterbreathless, joyful, probably slightly unhinged from exhaustion and relief and too many emotions to process.

"We're really doing this," she said.

"We really are." He rested his forehead against hers again. "No more hiding. No more rules. Just us."

"Just us," she echoed.

They stayed like that for a whileminutes or hours, time had stopped meaning anythingholding each other, trading kisses, watching stars appear. His fingers traced patterns on her spine. Her hand found its way to his hair, running through the soft strands. Every touch felt significant, precious. They'd fought so hard for this.

"We should probably go back down eventually," he murmured, though he made no move to let go. "People will notice we're gone."

"Let them notice." She kissed him again. "Jordan gave us this roof. I'm using it."

He laughed against her lips. "No arguments here."

But eventuallyreluctantlythey did pull apart. The party sounds drifted up from below, reminding them of the real world. Friends who loved them. Family they'd chosen. A future they'd earned.

"One more kiss," he said.

"One more."

It wasn't just one. It was three, then four, then she lost count again. But finally, they made it to the ladder. He climbed down first, then helped her down, his hands on her waist as she descended.

On the studio floor, he pulled her close again, kissed her forehead, her nose, her lips once more.

"Ready?" he asked.

She laced her fingers with his. "With you? Always."

---

They walked back to the party together, hand in hand, and everything was different.

The same people, the same room, but they'd crossed some invisible threshold. Changed in ways that would keep unfolding.

Jordan caught her eye when they emerged, and his smile was knowing and warm. Marcus wolf-whistled until Emma elbowed him. Maya grinned like she'd won a bet.

But Sophia barely noticed any of it. Because Ethan's hand was in hers, solid and real and public. Because they could stand together without counting minutes or checking phones or worrying about who was watching.

Because they were free.

And they were together.

Finally, actually, completely together.

---

The party continued around them, the celebration taking on new energy. Someone cranked up the music. More dancing. More laughter. Sophia and Ethan moved through it all hand in hand, occasionally separating to talk to friends but always gravitating back together.

Around eleven, Sophia found herself on the back patio with Maya and Emma, catching their breath from dancing.

"You're glowing," Maya observed.

"Am I?"

"Absolutely. It's disgusting. Also adorable." Maya nudged her. "Good kiss?"

"The best."

"Better than New Year's?"

"So much better." Sophia couldn't stop smiling. "Because this time, we're free. No supervision, no countdown, no wondering when we'll get caught. Just... us."

Emma sighed happily. "That's beautiful. I want what you have."

"You'll find it," Sophia assured her. "When you least expect it."

They talked for a while about summer plans, about MIT, about the upcoming school year. Normal teenager conversations. It felt surreal after months of legal drama.

Eventually, Sophia excused herself to find Ethan. She wandered back inside, through the kitchen, and was about to check the living room when she heard his voice from the front hallway.

He was on his phone.

"I understand," he was saying. "Yes. Thank you for calling."

Sophia paused, not wanting to interrupt. But something in his tone made her stomach tighten.

Ethan hung up and stood there, staring at his phone.

"Ethan?" She approached carefully. "You okay?"

He looked up, and his expression was... she couldn't read it. Shocked? Confused? Both?

"That was... that was a scout. From the Detroit Red Wings."

The room suddenly felt too small.

"What did they want?"

"They want to talk to me. About a contract." His voice was flat, disconnected. "They said they've been following my season. That my emancipation status makes me eligible for earlier entry. They want to meet next week."

Sophia's heart was pounding. "A contract? Like, a professional contract?"

"Yeah." He laughed, but it sounded wrong. "An NHL contract. The thing I've been training for my whole life. The thing I gave up for MIT."

"But you chose MIT."

"I know. I did. I" He ran his hand through his hair. "They said it's not an either-or. That they have a program for academically gifted players. Modified enrollment. I could play hockey October through April and attend MIT May through August. Five years instead of four, but I'd get both."

The words hit like a physical blow. Both. He could have both.

Everything they'd fought forMIT together, choosing education over hockey, freedom from his father's dreamsand there was a third option all along?

"Did you know this existed?" Sophia asked carefully.

"No. God, no. If I'd known..." He trailed off, looking sick. "We fought so hard. You faced criminal charges. I sued my own father. And maybe we didn't have to choose at all."

They stared at each other. The party continued around them, music and laughter and celebration, but it felt very far away.

"What are you going to do?" Sophia whispered.

"I don't know." His voice cracked. "This morning I was sure. MIT, engineering, building something real instead of chasing Dad's dream. But Soph, what if it wasn't just Dad's dream? What if part of me still wants this?"

"Then you should consider it."

"But what about us? What about MIT together? What about"

"Hey." She stepped close, taking his hands. "We'll figure it out. Together. Okay?"

"Okay," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.

His phone buzzed again. He glanced at it, and his face went pale.

"What is it?"

"Email. From the Red Wings. Contract details." He scrolled, reading. "Signing bonus of two and a half million dollars. Base salary of three point two million per year. Three years guaranteed."

The numbers were staggering. Life-changing. Everything his parents had wanted for him.

"When do they need an answer?"

"June first. Two weeks."

Two weeks to decide between the life they'd planned and the dream he'd thought he'd given up.

Two weeks to figure out if choosing each other meant being apart half the year.

Two weeks to determine if this perfect day ended with everything falling apart.

Sophia looked at Ethanat the boy she'd loved since they were nine, at the young man who'd fought for freedom, at her best friend and partner and the person she wanted to build a life with.

And she saw the uncertainty in his eyes.

For months, their path had been clear. Difficult, yes. Painful, absolutely. But clear. MIT or NHL. Education or money. Each other or his parents' dreams.

Now the path forked into territories they'd never mapped. Detroit winters and Cambridge summers. Professional athlete and MIT student. Everything they'd wanted, but divided, separated, split between two impossible lives.

"We should go," Ethan said quietly. "I need to think. Process."

"Okay."

They found Jordan, thanked him for the party, made excuses about being tired. Jordan looked between them, sensing something was wrong, but didn't push.

"Text me tomorrow?" he said to Ethan.

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

They walked to Ethan's car in silence. The drive to Sophia's house felt endless and too short all at once.

When he pulled up to her driveway, they sat for a moment, neither moving.

"I'm sorry," Ethan finally said. "After tonight, after the roof, after everything"

"Don't apologize. This is huge. You need to consider it."

"But what about us?"

"We'll figure it out." She tried to sound confident. "We always do."

He leaned across the console, kissing her softly. It tasted different than the roof kisses. This one tasted like uncertainty.

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too."

She got out of the car and walked to her door. When she turned back, he was still sitting there, phone in his hand, staring at the email that had just complicated everything.

---

Inside, Sophia leaned against the closed door, trying to process.

This morning: criminal charges and emancipation hearing.

This afternoon: freedom and paperwork.

This evening: the perfect kiss under the stars.

And now: an NHL contract offer that changed everything.

Her phone buzzed. Ethan.

*I love you. That hasn't changed. Sleep well.*

She stared at the message, then typed back.

*I love you too. We'll figure it out.*

Hit send.

But as she climbed the stairs to her room, as she changed out of her blue sundress and washed off her makeup, as she lay in bed staring at the ceiling, one thought kept circling:

Had they fought for nothing? Had the sacrifice been unnecessary? Could they have had everything without the pain?

And more terrifying: what if Ethan chose the NHL? What if he chose hockey over MIT, over her, over the future they'd planned together?

What if today's victory was already turning into tomorrow's loss?

She rolled over, looking at the compass necklace Maya had given her. *So you always find your way.*

But what if she didn't know which way to go?

What if there was no right answer anymore?
