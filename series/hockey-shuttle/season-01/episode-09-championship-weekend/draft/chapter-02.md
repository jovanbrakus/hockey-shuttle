# CHAPTER 2: THE HEARING
## 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM

---

The moment the judge's gavel fell, dismissing the criminal charges, Sophia felt her knees go weak.

Free.

She wasn't going to jail. She wasn't going to have a criminal record. She wasn't going to lose MIT.

And she hadn't dropped Ethan.

"Told you," Lisa Huang said quietly, gathering her files with the satisfaction of someone who'd been absolutely certain of the outcome. "Political theater."

Sophia turned in her seat, looking across the courtroom to where Ethan sat in the back row. He was staring at her, eyes wet, hands pressed together like he'd been praying. When their gazes met, his entire face transformed—relief so profound it was almost painful to witness.

She smiled.

He smiled back.

"We have ten minutes before the emancipation hearing," Lisa said, standing. "Use them wisely."

Sophia didn't need to be told twice.

---

The courthouse hallway was chaos—media shouting questions, protesters still chanting outside, families congratulating each other. But Sophia only saw one person.

Ethan was already moving toward her, weaving through the crowd. Jordan Nakamura was trailing behind him, grinning. Maya grabbed Sophia's arm. "Go. We'll give you space."

Then Ethan was in front of her.

Six weeks. Forty-two days. One thousand and eight hours.

"Hi," she said. Her voice came out shaky.

"Hi."

And then his hands were in hers, warm and real and solid, and she was stepping forward into his arms. He wrapped around her immediately, pulling her close, and for the first time in six weeks she could breathe properly.

She was crying. So was he.

"You didn't drop me," he whispered against her hair.

"I wasn't going to. Ever."

"Thank you. God, Soph, thank you."

She pulled back enough to see his face. He looked exhausted—shadows under his eyes, tension in his jaw, the kind of tired that came from weeks of sustained fear. But he was here. Holding her. Free to touch her without lawyers monitoring them.

"I'm getting emancipated today," he said. "Right now. Ten minutes."

"I know." She squeezed his hands. "I'm going to testify if they need me."

"You don't have to—"

"Yes, I do." Her voice was firm. "After everything your father tried? I'm testifying about exactly who you are and why you deserve freedom."

Something flashed in his eyes—gratitude, love, something too big for words. He pulled her close again, and she let herself have this moment. Just ten minutes of touching him, holding him, feeling his heartbeat against her cheek.

It wasn't enough. It would never be enough.

But in ten minutes, if the judge ruled in their favor, they'd have forever.

"Ethan," Michael Chen called. "We need to prep."

"Sophia," her dad said from somewhere behind her. "Come on, honey."

They separated reluctantly. Ethan's hands were the last thing to let go, fingers sliding through hers until only their fingertips touched, then nothing.

"See you in there," he said.

"Win this."

"I will."

She watched him walk away with Michael Chen, Jordan following. Then Maya was at her elbow, steering her toward another conference room where Lisa was waiting.

"That was adorable," Maya said. "Also, you both look like you haven't slept in six weeks."

"We haven't."

"Fair."

---

At ten AM exactly, Judge Morrison entered the courtroom.

Sophia sat in the gallery with her family—Mom on one side, Maya on the other, Dad in the row behind them. Across the aisle, she could see Robert Price with his legal team: two lawyers in expensive suits and a PR person taking notes.

Caroline Price sat between the two sides, alone. She looked small in the courtroom's harsh fluorescent light. When Ethan entered with Michael Chen, Caroline's face crumpled briefly before she composed herself.

Ethan took his seat at the petitioner's table. He didn't look at Robert.

Robert was staring at him with an expression Sophia couldn't quite read—anger, yes, but also something that looked almost like grief.

Judge Morrison settled at her bench, reviewing papers. She was a Black woman in her fifties with an air of someone who had seen everything twice and wasn't impressed by theatrics. Sophia recognized her from the February hearing where she'd granted conditional contact. She'd been fair then. Penetrating questions, but fair.

Please let her be fair now.

"Please be seated," Judge Morrison said. The courtroom rustled as everyone sat. "We're here for the emancipation petition filed by Ethan Price, age seventeen, seeking legal emancipation from his father, Robert Price. I've reviewed the petition, supporting documents, and psychological evaluation. We'll begin with opening statements. Mr. Price, you're opposing this petition. Your counsel may proceed."

Robert's lead lawyer stood—tall, silver-haired, the kind of lawyer you hired when money was no object.

"Your Honor, this case is about a father who has dedicated thirteen years of his life to his son's success. Robert Price moved his family to Winnipeg when Ethan was nine years old, specifically to provide access to superior hockey training. He has invested countless hours and substantial financial resources into developing Ethan's athletic career. My client has sacrificed his own career opportunities, his marriage, his entire life, to give his son the best possible future."

Sophia felt her jaw clench. Sacrificed his marriage? Caroline was sitting right there, and it was pretty clear whose choice that separation had been.

"This petition," the lawyer continued, "is not about mature independence. It's about teenage infatuation. Ethan met a young woman last fall—a woman eleven months his senior—and became involved in a relationship that has fundamentally altered his life trajectory. He has abandoned a potential professional hockey career, worth millions of dollars, to attend MIT with this young woman. This is not reasoned decision-making. This is adolescent impulsivity."

Maya made a small, angry sound beside Sophia.

"Furthermore," the lawyer said, "emancipation would be financially devastating for Ethan. While he claims to have means of support through MIT's scholarship program, that program is contingent on maintaining academic standards and work-study participation. He has no savings, no assets, no backup plan. Granting emancipation would place a seventeen-year-old at financial risk for no purpose except teenage rebellion."

The lawyer sat down. Robert looked satisfied.

Judge Morrison turned to Michael Chen. "Mr. Chen, you're representing the petitioner. Opening statement?"

Dad stood. Sophia had seen him in court before—he taught law and occasionally consulted on cases—but never like this. Never representing someone she loved.

"Your Honor, this case is about a young man's right to choose his own future. Ethan Price is seventeen years, nine months old. In less than three months, he will be a legal adult regardless of this ruling. The question before you isn't whether he will eventually have autonomy—it's whether he should be required to endure three more months of parental control that has been, according to expert testimony, psychologically harmful."

Michael pulled out a document. "Dr. Sarah Martinez, court-appointed psychologist, conducted three extensive sessions with Ethan and reviewed his family history. Her conclusion: 'Ethan Price demonstrates exceptional maturity and clear autonomous decision-making capabilities. His relationship with his father exhibits patterns consistent with emotional manipulation and control that would benefit from legal separation.' Those are her words, Your Honor. A professional assessment."

Judge Morrison made a note.

"Regarding the relationship with my daughter, Sophia Chen," Dad continued—and Sophia felt a weird jolt hearing herself mentioned clinically in court—"Ethan applied to MIT in December, before their relationship became romantic in January. His academic record shows consistent excellence in mathematics and physics since elementary school, predating any contact with Sophia by eight years. This isn't abandoning hockey for a girl. This is choosing academics after years of being denied that choice."

"Financially, Ethan has secured a full scholarship to MIT including room, board, and a work-study program that will provide income. He has summer employment lined up. He has means of support that don't require parental assistance. This petition isn't about a teenager running away from responsibility. It's about a young man running toward the future he's earned the right to choose."

Michael sat down. Ethan was staring at the table, but Sophia could see the tension in his shoulders.

"We'll hear testimony," Judge Morrison said. "Mr. Price, call your first witness."

Robert's lawyer stood. "We call Robert Price to the stand."

---

Watching Robert testify was surreal.

He sat in the witness box looking composed, almost sympathetic. When his lawyer asked him to describe his relationship with Ethan, his voice was calm and measured—the voice of a reasonable man being unreasonably attacked.

"I've dedicated my life to giving Ethan opportunities I never had," Robert said. "I grew up in a small town with limited resources. When I saw Ethan's potential in hockey at age four, I promised myself I would do everything possible to help him succeed. Everything."

"Can you describe what 'everything' entailed?" the lawyer asked.

"We moved to Winnipeg when he was nine so he could train with the best AAA program in Manitoba. I took a lower-paying job to make that possible. I drove him to practices at five AM, tournaments every weekend, summer camps across Canada and the United States. I paid for private coaching, equipment, nutritionists, everything a developing athlete needs."

"And what was Ethan's trajectory before this relationship began?"

"He was being scouted by NHL teams. First-round draft projection. Full scholarship offers from Division One programs. He had a future in professional hockey—the dream we'd worked toward for thirteen years."

"What changed?"

Robert's expression tightened. "Sophia Chen moved to Winnipeg last fall for her junior year. She and Ethan knew each other as children, before we moved. When they reconnected, everything changed."

"How so?"

"He started skipping practices. His focus shifted from hockey to spending time with her. He stopped communicating with me about college decisions—I found out he'd applied to MIT only when the acceptance letter arrived. When I tried to discuss his future, he became defensive, secretive. The relationship became his entire focus."

Sophia wanted to stand up and scream that wasn't how it happened. But she sat still, Maya's hand tight in hers.

"Mr. Price, why do you oppose emancipation?"

Robert looked directly at Ethan for the first time. "Because I love my son. Because I've spent thirteen years preparing him for success, and I'm watching him throw it away. If he's emancipated, he'll have no guidance, no support system. When this relationship ends—and teenage relationships do end—he'll be alone and adrift, having sacrificed everything for infatuation."

"Thank you, Mr. Price."

Judge Morrison looked at Michael Chen. "Cross-examination?"

Dad stood. "Mr. Price, when did Ethan first express interest in science and mathematics?"

Robert frowned. "I don't know. Elementary school, maybe."

"According to his academic records, he participated in math competitions at age nine and ten. Do you remember that?"

"Vaguely."

"Did you attend any of those competitions?"

Pause. "No. They conflicted with hockey."

"When did Ethan tell you he was interested in engineering as a career?"

"He didn't. That came from Sophia."

"Actually," Michael said, pulling out another document, "Ethan's eighth-grade career assessment—four years ago, two years before reconnecting with Sophia—listed his top career interest as 'engineer or physicist.' Were you aware of that?"

Robert's jaw tightened. "He was thirteen. Kids change their minds."

"Indeed. Did he change his mind, or did you tell him hockey was his future?"

"I guided him toward his strength."

"Did you ask what he wanted?"

Silence.

"Mr. Price, have you ever asked Ethan what he wants for his own future, separate from what you want for him?"

"I know what's best for my son."

"That's not what I asked."

Judge Morrison leaned forward. "Mr. Price, please answer the question."

Robert looked at her, then at Michael, then at Ethan. "Everything I've done has been for him."

"And yet," Michael said quietly, "he's sitting in this courtroom petitioning to legally separate from you. Does that suggest your assessment of what's best might differ from his?"

"Objection," Robert's lawyer said. "Argumentative."

"Sustained. Move on, Mr. Chen."

Michael nodded. "No further questions."

Robert stepped down, his composure cracked. Caroline was crying silently in her seat.

---

"The petitioner calls Ethan Price to the stand."

Sophia watched Ethan rise and walk to the witness box. He looked terrified and determined in equal measure. When he took the oath, his voice was steady.

Michael approached gently. "Ethan, why are you seeking emancipation?"

Ethan took a breath. "Because I need—I need to be free to choose my own future."

"Can you elaborate?"

"My father decided I would play professional hockey when I was four years old." Ethan's voice was calm, but Sophia could hear the tremor underneath. "I don't remember asking for that. I don't remember choosing it. I remember being told that hockey was what I was good at, what I was meant to do, what our family had sacrificed for. And I loved playing—I still do. But I never got to decide if it was what I wanted for my life."

As Ethan spoke, Sophia felt something tighten in her chest. This was the boy who'd shared his granola bars with her in kindergarten when she'd forgotten her snack. Who'd built LEGOs with her for hours, constructing elaborate spaceships and explaining how they'd fly. Who'd won the district science fair at age nine with a project about friction and then never competed again because hockey tournaments took precedence.

She'd known him before Robert had decided who he'd be. She'd known the version of Ethan that existed before hockey became everything.

And watching him sit in that witness box, finally saying the words he'd needed to say for years, she felt pride and heartbreak in equal measure.

"When did that change?" Michael asked.

"When I reconnected with Sophia last fall." Ethan glanced at her briefly, then back at the judge. His eyes were bright, focused. "We were friends when we were nine. She reminded me that I used to love science, math, building things. That I used to talk about being an engineer. I'd forgotten that part of myself because there was only room for hockey in my life."

Sophia wanted to reach across the courtroom and touch him. Just rest her hand on his shoulder so he'd know she was there, that he wasn't alone. But all she could do was sit perfectly still and watch him be brave.

"What happened when you expressed interest in MIT?"

"My father told me I was being manipulated. That Sophia was distracting me from hockey. He started monitoring my phone, reading my texts, tracking where I went. When I applied to MIT anyway, he deleted my applications. I had to resubmit them from school computers."

Sophia saw the way Ethan's hands tightened on the edge of the witness box. The slight tremble in his fingers. He was terrified, she realized. Absolutely terrified of speaking against his father in public like this.

But he was doing it anyway.

God, she loved him.

"Did he attempt to control the relationship itself?"

"Yes. He offered Sophia money—an eighty-thousand-dollar scholarship—to stop seeing me and go to a different college."

Murmurs in the courtroom. Robert's face flushed.

"When that didn't work, he filed criminal charges against her." Ethan's voice hardened. "She was facing prison time for dating me—someone eleven months younger. That's when I knew I had to get emancipated. Because a father who would use the law as a weapon against someone his son loves isn't protecting him. He's controlling him."

Judge Morrison was watching Ethan intently, her expression unreadable.

Sophia's heart was hammering. She could see the fear in Ethan's eyes, the way he kept glancing at Robert and then away, like he couldn't quite bear to look directly at what he was doing. Testifying against his father. Asking a court to sever the legal tie between them.

This was costing him everything.

And he was paying it for both of them.

"Ethan," Michael said, "do you love your father?"

The question clearly surprised him. Ethan blinked, his composure wavering. "I... yes. I think so. But I can't—I can't live under his control anymore."

"Why not?"

"Because he doesn't see me as a person. He sees me as a project. And I need—" His voice cracked slightly. "I need to be my own person before it's too late."

Michael nodded. "Thank you. No further questions."

Robert's lawyer stood. "Mr. Price—sorry, Ethan—you're seventeen years old. You've never lived independently, held a job, paid bills. How do you expect to support yourself?"

"MIT scholarship covers tuition and housing. Work-study provides income for personal expenses. I've already been accepted into the program."

"Work-study pays approximately twelve dollars an hour. Have you budgeted for books, food, transportation, emergencies?"

"Yes. Michael Chen helped me create a budget. I'll make about three thousand dollars through summer employment, which covers moving costs and initial expenses. After that, work-study covers ongoing needs."

"What if you get sick? What if there's an emergency?"

"MIT provides health insurance. I'll have savings for emergencies."

"What if you fail out? Academic scholarships require maintaining GPA standards."

"I won't fail out."

"How can you be certain?"

"Because I've maintained a 4.0 GPA while training for hockey twenty hours a week and dealing with my father's legal attacks on my girlfriend. I think I can handle college."

Several people in the gallery laughed. Judge Morrison hid a smile.

Sophia felt a surge of fierce pride. That was her Ethan—quiet until pushed, then absolutely unmovable.

The lawyer changed tactics. "You claim this relationship with Sophia Chen isn't influencing your decisions. But you applied to the same school, plan to live in the same city, have coordinated your entire future with hers. Doesn't that suggest dependence?"

"We applied to the same school because we have the same academic interests. We both want to study engineering. We both love math and physics. That's not dependence—that's shared goals."

"But if the relationship ends—"

"I'll still want to study engineering. I'll still want to go to MIT. Sophia isn't why I want those things. She just reminded me that I was allowed to want them."

The lawyer tried a few more angles, but Ethan held firm. When he finally stepped down, Sophia wanted to cheer.

He didn't look at Robert as he returned to his seat. Robert was staring at the table, jaw clenched.

Caroline was watching Ethan with an expression of profound sadness and what looked like regret.

---

"We call Dr. Sarah Martinez."

The psychologist was a woman in her forties with kind eyes and professional demeanor. She took the stand calmly.

"Dr. Martinez," Michael said, "you conducted a court-ordered evaluation of Ethan Price. Can you summarize your findings?"

"I met with Ethan for three sessions totaling approximately eight hours. I also reviewed his academic records, medical history, and interviewed relevant parties including teachers and coaches. My assessment is that Ethan demonstrates exceptional maturity for his age, clear autonomous thinking, and well-developed future planning capabilities."

"In your professional opinion, is he emotionally prepared for emancipation?"

"Yes. In fact, I believe emancipation would be psychologically beneficial. The current parent-child dynamic exhibits patterns consistent with enmeshment and emotional manipulation. Legal separation would allow Ethan to develop independent identity formation, which is crucial at his developmental stage."

"Can you elaborate on 'enmeshment'?"

"It's a family dynamic where a parent's identity becomes overly intertwined with a child's achievements. The parent begins to view the child's successes as their own, and the child's choices as threats to the parent's self-worth. This creates a control dynamic that inhibits healthy development."

"Did you observe this in the Price family?"

"Yes. Robert Price has invested substantial time and resources in Ethan's hockey career—which isn't inherently problematic. But he's also expressed that Ethan's choices feel like personal betrayal. That's enmeshment. Ethan's autonomy threatens Robert's sense of identity."

"What about the relationship with Sophia Chen? Did you assess whether she's manipulating him?"

"I did. I found no evidence of manipulation. Their relationship appears to be age-appropriate, consensual, and mutually supportive. Sophia has her own achievements and identity separate from Ethan. They function as partners, not as manipulator and victim."

"Thank you, Dr. Martinez."

Robert's lawyer stood for cross-examination. "Dr. Martinez, you only met with Ethan three times. How can you assess thirteen years of family dynamics from eight hours?"

"I also reviewed extensive documentation and interviewed multiple sources. Eight hours of clinical assessment combined with corroborating evidence provides a comprehensive picture."

"But you never lived with this family. You don't know what happens behind closed doors."

"That's true of every psychological evaluation. I work with the evidence available."

"Is it possible that a seventeen-year-old boy infatuated with an older girl might present a biased narrative?"

"It's possible. That's why I interviewed other sources and reviewed objective records. The pattern was consistent across all sources."

"But you can't know for certain."

"Nothing in psychology is certain. I can tell you that in fifteen years of conducting these evaluations, Ethan Price is one of the most thoughtful, mature petitioners I've assessed."

The lawyer tried a few more questions but got nowhere. Dr. Martinez was unshakeable.

When she stepped down, Sophia felt hope fluttering in her chest. The expert testimony was powerful.

Maybe they actually had a chance.

---

"I'd like to call Sophia Chen to speak."

Sophia's head jerked up. She looked at her father, who nodded encouragingly.

Robert's lawyer was on his feet. "Objection, Your Honor. Ms. Chen isn't party to this petition."

"She's relevant to the petitioner's circumstances," Michael said. "The relationship is central to Mr. Price's opposition."

Judge Morrison considered. "I'll allow it. Ms. Chen, please take the stand."

Sophia's legs felt shaky as she walked to the witness box. She could feel everyone watching her—Robert's angry glare, Caroline's tearful gaze, Ethan's worried eyes.

She took the oath and sat down.

Michael smiled at her gently. "Sophia, did you manipulate Ethan into choosing MIT?"

"No." Her voice came out stronger than she felt. "I barely talked about MIT with him until after he'd already decided to apply."

"Can you describe your relationship?"

"We were childhood friends when we were nine. We reconnected last fall when my family moved to Winnipeg. We started studying together, talking about school, spending time skating. The relationship—it developed naturally over several months."

"Did you encourage him to give up hockey?"

"No. I didn't even know he was considering it until he told me he'd applied to MIT. He made that decision independently."

"What role did you play in his college decisions?"

Sophia took a breath, trying to organize her thoughts. In the gallery, she could see Maya giving her an encouraging nod.

"I supported his choices the same way he supported mine. When I was deciding between badminton and academics, he told me I could do both. When he was deciding between hockey and MIT, I told him the same thing. We don't—we don't make each other's choices. We support each other's right to choose."

Michael nodded. "When Robert Price offered you eighty thousand dollars to stop seeing Ethan and attend a different college, what did you do?"

"I said no."

"Why?"

"Because choosing my own future means choosing all of it. The school I attend, the sport I play, and the person I love. I wasn't going to let anyone pay me to give up part of my life."

"Even though it meant facing criminal charges?"

Sophia looked directly at Robert. "Even then. Because what Ethan and I have isn't manipulation. It's partnership. And you can't buy your way out of that."

Robert looked away.

Michael sat down. "No further questions."

Robert's lawyer approached. Sophia braced herself.

"Ms. Chen, you're eighteen years old and Ethan is seventeen. That's illegal in Manitoba."

"By eleven months. We didn't plan our birthdays."

"But you knew it was illegal when the relationship became physical?"

Sophia felt her face heat. "We haven't—our relationship isn't—that's not relevant."

"The criminal charges suggest otherwise."

"The criminal charges were dropped this morning because they were baseless."

"But they were filed. That suggests—"

"It suggests Robert Price was willing to use the law as a weapon to control his son's life. That's exactly why Ethan needs emancipation."

Judge Morrison looked impressed. "Ms. Chen makes a fair point."

The lawyer tried a different angle. "You're a competitive athlete yourself, correct? National champion in badminton?"

"Yes."

"Don't you think Ethan is giving up a similar opportunity by choosing MIT over professional hockey?"

"No. I think he's choosing a different opportunity. Hockey isn't the only valid path to success."

"But he could play professional hockey and earn millions—"

"He could also study engineering and design things that change the world. Why is one future more valuable than the other?"

"Because one pays significantly more."

"Money isn't the only measure of value."

"Easy to say when you're not giving up millions."

"I'm not giving up anything," Sophia said firmly. "Neither is Ethan. We're choosing what we want, not what other people think we should want. That's not sacrifice. That's freedom."

The courtroom was silent.

"No further questions," the lawyer said quietly.

As Sophia stepped down, she caught Ethan's eye. He was looking at her like she'd just done something miraculous.

She sat back down between Mom and Maya. Her hands were shaking, but she felt oddly calm.

She'd told the truth. That was all she could do.

---

"I'd like to call Caroline Price to the stand."

The courtroom went still. Sophia felt Maya grip her hand.

Caroline stood slowly, smoothing her blouse with trembling fingers. She walked to the witness box like she was walking to her own sentencing.

When she took the oath, her voice was barely audible.

Michael approached carefully. "Mrs. Price, can you describe your son's relationship with his father?"

Caroline looked at Ethan, then away. "Robert loves Ethan very much. He's always loved him. But..."

"But?"

"But Robert has difficulty separating what's best for Ethan from what Robert wants for himself." Her voice grew slightly stronger. "When Ethan was four and showed talent for hockey, Robert saw a path. A way to give Ethan everything he never had. And it became—it became everything. Our whole lives revolved around hockey."

"Did you support that focus?"

"At first, yes. I thought we were helping Ethan. Building his future. But over the years, I watched my son become quieter. More withdrawn. Like he was disappearing into the role we'd built for him."

Sophia saw Ethan's hands clench on the table in front of him.

"When did you recognize this was a problem?" Michael asked.

"Last fall, when Sophia came back into his life." Caroline smiled slightly through her tears. "Suddenly Ethan was laughing again. Talking about math and science like he used to when he was little. I saw glimpses of the boy I'd forgotten he used to be. And I realized we'd taken something from him."

"Did you discuss this with your husband?"

"I tried. Robert said it was infatuation. That Sophia was distracting Ethan from his future. But I could see—she wasn't distracting him. She was reminding him who he was."

"Mrs. Price, do you support Ethan's petition for emancipation?"

Caroline looked directly at Ethan. "Yes."

Robert made a sound—half anger, half disbelief. His lawyer put a hand on his arm.

"Can you explain why?" Michael asked gently.

"Because my son deserves to choose his own life. Because I love him enough to let him go. Because..." Her voice broke. "Because I should have protected him from this years ago, and I didn't. This is me trying to make that right."

"Thank you, Mrs. Price."

Robert's lawyer stood for cross-examination, but Judge Morrison held up a hand. "I think we've heard enough. Mrs. Price, you may step down."

Caroline walked back to her seat, tears streaming down her face. As she passed Robert, he wouldn't look at her.

---

"I'd like to call Michael Chen to testify about MIT's financial aid package."

Dad took the stand briefly, explaining the scholarship terms, work-study details, and budget projections. It was dry testimony, but important—proving that Ethan had concrete means of support.

Then Robert's lawyer called character witnesses: two of Robert's hockey friends who barely knew Ethan, testifying about what a dedicated father Robert had been. A coach who described Ethan as "talented but distracted lately."

It felt performative. Hollow.

Finally, both sides rested.

"Closing statements," Judge Morrison said. "Mr. Price?"

Robert's lawyer stood. "Your Honor, this isn't about denying Ethan's autonomy. It's about protecting him from making a decision he'll regret. He's seventeen years old, in the middle of an intense relationship, abandoning a career he's worked toward his entire life. That's not mature decision-making—that's teenage impulsivity. If you grant this petition, you're telling every teenager in Manitoba that they can legally separate from their parents for a relationship. That's not what emancipation is for."

He sat down.

Michael stood. "Your Honor, emancipation exists for exactly this situation: a young person who is mature, financially stable, and psychologically harmed by continued parental control. Ethan Price isn't running away from responsibility. He's running toward a future he's earned the right to choose. He has MIT acceptance, scholarship funding, employment plans, and the emotional maturity to succeed independently. The only thing he's giving up is his father's control."

Michael looked at Robert. "Mr. Price loves his son. I don't doubt that. But love and control aren't the same thing. Granting this petition isn't about punishing a father. It's about freeing a son."

He sat down.

The courtroom was silent.

Judge Morrison looked at her notes. "I'll take a brief recess to consider the evidence."

She stood and left the courtroom.

---

Fifteen minutes felt like fifteen hours.

Sophia sat with her hands clasped, barely breathing. Maya was next to her, fidgeting. Mom had her arm around Sophia's shoulders. Dad was in the row behind them, silent.

Across the courtroom, Ethan sat perfectly still. Jordan was next to him, radiating nervous energy. Michael was reviewing notes, looking calm.

Caroline was crying silently, tissues balled up in her fists.

Robert was staring straight ahead, jaw clenched.

The courtroom door opened. Judge Morrison returned.

Everyone stood.

"Please be seated."

Sophia sat. Her heart was pounding so hard she could hear it.

"I've reviewed the petition, testimony, and evidence carefully," Judge Morrison began. Her voice was measured, giving nothing away. "This is not an easy decision. Emancipation is a serious legal action that fundamentally alters the parent-child relationship."

Sophia held her breath.

"Mr. Price," Judge Morrison said, looking at Robert, "I don't doubt that you love your son. The evidence shows substantial investment in his development, significant sacrifice, and genuine belief that hockey represents his best future. However."

She paused.

"Love and control are not synonymous. I'm troubled by the evidence of phone monitoring, application deletion, and the filing of criminal charges against Ms. Chen. These actions suggest a pattern of control that extends beyond reasonable parental guidance into manipulation."

Robert's face was stone.

"Ethan Price is seventeen years, nine months old. In less than three months, he will be a legal adult regardless of this ruling. The question before me is not whether he will eventually have autonomy, but whether requiring him to wait three more months serves any legitimate purpose."

Judge Morrison looked at Ethan.

"I find that it does not. Dr. Martinez's evaluation is compelling. Ethan demonstrates exceptional maturity, clear planning capabilities, and autonomous decision-making. His academic record predates the relationship in question, supporting his claim that MIT represents a longstanding interest rather than impulsive choice. He has concrete financial support through scholarship and employment. Most importantly, continued parental control appears to be causing psychological harm."

Sophia's hands tightened on the seat in front of her.

"Regarding the relationship with Ms. Chen, I find no evidence of manipulation or coercion. Their testimony showed mutual respect, shared goals, and age-appropriate partnership. The eleven-month age difference, while technically illegal in Manitoba, does not constitute the kind of predatory relationship these statutes were designed to prevent."

Judge Morrison looked down at her papers.

Then up at Ethan.

"This petition for emancipation is granted, effective immediately."

The courtroom erupted.

Sophia heard herself cry out—a sound of pure relief. Maya was screaming. Mom was sobbing. Dad was standing, hands pressed together in front of his mouth.

Across the courtroom, Ethan had his face in his hands. Jordan was hugging him. Michael was shaking his hand, smiling.

Caroline was crying harder, but smiling through the tears.

Robert stood abruptly. For a moment—one suspended, hopeful moment—Sophia thought he might speak. Might say something, anything, to his son.

But then he turned toward the door.

"Your Honor, I intend to appeal this decision—"

"Mr. Price, you may certainly appeal. But until and unless a higher court overturns this ruling, your son is legally emancipated. The restrictions of parental control no longer apply."

"You're making a mistake—"

"Mr. Price." Judge Morrison's voice was sharp. "This hearing is concluded. I suggest you take some time to process this decision before taking further action."

Robert stared at the judge, his face a mask of rage and grief and something that looked like defeat. Then he turned and strode toward the courtroom doors, his lawyers scrambling to follow.

He passed directly by Ethan's table.

"Dad—" Ethan's voice was small, broken.

Robert stopped.

For three heartbeats, he stood perfectly still. His back to his son. His hand on the door.

Ethan was half-standing, leaning forward like he might chase after him. His face was desperate, hopeful, terrified.

"Dad, please—"

Robert's shoulders tightened.

Then he pushed through the door and was gone.

The sound of the door closing echoed through the suddenly silent courtroom.

Ethan stood frozen, staring at the space where his father had been. His face was white, eyes wide with shock. He looked like he'd been struck.

Sophia watched him sway slightly, watched Jordan catch his elbow, watched Michael Chen say something she couldn't hear. But Ethan just kept staring at that door.

Waiting for it to open again.

It didn't.

Caroline made a sound—a sob or a gasp—and buried her face in her hands.

Judge Morrison banged her gavel once. "Court is adjourned."

But Sophia barely heard it. She was already moving, pushing past her family, crossing the courtroom to where Ethan stood.

The victory tasted like ash.

He'd won his freedom.

But his father had walked away without looking back.

---

Sophia didn't remember moving, but suddenly she was there, and Ethan turned to her like a drowning person reaching for air.

"He didn't—" Ethan's voice was hollow. "He just—"

"I know." She wrapped her arms around him, feeling him shake. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."

"I won." He said it like he couldn't quite believe it. Like the words didn't make sense. "I'm free. I'm actually free."

"You are."

"Then why does it—" His voice cracked. He pulled back to look at her, and his eyes were devastated. "Why does it feel like I just lost everything?"

Around them, people were celebrating. Maya was hugging their parents. Jordan was filming everything on his phone, narrating: "And that's how Ethan Price won his freedom." Michael was shaking hands with people. Caroline approached tentatively, and Ethan turned to her.

"Mom—"

"I'm so proud of you," Caroline said, pulling him into a fierce hug. "I'm so sorry. I should have done this sooner. I should have protected you—"

"You're here now," Ethan said into her shoulder. "That's what matters."

But Sophia could see the way his eyes kept drifting to the door. Looking for someone who wouldn't come back.

"Come on," Michael said eventually. "Let's get out of here. Media's going to want statements."

They filed out of the courtroom together—both families, mixed now, celebrating. The courthouse steps were packed with cameras and reporters and the same protesters who'd been there this morning, now looking uncertain about whether to keep chanting.

Michael gave a brief statement: "Today, Judge Morrison affirmed a young man's right to choose his own future. We're grateful for her wisdom and fairness."

Sophia's mom shielded her from the cameras. Maya told a reporter, "My sister is incredible and so is Ethan and you should write that."

Jordan was already posting to social media: "EMANCIPATION GRANTED. FREEDOM WON."

The media wanted more, but they pushed through to the cars.

Sophia ended up in the back seat of her parents' car with Maya and Ethan, all three of them squeezed together. Caroline was riding with Michael Chen and Jordan, following behind.

"You did it," Maya said, crying and laughing at the same time. "You stood up to everything and you won."

"We won," Ethan said quietly. But his voice was empty, and his hands were still shaking.

Sophia reached for one of those hands, lacing their fingers together. He gripped her hand like a lifeline.

"You both won," Mom said from the front seat, turning to look at them. "You fought for each other and you won."

But as the car pulled away from the courthouse, Sophia watched Ethan stare out the window at the building where he'd just legally severed the relationship with his father.

Free.

He was free.

But freedom, it turned out, came with a cost.

---

They ended up at The Forks—neutral territory with good food and big tables where both families could fit. The Italian restaurant had outdoor seating overlooking the rivers, and May sunshine, and the sound of people enjoying a Saturday afternoon.

It should have felt celebratory.

It felt complicated.

Ethan sat next to Sophia, holding her hand under the table, but he was quiet. Too quiet. His eyes kept going distant, like he was somewhere else entirely.

Caroline sat across from them, next to Maya and Mrs. Chen. She looked exhausted—the kind of tired that came from making impossible choices and living with the consequences.

"To freedom," Jordan said, raising his glass of water. "And to Ethan, who's officially the bravest person I know."

They all clinked glasses. Ethan managed a smile, but it didn't reach his eyes.

"How are you feeling?" Sophia's mom asked gently.

Ethan took a breath. "I don't—I don't know. It hasn't really hit me yet. That it's real."

"It's real," Michael said. "As of ten-thirty this morning, you're legally emancipated. You can make your own medical decisions, sign contracts, live wherever you choose. Your father no longer has legal authority over your life."

"He didn't even look at me," Ethan said suddenly. "When he left. He just—walked out. Like I didn't exist."

The table went silent.

Caroline's eyes filled with tears. "That's not—Ethan, that's not about you. That's about your father's inability to accept that he can't control this."

"But what if he's right?" Ethan's voice was small. "What if I am throwing everything away? What if MIT is a mistake and hockey was my future and I just—what if I'm wrong?"

Sophia squeezed his hand. "You're not wrong."

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do. Because you weren't happy playing hockey for someone else's dream. You're allowed to want something different."

"But what if I don't even know what I want?" Ethan looked at her, desperate. "What if I spent so long being what he wanted that I don't know who I am without that?"

Maya leaned forward. "Then you have the rest of your life to figure it out. That's what freedom means."

"It means you get to make mistakes," Jordan added. "And successes. And everything in between. On your own terms."

Ethan nodded, but Sophia could see the doubt still there. The fear that maybe Robert was right. That maybe he was giving up something irreplaceable.

The food came—pasta and salads and garlic bread—and they ate in fits and starts, conversation ebbing and flowing around the weight of what had just happened.

Sophia's dad asked Caroline about her plans. Where she was staying, whether she needed help finding an apartment. Caroline explained that her sister had helped her pack while Robert was at court, that she had a place to stay for now.

"I should have left years ago," Caroline said quietly. "I should have protected Ethan from—from all of this. But I was afraid. Of Robert, of being alone, of failing." She looked at Ethan. "I'm not afraid anymore."

Ethan reached across the table and took his mother's hand. "You're here now. That's what matters."

But Sophia saw the way he kept checking his phone. Looking for a message that wouldn't come. Hoping, despite everything, that his father would call.

After lunch, they walked along the river paths—the same paths where Ethan had told her back in September that they could be friends again, where they'd had their first real conversation in eight years. Where, just two weeks ago, they'd signed their MIT commitment letters sitting on a bench overlooking the water.

"This place keeps showing up," Ethan said, reading her thoughts. "Every time something important happens."

"Maybe that's good," Sophia said. "Having a place that's just ours."

He stopped walking, turning to face her. Behind him, the Red and Assiniboine Rivers met and merged, two paths becoming one.

"Thank you," he said. "For not giving up. For testifying. For—for being here."

"I'll always be here."

"What if—" He swallowed hard. "What if my dad never speaks to me again? What if he just—cuts me off completely?"

Sophia cupped his face in her hands. "Then you'll grieve that loss. And it will be awful. But you'll survive it. We'll survive it. Together."

"I don't know how to do this without him hating me."

"Maybe you can't. Maybe that's the price of choosing yourself."

Ethan closed his eyes, leaning into her touch. When he opened them again, they were wet with unshed tears.

"I won," he whispered. "So why do I feel like I lost?"

"Because love and control got tangled up for so long you can't separate them. But you will. Eventually."

He pulled her close, holding on like she was the only solid thing in a shifting world.

They stood like that for a long time, the rivers flowing around them, carrying away everything that couldn't be held onto.

Carrying them forward, whether they were ready or not.

By the time they got back to the cars, exhaustion had set in. The adrenaline of the morning had burned off, leaving everyone drained and quiet.

Sophia's parents offered to drive Ethan wherever he needed to go. Caroline was staying with her sister across town. Jordan had to get to work.

"I should—I should probably go to the apartment," Ethan said. "Start getting used to it being real."

The apartment Michael Chen had helped him find two weeks ago. The studio in Osborne Village with second-hand furniture and empty walls and the overwhelming reality of living alone at seventeen.

"Want company?" Sophia asked.

Ethan looked at her with such gratitude it made her chest ache. "Please."

They dropped Caroline off first—a quiet neighborhood in St. Vital, her sister's house with a garden and a welcome mat that said "Home." Caroline hugged Ethan for a long time before letting him go.

"Call me if you need anything," she said. "Anything at all. Day or night."

"I will, Mom."

Then they drove to Osborne Village, to the four-story building on Osborne Street where Ethan had signed a lease with Michael Chen's help. His first contract as an emancipated minor.

Sophia's parents said goodbye in the car, giving them space.

"We'll pick you up at six for dinner," Mom said. "Both of you. You shouldn't be alone tonight."

Ethan nodded gratefully.

Then it was just the two of them, climbing the stairs to the third floor, walking down the hallway to 3B.

Ethan unlocked the door with a key that still felt foreign in his hand.

The apartment was small—studio-sized, with a Murphy bed that folded down from the wall, a kitchenette in the corner, and one window overlooking the street. It was clean but sparse. A few boxes of belongings Caroline had packed for him. A lamp Jordan had contributed. Sheets Maya had bought as a housewarming gift.

It looked like a place someone was afraid to commit to.

"It's not much," Ethan said quietly.

"It's yours," Sophia said. "That's everything."

He walked to the window, staring out at Osborne Street below. Saturday shoppers, people walking dogs, normal life happening while his entire world had changed.

"Every time I bought something for this place," he said, "sheets, a lamp, groceries—part of me thought: what if Dad's right? What if I can't do this? What if I have to go back?"

Sophia came to stand beside him. "You don't have to go back. You won."

"Then why does it feel like I'm still waiting for permission?"

She understood what he meant. Freedom was one thing. Believing in it was another.

"Maybe it takes time," she said. "Maybe freedom is something you have to practice."

He turned to her, and for the first time all day, something like hope flickered in his eyes. "Will you help me? Practice being free?"

"Every day."

He kissed her forehead, soft and grateful. "I don't know what I'd do without you."

"You'll never have to find out."

They sat on the floor by the window, backs against the wall, shoulders touching. Outside, Winnipeg carried on—oblivious to the fact that one boy had just fought for and won the right to choose his own life.

Sophia felt the exhaustion settling into her bones. Six weeks of stress, one morning of terror and testimony, and now this strange, complicated victory.

Free.

They were both free.

The criminal charges were dropped. The emancipation was granted.

Nothing stood between them anymore.

Except the lingering ghost of Robert Price's expectations, and the question of what came next, and the uncomfortable truth that winning your freedom didn't automatically tell you what to do with it.

But for now, sitting on the floor of Ethan's tiny apartment, holding his hand while the afternoon light slanted through the window—this was enough.

They had time.

They had each other.

They had the freedom to figure out the rest.

Together.
