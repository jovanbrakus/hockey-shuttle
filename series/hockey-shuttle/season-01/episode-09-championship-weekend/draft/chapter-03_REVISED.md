# CHAPTER 3: FREE
## 11:30 AM - 6:00 PM

---

The courthouse steps were chaos.

Sophia stood blinking in the late-morning sunlight, still processing the judge's words. *Emancipation granted. Effective immediately.* Behind her, the heavy doors had barely closed before the media swarmed—cameras, microphones, reporters shouting questions over each other.

"Ethan! How does it feel to be free?"

"Sophia! Do you regret testifying?"

"Is this the end of your relationship with your parents?"

"What's next for you two?"

Ethan froze beside her, his hand still gripping hers from when they'd left the courtroom. She felt his fingers tighten, saw his face go blank—that shutdown expression he got when he was overwhelmed. After three hours of testimony, of laying his life bare in front of strangers, of watching his father walk out without a word, he had nothing left for a press conference.

"Inside," Maya said sharply, materializing at Sophia's other side. "Courthouse bathroom. Now."

Jordan Nakamura appeared next to Ethan. "I've got him. Follow me."

They moved as a unit, pushing back through the courthouse doors while Michael Chen stepped forward to handle the media. Sophia caught a glimpse of him raising his hands, heard him say something about prepared statements later, and then they were back in the cool, quiet interior.

Maya steered them down a side hallway, away from the main corridors. "Women's restroom, second floor. No cameras allowed in there. Go."

Sophia looked at Ethan. He was pale, breathing too fast, still holding her hand like a lifeline.

"Men's room is right across the hall," Jordan said gently. "You good, man?"

Ethan shook his head. "No. But I will be."

"Take five minutes," Maya said. "Breathe. Process. Then we'll figure out next steps."

Sophia squeezed Ethan's hand. "Meet you out here in five?"

He nodded, then surprised her by pulling her close, pressing his forehead against hers for just a moment. His eyes were closed. "We did it," he whispered.

"We did it," she confirmed.

Then Maya was pulling her toward the women's room and Jordan was guiding Ethan across the hall, and they were separated again. But this time it was temporary. This time, no court order said they couldn't be together.

This time, Ethan was free.

---

The bathroom was blessedly empty.

Sophia leaned against the sink, legs shaking. Maya locked the main door, then turned to her with an expression somewhere between triumph and fury.

"Your ex-boyfriend's father," Maya said slowly, "is a piece of work."

"He walked out."

"I saw. Before the judge even finished. Didn't look back once."

Sophia's chest ached. She'd watched it happen—the moment Judge Morrison said "emancipation granted," Robert Price had stood, grabbed his coat, and left. Just walked out of his son's life. Caroline had stayed, crying quietly in her seat, but Robert was done.

"Ethan must be devastated."

"Ethan's free." Maya's voice was firm. "And yeah, it hurts like hell, but he's FREE. Legally an adult at seventeen. No more control, no more manipulation, no more choosing between hockey and happiness." She stepped forward, pulling Sophia into a hug. "And you, my brilliant sister, have no criminal record. You're going to MIT clean. You won everything."

The tears came then, sudden and overwhelming. Sophia sobbed into Maya's shoulder while her sister held her, murmuring reassurances. All the fear from the past six weeks, all the terror from this morning, all the weight of watching Ethan testify about years of controlled isolation—it poured out in ugly, gasping sobs.

"I was so scared," Sophia managed.

"I know."

"What if the charges hadn't been dropped? What if the judge said no?"

"But she didn't. You won, Soph. You both won."

"His dad hates me."

"His dad hates everyone who isn't him. That's not about you."

Sophia pulled back, wiping her face. "Is it terrible that I want to kiss Ethan right now? We just got out of court, his family's imploding, everything's a mess, and all I can think about is how we haven't kissed since New Year's Eve and I really, really want to kiss him."

Maya laughed. "That's the least terrible thing I've heard all day. When this is over, when you're both ready, kiss him senseless. You've earned it."

"Four and a half months since we kissed."

"That's criminal. More criminal than anything Robert tried to charge you with."

Sophia laughed wetly. "You're ridiculous."

"I'm supportive." Maya handed her tissues. "Now fix your face. You look like you've been crying."

"I have been crying."

"Well, stop. We have a victory to celebrate."

---

When they emerged from the bathroom, Ethan and Jordan were waiting in the hallway. Ethan looked marginally better—less pale, breathing normal, though his eyes were red.

He saw Sophia and immediately crossed to her. No hesitation. Just walked right up and pulled her into his arms, holding her tight.

"Hi," she said against his chest.

"Hi." His voice was rough. "Sorry I lost it out there."

"You didn't lose anything. You stood in front of a judge and fought for yourself. That's not losing."

"My dad walked out."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"I'm not." He said it firmly, but she felt the tremor in his hands. "I mean, I am. But I'm not. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense."

They stood there, holding each other in the courthouse hallway while people passed by. A few looked at them curiously—they'd been all over the local news for weeks—but no one bothered them. It was just two teenagers hugging, both crying a little, both exhausted.

Finally, Jordan cleared his throat. "Uh, guys? Your parents are planning a celebration lunch. Both families. They're asking if you're up for it."

Ethan and Sophia pulled apart enough to look at each other.

"Both families?" Sophia asked carefully.

"Your parents, Maya, me, and Caroline," Jordan clarified. "Robert... left. Like, left-left. Drove away."

Ethan closed his eyes briefly. "Of course he did."

"Caroline wants to talk to you," Jordan continued gently. "She's waiting downstairs. She says it's okay if you're not ready, but she'd like to try to explain."

"Explain what? That she stood by while Dad tried to destroy my girlfriend? That she let him file criminal charges?"

"Ethan," Sophia said softly.

He shook his head. "Sorry. I know she's... she tried to stop him at the end. I know that. It's just—"

"A lot," Sophia finished. "It's a lot."

"Yeah."

Maya stepped forward. "How about this: we go get lunch. Neutral territory, somewhere with good food and private seating. Both families can celebrate the win. If Caroline wants to apologize, she can do it there. If it gets weird, we bail."

"What restaurant is going to give us private seating on a Saturday afternoon with no notice?" Ethan asked.

Jordan grinned. "Leave that to me. My parents own Giovanni's. I already called—private room is ready whenever we are."

Sophia looked at Ethan. "What do you think? Can you handle lunch right now?"

"I don't know. Can you?"

"I'm starving, actually. First time I've been hungry in weeks."

"Me too." Ethan managed a small smile. "Okay. Let's do it. But if it gets awkward—"

"We bail," everyone said in unison.

That got a real laugh from Ethan, and Sophia felt some of the tension ease from her shoulders. They were okay. Bruised and exhausted and emotionally wrung out, but okay.

And they had each other.

Finally. Legally. Completely.

---

Giovanni's was a small Italian restaurant tucked into a corner of Winnipeg's downtown, the kind of place with checkered tablecloths and photos of Italian grandmothers on the walls. Jordan's family had owned it for three generations, housed in a converted bank building on Portage Avenue—the original vault served as their wine cellar, which Jordan loved pointing out to first-time visitors.

Today, the private room in back held two families trying to celebrate a victory that felt more complicated than joyful.

Sophia sat between Ethan and Maya, acutely aware of the weird dynamics at the table. Her parents on one side—Mom still looked like she wanted to hug everyone and Dad kept checking his phone nervously. Jordan at the head, playing host. And across from them, Caroline Price.

Ethan's mother looked smaller than Sophia remembered. Older. She'd worn a navy suit to court, but she'd taken off the jacket and her blouse was wrinkled. Her eyes were red from crying, streaks of gray that seemed to have appeared overnight catching the overhead light. She kept looking at Ethan like she was afraid he'd disappear.

The waiter brought water and menus. Everyone ordered automatically—pasta, salads, whatever. Sophia barely registered what she chose. The silence was heavy.

Finally, Caroline spoke.

"Ethan, I—" Her voice cracked. She tried again. "I know I don't have the right to ask for anything. But if you could just... if you could give me a chance to—" She stopped, hands shaking. "I'm so sorry."

Ethan didn't look up from his water glass. "For which part?"

"All of it." Caroline's voice was barely above a whisper. "The restraining order. The charges. Standing by. Not fighting harder. Everything."

The waiter returned with breadsticks. Everyone ignored them.

"I left him," Caroline said abruptly. "Last night. While Robert was at his lawyer's office. My sister helped me pack. I'm staying with her until—until I figure out what's next."

Ethan's head snapped up. "You left Dad?"

"I should have left years ago. I just—I kept thinking I could fix it. Make things better. If I was just patient enough, understanding enough..." Caroline pressed her hands to her face. "But I was protecting him, not you. And by the time I realized that—" Her voice broke. "So much damage was done."

Sophia felt Ethan tense beside her. She reached under the table, found his hand, squeezed gently.

"Why now?" Ethan asked quietly. "What changed?"

"Watching you in court today. Seeing you stand there and testify about—about everything we did. Everything I let happen." Caroline lowered her hands. Tears streamed down her face. "My seventeen-year-old son had to sue for emancipation just to have basic autonomy. And I sat there thinking about the boy who used to bring me flowers from the neighbor's garden. Who'd wake up early to make me breakfast on Mother's Day. Who asked me to help him pick out his first suit for the science fair."

Ethan's grip on Sophia's hand tightened.

"I forgot that boy," Caroline whispered. "I let your father convince me that hockey was more important than who you were becoming. That control was the same as care. And I—" She couldn't continue.

Sophia's mother cleared her throat gently. "Caroline, I think I speak for all of us when I say... what you're doing takes courage."

"It took too long."

"But you're doing it now." Mom's voice was kind. "That matters."

Caroline looked at Sophia directly for the first time. "I owe you an apology too. A real one. What I did in your driveway—attacking you, trying to intimidate you—that was abuse. I'm an adult and you're eighteen and I used my age and my pain to hurt you. That's unforgivable."

Sophia didn't know what to say. The bruises from that encounter had faded weeks ago, but the memory was still sharp. This woman had filed criminal charges against her. Had stood by while Robert tried to destroy everything.

But looking at Caroline now, seeing the genuine devastation in her face, hearing the brokenness in her voice...

"I don't—" Sophia stopped, choosing her words carefully. "I can't say it's okay, because it's not. What you did hurt. But I understand being caught between loving someone and watching them make terrible choices."

Caroline nodded, wiping her eyes. "That's more grace than I deserve."

"Probably," Maya muttered. Sophia elbowed her.

"I'm filing for divorce," Caroline said, looking back at Ethan. "I called a lawyer this morning. I know that doesn't fix anything, but I wanted you to know. I'm choosing... I'm choosing to be someone better than who I've been."

Ethan stared at his mother for a long moment. His jaw worked like he was trying to find words. Finally, slowly, he reached across the table.

Caroline took his hand like a lifeline and sobbed.

"I'm still angry," Ethan said. His voice was shaking. "I'm angry about the charges, about the attack, about every time you chose Dad over me. That's not going to go away quickly."

"I know."

"But I don't—" He stopped, swallowed hard. "I don't want to lose you completely. You're my mom. I want to be able to have coffee sometimes. To tell you about MIT. To—to have a relationship where you see me, not Dad's hockey dreams."

"I want that too." Caroline was squeezing his hand with both of hers now. "I want to know who you really are. Not who we tried to make you. Just... you."

"I'm going to MIT in August."

"I know. I'm proud of you."

"I'm studying engineering. Not playing hockey."

"I know. I'm still proud."

"I'm in love with Sophia."

Caroline looked at Sophia, then back at Ethan. Her smile was watery but genuine. "I know. And she's brilliant and brave and clearly adores you. You chose well."

Ethan laughed wetly. "Yeah. I did."

Sophia was crying again. So was Maya. Sophia's parents were suspiciously shiny-eyed. Jordan was grinning like this was the best thing he'd ever witnessed.

The waiter returned with food. The mood shifted, lightened incrementally. Caroline asked tentative questions about MIT's housing, and Ethan explained the dorm situation with careful politeness. Sophia's mom asked about the engineering program. Jordan told an elaborate story about nearly getting arrested for skateboarding in the courthouse plaza that had everyone laughing despite themselves.

By the time dessert arrived—tiramisu that Jordan insisted was on the house—the table felt almost normal. Not comfortable, not easy, but... possible. Like maybe, eventually, with enough time and work, they could be families that shared meals instead of just survivors of a legal battlefield.

Sophia excused herself to the bathroom. She needed a minute to process, to let the emotional whiplash settle. In the hallway outside the restrooms, she ran into Caroline coming from the same direction.

They stopped, awkward.

"Sophia," Caroline said. "Can I—can we talk? Just for a minute?"

Sophia nodded, not trusting her voice.

Caroline took a shaky breath. "I want to say it again, just to you. What I did was unforgivable. I attacked you physically. I supported charges that could have destroyed your future. I tried to intimidate you into abandoning my son. That was wrong. All of it."

"Why?" Sophia asked. "Why did you do it? Really?"

"Because I was terrified." Caroline's voice was raw. "Terrified of losing Ethan. Terrified of admitting Robert was wrong. Terrified of facing what our marriage had become. You were—you were easier to blame than my husband. Easier to hate than myself."

"That's not fair."

"No, it's not." Caroline wiped her eyes. "Nothing about this has been fair. You want to know something terrible? Part of me is relieved the judge granted emancipation. Because now Ethan's free, and I don't have to keep choosing. The choice is made. I can finally admit Robert was wrong without it meaning I failed as a mother."

The honesty of it hit Sophia in the chest. "You didn't fail."

"I did. But maybe—" Caroline's voice broke. "Maybe I can do better going forward."

They stood there in the hallway, two people on opposite sides of so much pain, trying to find a path toward something that wasn't anger.

"I love him," Sophia said finally. "I'm going to keep loving him. And I'm going to MIT with him in August, and we're going to build a life together. I need you to be okay with that."

"I am. Truly." Caroline's smile was stronger now, almost reaching her eyes. "I want my son to be happy. And you—you make him happy. That's enough."

Sophia nodded. It wasn't forgiveness, not yet. But it was a start.

When they returned to the table, Ethan looked between them with obvious relief. Sophia slid back into her seat next to him and he immediately took her hand.

"Okay?" he murmured.

"Yeah. Okay."

---

By two o'clock, lunch was winding down. Sophia's parents were discussing logistics with Maya—something about picking up Sophia's things from the friend's house where she'd been staying during the legal proceedings. Caroline was on her phone, presumably dealing with divorce lawyers and moving plans. Jordan was settling the bill despite protests from all sides.

Ethan tugged Sophia's hand gently. "Can we—do you want to go somewhere? Just for a bit? I need to—I don't know. Process. Breathe."

"Yeah," Sophia said immediately. "Where?"

"The Forks?"

The suggestion made her heart clench. "You sure?"

"I think so. It feels—" He paused, searching for words. "It feels like the right place. Full circle, or something."

---

Twenty minutes later, they stood at The Forks, watching the Red and Assiniboine rivers meet.

It was warmer than their last visit—May sunshine instead of late winter chill. The market pavilions were busy with Saturday crowds, tourists and locals browsing stalls selling artisan crafts and local produce. The smell of fresh bread and coffee drifted from nearby vendors.

"Last time we were here," Sophia said softly, "was May first. Two weeks ago."

"MIT signing day." Ethan's hand found hers. "Sitting at that café table, filling out commitment forms, trying to believe we'd actually get to go together."

"You were so nervous your hand was shaking. You messed up your signature and had to do it over."

"Because Dad was texting me every five minutes. Demanding I reconsider. Telling me I was throwing my life away." Ethan's voice was quiet. "I kept thinking about the first time we came here. Episode two—early fall. You'd just moved back to Winnipeg, and everything was so new and terrifying."

Sophia remembered. "We sat on that bench"—she pointed—"and talked for three hours. About physics and hockey and what it felt like to be back in the same city after all those years apart."

"You told me about switching from hockey to badminton. How you weren't the best but you loved it anyway. How you didn't have to be the best at everything to matter." Ethan pulled her closer. "I'd never heard anyone say that before. My whole life was about being the best. And you just—you were brilliant and talented and happy without needing to be number one at everything."

"You were so surprised that I remembered you from hockey when we were little."

"I thought you wouldn't remember. We were nine." He laughed softly. "But you remembered everything. The blue parka. The granola bars. That time I fell and you helped me up."

They walked slowly along the riverwalk, neither in any hurry to be anywhere else.

"Two weeks ago," Sophia said, "we signed those papers and I thought—okay, this is it. We have a plan. MIT in August. Everything's going to be fine." She stopped, looking out at the water. "And then your dad filed criminal charges three days later, and everything exploded."

"But we still did it." Ethan turned her to face him. "We're still going to MIT. We still have the plan. We just—we fought for it harder than I ever imagined we'd have to."

Sophia looked up at him. At this boy who'd been her first friend, her first crush, her first love. Who'd stood in a courtroom this morning and fought for the right to choose his own future. Who'd lost his father in the process but gained his freedom.

"How does it feel?" she asked. "Being legally free?"

Ethan was quiet for a long moment. "Terrifying," he said finally. "Relieving. Sad. Like—like I should be celebrating, but part of me keeps waiting for Dad to call and tell me I'm making a mistake. That I'm ruining my life. That I'm choosing wrong."

As if on cue, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

Sophia felt him tense. Watched him pull it out, look at the screen, then let out a long breath.

"Jordan," he said. "Asking if we're okay."

"Not your dad."

"Not my dad." Ethan stared at his phone for another moment, then scrolled through his notifications. "Seventeen missed calls yesterday. Twenty-three texts. All from Dad." He looked up at her. "Nothing today. Since the judge granted emancipation, nothing."

"Do you think he'll reach out? Eventually?"

"I don't know." Ethan's voice was thick. "Part of me keeps thinking he'll realize he was wrong. That he'll apologize. That we can—I don't know. Have some kind of relationship. But the logical part of me knows he walked out of that courtroom without looking back. He's done."

Sophia pulled him into a hug, feeling his arms come around her immediately. They stood there on the riverwalk while tourists passed by and the May sunshine warmed their shoulders.

"I chose this," Ethan said into her hair. "I chose freedom over him. And it was the right choice. I know it was. But god, it hurts."

"I know, baby. I know."

They stayed there until Ethan's breathing evened out, until his grip loosened slightly, until he pulled back and managed a smile that was only a little broken.

"Thank you," he said. "For being here. For all of it."

"Always."

"I love you."

"I love you too." Sophia reached up, wiping tears from his cheeks. "Four and a half months since I could say that to your face without supervision."

"January first. New Year's kiss on Jordan's balcony."

"Best kiss of my life."

"Yeah?" His smile widened slightly. "Well, we've got time to top it now. No lawyers supervising. No court orders. No restrictions."

"Are you saying you want to kiss me, Ethan Price?"

"I'm saying I want to kiss you, Sophia Chen. But maybe—" He looked around at the crowded marketplace. "Maybe somewhere a bit more private than the most popular tourist destination in Winnipeg?"

She laughed, the sound lighter than it had been all day. "Good call."

"Besides," he said, pulling out his phone again, "I should probably check my apartment. Make sure I still have electricity and haven't been evicted for not paying rent or something."

"Very responsible."

"I'm legally an adult now. I have to be responsible." He said it with mock seriousness, then his expression turned more genuine. "Will you come with me? Help me make sure I haven't completely screwed up living on my own?"

"Absolutely."

---

Ethan's studio apartment was in a building near the university—small but clean, the kind of place a student could afford with scholarship money and a part-time job at a sporting goods store. He'd rented it three months ago in preparation for emancipation, but he'd barely spent time there. Most of his nights had been at friends' houses or, when things got really bad, sleeping in his car.

He unlocked the door and they stepped inside.

Sophia's first thought was how empty it looked. Not just sparse—empty. Like someone camping temporarily rather than living.

A mattress on the floor with a sleeping bag instead of sheets. A desk—just a folding table, really—with textbooks stacked in neat piles. A tiny kitchenette with exactly three dishes in the drying rack: one plate, one bowl, one cup. A bathroom barely big enough to turn around in.

No posters on the walls. No decorations. One lamp. One towel hanging in the bathroom.

"Home sweet home," Ethan said, but his voice was tight.

Sophia turned slowly, taking it in. This was freedom? This was what he'd fought for?

"Ethan," she said softly.

"I know it's not much. I've been meaning to—to get more stuff. Make it more—" He stopped, running his hand through his hair. "Every time I went shopping, I'd stand there in Target holding sheets or a poster or whatever, and I'd think: what if Dad's right? What if the judge says no? What if I'm wasting money on an apartment I'll never really live in?"

Sophia's heart broke.

"So I just—I got the minimum. Enough to survive. Not enough to make it real." He laughed, but it sounded hollow. "Pathetic, right? I fought for freedom and then I was too scared to actually live it."

"It's not pathetic." Sophia crossed to him, taking his hands. "It's human. You were protecting yourself. Hedging your bets."

"But the judge said yes. I'm free. And I still—" He looked around the bare apartment. "I still can't make myself believe it's real."

Sophia thought about her own room at home. The photos covering her walls. The badminton trophies on her bookshelf. The string lights Maya had helped her hang. The massive periodic table poster Ethan had given her for her birthday. All the accumulation of eighteen years of being loved and supported and allowed to be herself.

Ethan had a mattress and a sleeping bag.

"We're going shopping," she said.

"What?"

"Right now. We're going to Target and we're buying you sheets. Real sheets. And pillows. And posters. And whatever else you want. Because this is real. You're free. And you deserve to live in a place that feels like home."

"Sophia, you don't have to—"

"I want to." She squeezed his hands. "Besides, I'm investing in my future too. I plan on spending time here. I'm not making out with you on a mattress with just a sleeping bag. That's depressing."

That got a real laugh from him. "You're planning on making out with me?"

"I've been planning on making out with you since January first. I've just been legally prevented from doing so."

"Fair point." His expression softened. "You really want to help me shop for sheets?"

"I really want to help you build a home. Even if it's just for the summer before we leave for MIT."

Ethan pulled her close, pressing his forehead against hers. "What did I do to deserve you?"

"Shared your granola bars with me when we were nine. Clearly it's been paying dividends."

He kissed her forehead gently. Not a real kiss—they'd both agreed earlier that their first kiss in four and a half months deserved better than a courthouse hallway or a nearly-empty apartment. But it was sweet and tender and full of promise.

"Okay," he said. "Let's go make this place less depressing. But I'm paying."

"With what money? Your trust fund that your dad probably froze?"

"With my job money. I've been working weekends at SportChek for three months. I can afford sheets."

"Fine. But I'm helping pick them out."

"Deal."

---

Target on a Saturday afternoon was crowded and bright and overwhelmingly normal.

They wandered through the home goods section, Sophia pulling Ethan toward different displays while he looked bewildered by the sheer number of choices.

"How are there twenty different kinds of sheets?" he asked, staring at the bedding aisle. "They all do the same thing."

"Thread count," Sophia explained. "And material. These are cotton, these are microfiber, these are jersey knit—"

"You're speaking another language."

"Just—what color do you like?"

Ethan looked at the options. "Blue?"

"Blue sheets it is." Sophia grabbed a set. "Now pillows. You need at least two."

"Why do I need two? I'm one person."

"Because sometimes your girlfriend will want to sleep over and she needs her own pillow."

Ethan stopped mid-reach for a pillow, looking at her. "You want to sleep over?"

Sophia felt her cheeks warm. "I mean—not like, tonight. But eventually. When we're ready. We're both going to MIT in August. We should probably get comfortable with the idea of spending nights together."

"Comfortable with the idea." Ethan was smiling now, that soft smile that made her stomach flip. "Yeah. Okay. Two pillows."

They moved through the apartment section systematically. Towels—Ethan picked navy blue to match the sheets. A lamp that wasn't just functional but actually looked nice. Kitchen supplies: more dishes, real silverware, a coffee maker.

"Do you even drink coffee?" Sophia asked.

"No. But you do. And if you're going to spend time at my place, you should be able to make coffee."

Her heart swelled.

In the poster section, Ethan paused in front of a massive NASA print showing the solar system. His hand reached out, then hesitated.

"Get it," Sophia said.

"It's kind of expensive."

"Get it anyway. You're an engineering major. You love space. Your apartment should reflect who you are, not who your dad wanted you to be."

Ethan looked at the poster for another long moment, then grabbed it. "Okay. Yeah. I'm getting it."

They added string lights—Sophia's idea—and a cheap area rug to make the floor less institutional. A small bookshelf. A bulletin board for photos and notes.

By the time they checked out, they had two full carts and Ethan looked slightly panicked at the total, but he handed over his debit card without complaint.

"This is the most I've spent at once in my entire life," he said as they loaded bags into his car.

"You're building a home. It's worth it."

"Yeah." He looked at her over the top of the car. "It really is."

---

Back at the apartment, they spent the next hour transforming the space.

Ethan made the bed with the new sheets—navy blue cotton that actually fit the mattress properly—while Sophia hung the string lights around the perimeter of the room. The NASA poster went above the desk, secured with thumbtacks. The area rug made the floor feel immediately cozier.

They worked mostly in companionable silence, occasionally bumping into each other in the small space, laughing when they got tangled in the string lights.

When they were done, Ethan stood in the center of the room and looked around.

"It actually looks like someone lives here," he said quietly.

Sophia stepped up beside him. "It looks like YOU live here."

He turned to her, eyes bright. "Thank you. For this. For making it real."

"You made it real. You fought for it. I just helped pick out sheets."

"You helped pick out my freedom." He pulled her close. "Four and a half months ago, you kissed me at midnight on New Year's Eve and told me you loved me. And I thought—okay, this is it. This is what I'm fighting for. Not hockey. Not my dad's approval. Just this. Us."

Sophia's throat was tight. "Ethan—"

"I know we're waiting. For the right moment. For tonight." His arms tightened around her. "But I need you to know—you're what made all of this worth it. Every terrible moment. Every court hearing. Every night sleeping in my car or on Jordan's couch. It was worth it because it led to this. To us. Free."

She reached up, cupping his face. His skin was warm under her palms, his eyes locked on hers with an intensity that made her dizzy.

"Tonight," she whispered. "Jordan's party. When we're on the roof under the stars. That's when we'll—"

"Yeah." His voice was rough. "Tonight."

They stood there, foreheads pressed together, breathing the same air, the anticipation building between them like a living thing.

Finally, Sophia pulled back. "We should probably get ready. The party starts in an hour and I still need to shower and change."

"Right. Yeah." Ethan looked dazed. "Shower. Change. Party."

"You okay?"

"I'm great. I'm just—I've been waiting so long to kiss you again that I keep forgetting how to think about anything else."

Sophia laughed, feeling lighter than she had in months. "Same. But we've waited this long. We can wait a few more hours."

"A few more hours until I kiss you on a rooftop."

"Exactly."

"That's very romantic of you, Chen."

"I have my moments."

They gathered their things—Sophia needed to head home to get ready. At the door, Ethan caught her hand.

"Six PM?" he asked. "I'll pick you up?"

"It's a date."

"Our first real date. No supervision, no court orders, no countdown clock."

"Just us."

"Just us," he agreed.

She kissed his cheek—just a quick brush of her lips—and left before she could change her mind about waiting.

---

At home, Sophia stood in her shower and let the hot water wash away the stress of the day. Her muscles ached from tension, her eyes were puffy from crying, her head felt stuffed with cotton from emotional exhaustion.

But underneath it all was joy. Pure, effervescent, unstoppable joy.

They'd won. Both hearings. Ethan was free. She had no criminal record. They were going to MIT together in three months.

And tonight—tonight she was going to kiss him.

The thought made her stomach flip and her heart race. Four and a half months since New Year's Eve. Four and a half months of supervised phone calls and monitored texts and longing for something that seemed impossibly far away.

Tonight, it was finally happening.

She got out of the shower and surveyed her closet with new eyes. Not just picking an outfit for a party—picking an outfit for the night she'd been dreaming about since January.

The blue sundress. Definitely the blue sundress. The one Ethan had specifically requested when they texted earlier. It was casual but pretty, comfortable but flattering. Perfect for a party that would end with kissing on a rooftop.

She dried her hair carefully, adding loose curls that Maya had taught her how to do. Minimal makeup—just enough to cover the stress shadows under her eyes and add some color to her lips. The compass necklace Maya had given her that morning.

When she looked in the mirror, she saw herself: eighteen, in love, finally free to act on it.

Maya appeared in her doorway. "You look happy."

"I am happy." Sophia turned to her sister. "For the first time in so long, I'm just... happy."

"Good. You deserve it." Maya's smile turned mischievous. "So. Tonight's the night?"

Sophia felt her cheeks warm. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Please. You've been checking your phone every five minutes. You spent twenty minutes on your hair. You're wearing the dress he specifically requested." Maya crossed her arms. "You're going to kiss him tonight."

"Maybe."

"Definitely." Maya's expression softened. "Just—be safe, okay? I know you're both responsible, but—"

"We're just kissing, Maya."

"I know. I just—I worry. You've both been through so much. I want you to take care of each other."

Sophia crossed to her sister and hugged her tight. "We will. I promise."

"Good." Maya pulled back, blinking rapidly. "Okay. Enough sappiness. Go have the best night of your life. You've earned it."

At six o'clock exactly, Ethan knocked on her door.

He'd gone with the blue shirt and jeans, and Sophia had been right—it did match his eyes. He looked tired but lighter somehow, like a weight had lifted. His hair was slightly damp from his own shower, and he smelled like the cologne she'd given him for Christmas.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi yourself." She stepped out, closing the door behind her. "Ready to celebrate?"

"With you? Always."

He held out his hand. She took it.

And they walked to his car together, ready for whatever came next.
