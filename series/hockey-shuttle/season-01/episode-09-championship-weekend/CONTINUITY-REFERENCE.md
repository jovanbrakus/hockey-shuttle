## COMMON CONTINUITY PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ❌ PITFALL 1: Wrong Kiss Timeline
**WRONG**: "They hadn't kissed in weeks"
**RIGHT**: "They hadn't kissed since New Year's Eve, 4.5 months ago"
**Why**: Be specific about last kiss (Episode 4, January 1)

### ❌ PITFALL 2: Confusion About Ages
**WRONG**: "Both 18 now"
**RIGHT**: "Sophia 18, Ethan 17 (turns 18 August 12)"
**Why**: Age difference is 11 months and legally significant

### ❌ PITFALL 3: Recent Emancipation Petition
**WRONG**: "Filed last month"
**RIGHT**: "Filed February 20th, three months ago"
**Why**: This has been building since Episode 7

### ❌ PITFALL 4: Criminal Charges Are New
**WRONG**: "Charges filed this week"
**RIGHT**: "Charges filed May 1st, two weeks ago"
**Why**: Episode 8 cliffhanger was the charges reveal

### ❌ PITFALL 5: First Time Saying "I Love You"
**WRONG**: They say "I love you" for first time
**RIGHT**: They said it in Episode 5 motel, repeated it since
**Why**: "I love you" established in January

### ❌ PITFALL 6: Recent MIT Acceptance
**WRONG**: "Just got into MIT"
**RIGHT**: "Accepted mid-March, signed May 1st"
**Why**: College decision day was Episode 8

### ❌ PITFALL 7: Becca Storyline Active
**WRONG**: Becca upset about them
**RIGHT**: Becca moved on 7 months ago
**Why**: Episode 2 breakup, Episode 3 new boyfriend

### ❌ PITFALL 8: They've Been Apart Since Episode 5
**WRONG**: "Haven't seen each other since January"
**RIGHT**: "Spring break supervised visits March 25-29"
**Why**: Episode 7 established limited contact approval

### ❌ PITFALL 9: Robert as Cartoon Villain
**WRONG**: Robert being cruel for cruelty's sake
**RIGHT**: Robert desperate, believes he's protecting Ethan, 13 years invested
**Why**: He's antagonist but not monster - complex character

### ❌ PITFALL 10: Caroline Absent
**WRONG**: Caroline not mentioned
**RIGHT**: Caroline separating from Robert, supporting Ethan
