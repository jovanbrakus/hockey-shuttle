## The Cliffhanger (Pages 77-80)

### Page 77: The Descent

They came down from the roof holding hands, giddy and reckless in a way neither of them had ever been. Ethan's lips still tingled. His phone buzzed in his pocket—had been buzzing for the last twenty minutes while they'd been lost in each other.

"Popular tonight," Sophia teased, squeezing his fingers.

He pulled out his phone. Seventeen missed texts, mostly from teammates celebrating. Three from Jordan: *WHERE ARE YOU*, *SERIOUSLY WHERE*, *oh wait i see you on the roof you're WELCOME*.

And one notification from five minutes ago: Unknown Number - Voicemail.

"Probably a reporter," Ethan said, pocketing the phone. "They've been calling all day about the—"

It rang again. Same unknown number.

Something in his chest tightened. At 11:30 PM, reporters didn't call. His thumb hovered over the decline button.

"You should answer," Sophia said. "Might be important."

He almost said it could wait—that tonight was theirs, that nothing else mattered. But her eyes were curious, and something about the persistence made him slide to accept.

"Hello?"

"Ethan Blake?" A man's voice, older, confident. "This is Tom Williams, head coach of the Detroit Red Wings."

Ethan stopped walking. Sophia's hand slipped from his, her eyebrows raising in question. He mouthed: *Red Wings*.

"Coach Williams," he managed. "I... this is unexpected."

"I imagine it is. Especially tonight." There was warmth in the coach's voice, something almost paternal. "I understand your situation changed today. Congratulations on your emancipation. That couldn't have been easy."

The words hit like a physical thing. How did he already know? The ruling was barely twelve hours old.

"Thank you, sir."

"I also understand you signed your commitment to MIT. Educational deferment through the NCAA, studying instead of taking the NHL draft route." A pause. "That takes courage, son. Real courage."

Ethan's heart hammered. He looked at Sophia, saw her watching his face, reading every micro-expression. "MIT was the right choice for me, Coach."

"I'm not calling to argue with that choice, Ethan. I'm calling to offer you another one."

### Page 78: The Offer

Ethan leaned against the hallway wall, suddenly needing support. Through Jordan's apartment door, music thumped, people laughed. Sophia moved closer, tilting her head to hear.

"I'm listening," he said carefully.

"The Red Wings want to offer you a full NHL contract. Signing bonus of two and a half million dollars, base salary of three point two million per year. Standard entry-level structure, three years guaranteed."

The numbers didn't feel real. Ethan had heard them before—his father had thrown similar figures around since he was fourteen. But hearing them from an actual NHL coach, officially, made his knees weak.

"Coach, I appreciate the offer, but I've already—"

"Let me finish." Williams's voice was kind but firm. "I know you chose MIT. I know you and your father... well, I know the situation. But here's what I don't think you know: MIT has a partnership program with professional athletes. We've done this before with academically gifted players. Not often, but it exists."

Ethan's breath caught. Sophia grabbed his arm, her fingers digging in.

"What kind of program?"

"Modified enrollment. You'd play hockey from October through April—full NHL season. Then you'd attend MIT from May through August, taking an intensive course load. It's harder than traditional enrollment, no question. But you'd graduate in five years with your engineering degree while playing professional hockey."

The world tilted. Ethan closed his eyes, but that made it worse. "That's... that's possible?"

"MIT Athletics already approved your file. They do it for Olympic athletes, international competitors. Your academic record is exceptional enough that they're willing to work with your schedule. You'd attend summer sessions, some online coursework during season, but you'd get the full MIT education."

"And the degree would be—"

"Identical to every other MIT engineering graduate. You'd walk across that stage in five years with the same diploma, same credentials, same opportunities."

Sophia's hand had moved to cover her mouth. She'd heard every word.

"You don't have to choose, Ethan," Coach Williams said quietly. "That's what I called to tell you. You can have both. Professional hockey career, financial security, AND your MIT degree. You can have the future you want and the one your talent deserves."

Ethan's throat closed. The hallway spun.

"I need to think about this," he whispered.

"Of course. Talk it over with the people who matter to you. Talk to MIT—they'll confirm everything I've said. But Ethan?" Williams paused. "You've got two weeks. I need an answer by June first. If you say yes, we'll have contracts ready by graduation day."

"June first," Ethan repeated numbly.

"Congratulations again on today, son. You're free to make your own choices now. Make sure this one is really yours."

The line went dead.

### Page 79: The Silence

Ethan stood frozen, phone still pressed to his ear, staring at nothing. Music pulsed through Jordan's door. Someone laughed. The world was exactly the same as it had been five minutes ago, except everything was different.

"Ethan?" Sophia's voice was small.

He lowered the phone slowly, looked at her. Her face was pale, eyes huge and dark and full of something he couldn't name. Fear? Hope? Both?

"Did you hear all that?" he asked.

"Most of it." She wrapped her arms around herself. "A third option?"

"Yeah." He laughed, but it sounded broken. "Turns out I didn't have to choose after all."

They stared at each other. Two weeks ago, they'd been drowning—his father's control, the NHL pressure, the impossible choice between dreams. One week ago, they'd filed for emancipation, committed to MIT together, chosen education over money. Today, they'd won their freedom. Tonight, they'd kissed on a roof under the stars, finally admitting what they'd been dancing around for months.

And now.

"MIT and NHL," Sophia said quietly. "Both."

"Five years instead of four. Summers in Cambridge, winters in Detroit. But both." His voice cracked. "Everything I gave up... I could have had it anyway."

She flinched like he'd hit her. "You didn't give it up. You chose—"

"I know." He reached for her hand, desperate to make her understand. "I know I chose. We chose. But Sophia, what if..." He couldn't finish.

"What if you didn't have to," she completed.

The words hung between them like smoke.

### Page 80: The Question

Sophia's mind raced, trying to process, trying to feel something other than the sick twist in her stomach.

They'd fought so hard. The meetings with lawyers, the court hearing, facing his parents in that sterile room. She'd watched him sign away his relationship with his father, watched him choose a future that meant less money, less glory, less of everything the hockey world had promised him.

And she'd been so sure—they'd both been so sure—that it was the right choice. MIT together. Research and classes and late nights in the library. Building something real instead of chasing something borrowed.

But what if there had been a third option all along? What if they'd fought the wrong battle?

"We chose each other," she said, voice shaking. "We chose MIT. We chose freedom."

"I know." Ethan's thumb traced circles on her palm, automatic and desperate.

"But what if—" She couldn't say it. Couldn't voice the terrible thought blooming in her chest: *What if we could have had all of it without the pain?*

Ethan's eyes were haunted. He'd heard the unspoken words anyway.

"What do we do now?" she whispered.

He looked at her—really looked at her—and she saw everything in his face. The boy who'd shared his granola bars in junior kindergarten. The kid who'd raced her across frozen ponds. The teenager who'd shown up in her city and pulled her back into his orbit like gravity. The almost-man who'd kissed her an hour ago like she was oxygen.

And underneath all of that: uncertainty.

For months, their path had been clear. Difficult, yes. Painful, absolutely. But clear. MIT or NHL. Education or money. Each other or his parents' dreams.

Now the path forked into territories they'd never mapped. Detroit winters and Cambridge summers. Professional athlete and MIT student. Everything they'd wanted, but divided, separated, split between two impossible lives.

"I don't know," Ethan said finally.

And Sophia realized with crystal-sharp clarity: neither did she.

They stood in Jordan's hallway while the party raged behind closed doors, holding hands like lifelines, both wondering the same thing:

Had they chosen right? Or had they just chosen too soon?

Ethan's phone buzzed again. Another unknown number.

He didn't answer.
