# THE KISS SCENE
## Jordan's Roof - May 15th, 9:30 PM

---

Jordan caught my eye from across the living room, where Ethan was being interrogated by Marcus about next week's finals schedule. She tilted her head toward the hallway that led to her art studio, then toward the ceiling. Her expression was knowing, gentle.

*Go. You've earned this.*

I mouthed "thank you" and slipped through the crowd. The party noise—laughter, music, overlapping conversations about court and summer plans—faded as I climbed the studio stairs. The space smelled like paint and turpentine, familiar and safe. The skylight was propped open, ladder extended to the roof access.

My legs were shaking. From exhaustion, maybe. From anticipation, definitely.

I climbed.

The roof was flat, tar paper and gravel, with a low wall around the edges. The sky was that particular Winnipeg spring color—not quite dark yet at 9:30, but getting there, deep blue bleeding into purple. Stars were starting to appear. The city spread out below us, lights flickering on in windows and streetlamps.

The air was cool but not cold. Perfect.

I heard him climbing behind me, his footsteps sure and steady on the ladder. Then he was beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched, and we were alone.

Actually alone. No supervision. No rules. No threats hanging over our heads.

Free.

"Hi," he said softly.

"Hi yourself." I leaned against him, and he wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pulling me closer. We stood like that for a moment, just breathing, just being.

"How are you still standing?" I asked. "We've been awake since five."

"Adrenaline. Also I think I'm too tired to sleep." His voice was rough, worn down by the long day. "You?"

"Same. My brain won't shut off." I tilted my head back to look at the stars. More appearing every minute. "We really did it."

"We really did." His arm tightened. "Judge Morrison, unanimous jury verdict, everything."

"Your parents have no legal claim on you."

"Kyle's going to prison."

"You're staying in Winnipeg."

"We're going to MIT together." His voice cracked slightly on those words. "Soph. We're *going to MIT together*."

I turned to face him properly, and something in my chest cracked open—all the fear and tension and barely-held-together determination from the past four months. He was looking at me the way he'd been looking at me since January, since before January, since we were nine years old probably. Like I was the answer to every question he'd ever asked.

"We survived," I whispered.

"Yeah." He reached up, tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, his fingers lingering against my cheek. "We did."

"Your parents, the custody fight, criminal charges, long distance, all of it."

"Six years apart before that."

"Eleven years of wanting this."

His thumb traced my cheekbone. "Every single day of those eleven years."

The sunset light caught in his eyes—brown and gold and impossibly warm. I'd memorized every fleck, every shade, but somehow they were still surprising me. Still making my heart skip beats like a poorly calibrated metronome.

"What happens now?" I asked. Not scared, just... wondering. We'd been in survival mode so long.

"Now?" He smiled, slow and real. "Now we get to just... be together. No countdown. No checking over our shoulders. Just us."

"Just us," I repeated. Testing the words. They felt too good to be true.

"Tell me about MIT," he said. "What are you most excited about?"

I let myself lean into the question, into the future we'd finally earned. "The labs. Professor Yang's quantum computing research. The fact that we can get coffee at 2 AM when we're cramming for exams." I paused. "Walking across campus holding your hand."

His smile widened. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." I reached for his hand, laced our fingers together. "Public hand-holding. Revolutionary concept."

"We could do more than hold hands, you know." His voice dropped lower. "We're not breaking any rules anymore."

My pulse jumped. "Radical idea."

"Pretty sure Jordan gave us this roof for a reason." He was closer now, or maybe I was, gravity pulling us together like we'd been orbiting for years and finally hit critical proximity.

"Smart friend."

"The smartest." His free hand came up to cup my face. "Sophia."

"Yeah?"

"I love you." The words were simple, but his voice carried everything—eleven years of history, four months of hell, every scared moment and brave choice and desperate hope. "I have loved you since I was nine years old. I loved you when we were apart. I loved you every day we couldn't be together. I loved you through everything, and I'm going to love you for everything that comes next."

My eyes were burning. "Ethan."

"I'm not finished." His thumb brushed across my cheek, catching a tear I hadn't realized had fallen. "You are the bravest, smartest, most stubborn person I've ever met. You flew across the country to testify for me. You stood up to my parents. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. You're my best friend and you always have been and I—" His voice cracked. "I never stopped loving you. Not for one single day."

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Every analytical bone in my body had dissolved.

"I love you," I managed. "I love you so much it doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to fall in love gradually, logically, but I think I loved you before I knew what the word meant. Every science competition, every hockey practice, every time you smiled at me like I was the only person in the world who mattered—"

"You were. You are."

"—I've been in love with you my entire life." The words were tumbling out now, unstoppable. "When you left, I thought I'd lost my chance. When we found each other again, I thought it was impossible. When your parents tried to take you away, I thought I'd break. But here we are. We're here, and we're free, and I love you. I love you."

"Sophia." His forehead touched mine. We were breathing the same air. "Can I kiss you?"

"Please."

The first touch of his lips was gentle—questioning, careful, like I might disappear. I pressed closer, answering, telling him without words that I was real, we were real, this was finally, actually happening.

He made a soft sound and deepened the kiss, his hand sliding into my hair, and oh—*oh*. This was different than the New Year's kiss, that stolen moment in public, quick and desperate and interrupted. This was private. Ours. No one watching, no one interrupting, nothing but us and the darkening sky and the rest of our lives spreading out ahead.

I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer, and he responded by banding his arm around my waist, holding me like I was precious, like I was everything. His lips were soft and warm and tasted slightly like the punch someone had spiked downstairs. His hand in my hair sent shivers down my spine. My heart was racing so fast I could hear it, feel it, every beat saying *yes yes yes finally yes*.

We broke apart for air, and he laughed—pure joy, unfiltered—and then we were kissing again. Slower this time, learning each other. The angle of his jaw under my palm. The way his breath hitched when I kissed the corner of his mouth. The solid warmth of him against me, real and here and mine.

"Sophia," he breathed against my lips.

"Don't stop."

"Never." He kissed me again, and again, and I stopped counting. Stopped thinking. Just felt—the rough texture of his hoodie under my hands, the gentle pressure of his fingers tracing patterns on my back, the taste of him, the smell of his soap, the sound of his breathing mixing with mine.

Above us, stars were appearing in earnest now, the sky fully dark. Below, the city lights twinkled, distant and separate from our world. The roof, this moment, belonged only to us.

"I love you," I said again, between kisses. Couldn't stop saying it. Eleven years of holding back.

"I love you." Kiss. "I love you." Another kiss. "Never letting you go."

"Good." I pulled back just enough to look at him—his eyes dark and bright, his smile soft and real, his expression completely open. Vulnerable and trusting and *happy*. "Because you're stuck with me now. You know that, right?"

"Best fate I can imagine." He tucked my hair back, his touch reverent. "You and me. MIT. Whatever comes after."

"Everything that comes after."

"Everything," he agreed.

We kissed again, softer now, gentler. Not desperate or rushed. We had time. We had the whole summer. We had MIT. We had years ahead of us, no more countdowns or deadlines or threats.

We had each other, finally, completely, freely.

I could feel him smiling against my lips. Started smiling too. The kiss dissolved into laughter—breathless, joyful, probably slightly unhinged from exhaustion and relief and too many emotions to process.

"We're really doing this," I said.

"We really are." He rested his forehead against mine again. "No more hiding. No more rules. Just us."

"Just us," I echoed.

We stayed like that for a while—minutes or hours, time had stopped meaning anything—holding each other, trading kisses, watching stars appear. His fingers traced patterns on my spine. My hand found its way to his hair, running through the soft strands. Every touch felt significant, precious. We'd fought so hard for this.

"We should probably go back down eventually," he murmured, though he made no move to let go. "People will notice we're gone."

"Let them notice." I kissed him again. "Jordan gave us this roof. I'm using it."

He laughed against my lips. "No arguments here."

But eventually—reluctantly—we did pull apart. The party sounds drifted up from below, reminding us of the real world. Friends who loved us. Family we'd chosen. A future we'd earned.

"One more kiss," he said.

"One more."

It wasn't just one. It was three, then four, then I lost count again. But finally, we made it to the ladder. He climbed down first, then helped me down, his hands on my waist as I descended.

On the studio floor, he pulled me close again, kissed my forehead, my nose, my lips once more.

"Ready?" he asked.

I laced my fingers with his. "With you? Always."

We walked back to the party together, hand in hand, and everything was different. The same people, the same room, but we'd crossed some invisible threshold. Changed in ways that would keep unfolding.

Jordan caught my eye when we emerged, and her smile was knowing and warm. Marcus wolf-whistled until Emma elbowed him. My dad raised his beer in a subtle toast.

But I barely noticed any of it. Because Ethan's hand was in mine, solid and real and public. Because we could stand together without counting minutes or checking phones or worrying about who was watching.

Because we were free.

And we were together.

Finally, actually, completely together.

*Everything else could wait.*
