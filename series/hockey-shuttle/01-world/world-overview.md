# Hockey Shuttle - World Overview

## The Two Cities

### Millbrook, Ontario (Past - Age 9)
**Population**: 8,500
**Character**: Small Canadian town 2 hours north of Toronto, where everyone knows everyone. The kind of place where hockey isn't just a sport—it's a religion. One Tim Hortons, one arena, three stoplights.

### Winnipeg, Manitoba (Present - Age 16-17)
**Population**: 750,000
**Character**: "The Heart of the Continent" - A prairie city where winter defines character and hockey shapes culture. Big enough for opportunity, small enough that the elite athletic community is tight-knit. Known for:
- Brutal winters that forge tough athletes
- Strong hockey culture (Jets NHL team)
- Surprising badminton community (large Asian population)
- Academic excellence (proximity to University of Manitoba)
- "Winnipeg Handshake" - locals' dark humor about the cold

## Why Winnipeg Works
- **Hockey Heritage**: Multiple AAA programs, direct NHL pipeline
- **Winter Culture**: Indoor sports thrive during 6-month winters
- **Diverse Demographics**: Strong Asian community supports competitive badminton
- **Academic Opportunities**: Top science programs, research facilities
- **Geographic Isolation**: Creates intensity in local social scenes
- **Class Dynamics**: Clear wealthy neighborhoods (boy's family) vs middle-class areas (girl's family)
