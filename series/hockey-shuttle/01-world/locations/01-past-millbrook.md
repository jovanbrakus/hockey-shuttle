# PAST LOCATIONS - Millbrook, Ontario

## 1. Millbrook Community Arena
**"The Barn"**

### Physical Description
A single-pad arena built in 1982, with faded blue metal siding and a roof that leaks when it rains. The wooden boards are covered in decades of scratches and sponsor banners for local businesses that no longer exist. Penalty boxes smell like sweat-soaked equipment and orange slices.

### Sensory Details
- **Sight**: Fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows on ice, parents bundled in winter coats in barely-heated stands, breath visible even inside
- **Sound**: Skate blades carving ice, pucks hitting boards with hollow thunks, echoing voices in empty space, ancient Zamboni groaning
- **Smell**: Ice (sharp, clean), wet wool, Tim Hortons coffee from the lobby, hockey bag funk
- **Touch**: Biting cold from the ice surface, smooth dasher boards worn by thousands of small hands, rough wooden bench seats
- **Atmosphere**: Communal, everyone-knows-everyone energy. Parents volunteer for everything. Kids share equipment.

### Story Function
- **Flashbacks**: Where they first skated together, fell together, helped each other up
- **Emotional Core**: Represents innocence before ambition separated them
- **Contrast**: Shows how far he's come (AAA facilities vs The Barn)
- **Key Memory**: The day his parents announced the move while he sat in full gear, not understanding yet what he'd lose

### Specific Scenes
- **Age 5-6**: Parent-and-tot hockey, both wobbling on tiny skates
- **Age 7-8**: First real practices, her keeping up with the boys
- **Age 9**: His last practice before moving, both pretending it's fine
