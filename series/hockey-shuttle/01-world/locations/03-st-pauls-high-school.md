  - Loners who pair up
  - Study-lunch people
  - Where she initially sits

- **Stand and eat by microwaves**: Lowest status or too cool to care
  - Gamers on phones
  - Kids who don't fit
  - Or intentionally rejecting system

- Finding spot at edge of study kids' table

**Their Dynamic**:
- He can't invite her to his table (girlfriend, image)
- She won't sit near his table (won't give satisfaction)
- They catch eyes across room
- Sometimes he gets up to "get something" and pauses by her table
- After they're friends: negotiating his two worlds

#### The Library
**"Their Place"**

**Physical Space**:

- Curve-killing reputation matters
- Teacher recommendations high stakes

### Social Hierarchy

**Top Tier**:
