4. School hallways (witnessed)

**Semi-Public** (present but less watched):
5. The Forks (crowds provide anonymity)
6. School library (acceptable interaction)

8. Assiniboine Park (spread out)

**Semi-Private** (some privacy, some risk):

By Episode 10, the map of Winnipeg is the map of their relationship. Every location holds memory. Every drive another conversation. Every space categorized: safe or dangerous, theirs or others', authentic or performed.

The kiss happens in the sculpture garden because:
- It's public (no more hiding)
- It's beautiful (love deserves beauty)
- It's art (what they've created together)
- It's spring (new beginning after winter)
- It's their choice (not forced by weather or chance)
- It's where he found her once (Episode 6 callback)
- It's where they find each other fully (Episode 10 resolution)

The geography complete. The world built. The stage set for their story to unfold across Winnipeg's streets, seasons, and spaces—from Millbrook's simple past to their complicated present to their chosen future.
