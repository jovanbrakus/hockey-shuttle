# Hockey Shuttle - World Building Summary

## Overview
A vivid, authentic world spanning two Canadian cities across seven years, grounding a YA romance in the specific realities of hockey culture, class differences, and Winnipeg winters.

---

## The Two Cities

### Millbrook, Ontario (Past, Age 9)
**Character**: Small-town innocence, community hockey, equal footing
- Population 8,500
- One arena, one school, one Tim Hortons
- Where they were just kids who played hockey and competed in math
- Represents what they lost when ambition separated them
- Flashback location showing their foundation

### Winnipeg, Manitoba (Present, Age 16-17)
**Character**: Prairie city where winter shapes everything, hockey is religion, class divides are visible
- Population 750,000
- Geographic center of North America
- Extreme weather (−40°C winter, +35°C summer)
- Strong hockey culture (NHL Jets, multiple AAA programs)
- Surprising badminton community (large Asian population)
- Academic excellence (University of Manitoba connection)
- Big enough for opportunity, small enough for tight elite circles

**Why Winnipeg Works**:
- Supports both elite hockey AND competitive badminton
- Winter creates pressure-cooker intimacy (everyone inside)
- Class visible but not extreme (Canadian, not NYC/LA)
- Geographic isolation increases stakes (can't escape easily)
- Six-month winter structures story seasons
- Real city with specific character (not generic)

## Thematic Geography

### Class and Access
**Visible Through**:
- Neighborhoods (River Heights vs Fort Garry)
- Facilities (Bell MTS Iceplex vs Badminton Manitoba)
- Schools (Private tuition, scholarship stigma)
- Vehicles (Gift truck vs shared family car)
- Homes (Size, maintenance, pressure vs warmth)

**Function**: Not about money alone—about access, opportunities, different pressures

### Performance vs Authenticity
**Performance Spaces**:
- School cafeteria (social hierarchy on display)
- Hockey games (scouts watching)
- His home (parental expectations)
- Osborne Village (scene-y, image matters)

**Authentic Spaces**:
- His truck alone together (honest possible)
- Bookstore upper level (hidden, real)
- Her home (accepted as-is)
- Late night calls (voice in darkness = truth)

**Function**: Where you are determines who you can be

### Isolation vs Connection
**Isolating Despite Crowds**:
- His home (loved but lonely)
- Hockey facility (surrounded but alone)
- Top of social hierarchy (visible but unseen)

**Connecting Despite Distance**:
- Her home (family warmth)
- Their chosen spaces (Forks, bookstore, park)
- Any space when together (connection portable)

**Function**: Loneliness isn't about being alone; connection isn't about proximity

### Winter as Metaphor
**Literal Winter**:
- Cold, dark, harsh, requiring endurance
- Forces indoor life, creates privacy needs
- Car conversations necessity
- Survival bonding

**Metaphorical Winter**:
- His life under pressure
- Their feelings frozen (can't act on)
- Waiting for spring (when truth can emerge)
- Beauty in harshness (their connection despite obstacles)

**Spring Thaw**:
- Revealing what winter hid
- Growth after dormancy
- Rebirth and transformation
- Chosen future over expected path

## Location Hierarchy

### Most Safe for Them (Privacy, Authenticity)
1. His truck (dark, mobile, alone)
2. Bookstore upper level (hidden, legitimate excuse)
3. Her home (family accepting)
4. Starbucks parking lot (anonymous, generic)
5. Park trails when empty (space, movement)

### Neutral Territory (Public Privacy)
1. The Forks (crowds provide anonymity)
2. School library (academic excuse acceptable)
3. Generic coffee shops (forgettable)
4. Public spaces in winter (everyone bundled, anonymous)

### Dangerous Territory (Visibility, Consequences)
1. School cafeteria (social theater, girlfriend present)
2. His hockey facility (his world, she doesn't fit)
3. Osborne Village (girlfriend's domain, friends watching)
4. Any teammate hangout (masculine performance, questions)
5. Social media check-ins (digital witnesses)

## Movement Patterns

### His Daily Orbit (Exhausting)
- Home (River Heights) → School → Iceplex (2-3 hours) → Teammates/Girlfriend → Home
- Time: 7 AM to 10 PM
- Miles: 40+ per day
- Feeling: Controlled, scheduled, performing

### Her Daily Orbit (Balanced)
- Home (Fort Garry) → School → Library/Home → Badminton (alternate days) → Home
- Time: 7:30 AM to 9 PM
- Miles: 25 per day
- Feeling: Busy but manageable, authentic

### Their Intersection
- **Forced**: School (daily, unavoidable, witnesses)
- **Convenient**: Starbucks, coffee shops (between locations)
- **Chosen**: Bookstore, Forks, park (intentional meetings)
- **Created**: "Wrong turn" drives, "one more song" parking lot conversations

### The Long Way Home
**Direct Route**: 15 minutes school to her house
**Their Route**: 45-60 minutes (coffee stop, scenic route, "missed turn," parked outside talking)
**Function**: Creating time when none should exist

## Why This World Works

### Authenticity
- Real city with specific character (not generic "city")
- Actual facilities and businesses (Bell MTS Iceplex exists)
- True weather patterns (Winnipeg winter is this brutal)
- Accurate cultural details (Winnipeg Handshake, Festival du Voyageur)
- Real teen spaces (St. Paul's type schools exist)

### Specificity
- Named neighborhoods with distinct characters
- Travel times accurate
- Class markers visible but not cartoonish
- Sports cultures both represented (hockey AND badminton)
- Academic opportunities realistic

### Functionality
- Weather affects plot (forces proximity, creates obstacles)
- Geography creates conflict (time between locations)
- Seasons structure emotional arc (fall to spring)
- Spaces enable different kinds of scenes
- Every location serves story purpose

### Symbolism
- Winnipeg isolation = their emotional isolation
- Winter pressure = his life pressure
- Spring thaw = emotional revelation
- Class geography = different life pressures
- Public/private spaces = performed vs authentic selves

### Immersion
- Multi-sensory descriptions for every space
- Specific details (what's visible, audible, tangible)
- Emotional atmosphere clear
- Weather as felt experience
- Spaces readers can picture and inhabit

## For Writers Using This World

### When Writing Scenes, Consider:

**Location Choice**:
- What does this space allow/prevent?
- Who might witness them here?
- What's the temperature, season, time of day?
- Is this his world, hers, or neutral?
- Can they be honest here, or must they perform?

**Sensory Details**:
- What do they smell upon entering?
- What's the ambient sound?
- What's the temperature/touch experience?
- What's the emotional atmosphere?
- How does weather affect the scene?

**Movement Through Space**:
- How did they get here?
- Who drives, who's passenger?
- What's visible through windows?
- Where do they sit/stand in relation to each other?
- How do they leave—together or separately?

**Seasonal Considerations**:
- What month is it?
- What's the weather doing?
- How does cold/warmth affect options?
- What's the light quality?
- How does season mirror emotion?

**Class Markers**:
- What does this space cost to access?
- Who belongs here naturally?
- What's maintained how (professional vs DIY)?
- What choices are visible?
- How does each character feel in this space?

## The World in Summary

**Millbrook** = Innocent past, equal footing, who they were
**Winnipeg** = Complicated present, class divides, who they're becoming
**His River Heights Home** = Wealth, pressure, performance
**Her Fort Garry Home** = Comfort, acceptance, authenticity
**School** = Social hierarchy, forced proximity, witnesses
**His Hockey World** = Elite, expensive, crushing expectations
**Her Badminton World** = Balanced, multicultural, sustainable
**Neutral Spaces** = Where they can choose who to be
**His Truck** = Mobile sanctuary, honest conversations
**Winter** = Pressure, isolation, forced intimacy
**Spring** = Revelation, hope, transformation
**The City Itself** = Map of their relationship

Every street holds a memory. Every location tells truth about class, pressure, choice, and love. The world isn't backdrop—it's character, obstacle, enabler, and ultimately, the stage where they figure out who they are together and separately.

Built with specificity. Grounded in reality. Ready for their story to unfold.
