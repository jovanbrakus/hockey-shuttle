# The Boy Who Knew Me First - Character Portrait Prompts

## Overview
Character portraits for inline use in Wattpad chapters, character sheets, or promotional character introductions. These should capture personality, be YA-appropriate, and allow readers to connect with characters while leaving some room for imagination.

**Key Principles**:
- Age-appropriate (actually look 17, not 25-year-old models)
- Diverse and authentic representation
- Multiple variations for different emotional states
- Consistent across series
- High quality but not overly polished

## Character Consistency Guidelines

### Maintaining Character Recognition Across Series

#### Save Seeds and Parameters
For each character, document:
- Exact prompt used
- Seed number (if available)
- Any specific style references
- Color grading approach
- Lighting setup

#### Consistent Features to Maintain
**Sophia**:
- Dark hair (length can vary with time)
- Expressive intelligent eyes
- Athletic but not bulky build
- Practical style (function over fashion)
- Subtle East Asian features

**Ethan**:
- Short dark hair (hockey-appropriate)
- Athletic build but still teenage
- Strong features but not too mature
- Height advantage visible
- Expressions range: performed confidence → authentic vulnerability

**Supporting Cast**:
- Keep core features consistent
- Allow for natural variation (hairstyles, clothing)
- Maintain personality-appropriate expressions

---

## Technical Quality Standards

### Resolution Requirements
- **Character sheets**: 1024x1536px minimum
- **Inline Wattpad use**: 512x768px minimum
- **Promotional**: 2048x3072px ideal
- **Always maintain aspect ratio**: 2:3 for portraits

### File Format
- Save as PNG for highest quality
- Keep JPEG for web optimization
- Maintain high-res originals

### Editing and Refinement
- Consider running through face restoration tools
- Subtle color grading for consistency
- Ensure age appropriate (de-age if needed)
- Remove any unwanted artifacts
- Maintain natural skin texture (no over-smoothing)

---

## Prompt Refinement Tips

### If Characters Look Too Old
Add: "high school senior, age 17, teenage features, youthful, NOT adult model, baby face elements"

### If Not Diverse/Authentic Enough
Be more specific: "Korean-American heritage, natural Korean features, authentic representation, NOT stereotypical"

### If Too Posed/Artificial
Add: "candid, natural moment, authentic expression, editorial photography NOT stock photo"

### If Wrong Emotional Tone
Specify: "contemplative not sad," "confident not arrogant," "friendly not flirty"

---

## Expression Library

### Sophia's Range
1. **Analytical**: Studying something, calculating
2. **Vulnerable**: Guard down, honest emotion
3. **Determined**: Athletic focus, competition mode
4. **Flustered**: Around Ethan, caught off-guard
5. **Content**: Rare peaceful moment
6. **Guarded**: New social situation, walls up

### Ethan's Range
1. **Performance Smile**: For the crowd
2. **Real Smile**: With Sophia, authentic
3. **Exhausted**: Weight of expectations
4. **Conflicted**: Duty vs. desire
5. **Focused**: On ice, in element
6. **Vulnerable**: Masks down, truth showing

---

## Clothing Guidance

### Sophia's Style
- **Athletic**: Team badminton gear (simple, functional)
- **School**: Comfortable casual (flannels, simple sweaters, jeans)
- **Winter**: Practical Canadian winter wear (real warmth, not fashion)
- **Avoid**: Overly trendy, impractical, too fashionable

### Ethan's Style
- **Athletic**: Hockey practice jerseys, team gear
- **School**: Casual athletic (henley shirts, simple jeans, hoodies)
- **Winter**: Hockey jacket or practical winter coat
- **Avoid**: Too preppy, overly styled, fashion model aesthetic

### General Principles
- **Age-appropriate**: What 17-year-olds actually wear
- **Regional-appropriate**: Canadian winter functional
- **Character-appropriate**: Reflects personality
- **Not distracting**: Clothing supports character, doesn't dominate

---

## Diversity and Representation Notes

### Best Practices
1. **Specificity over generalization**: "Korean-American" not just "Asian"
2. **Research respectfully**: Understand features, avoid caricature
3. **Natural not stereotypical**: Authentic human representation
4. **Consult if unsure**: Better to ask than assume
5. **Multiple attempts**: First generation might not be perfect
6. **Listen to feedback**: Especially from represented communities

### What to Avoid
- Stereotypical features
- Exoticization
- Overly Westernized versions of ethnic features
- Colorism (too light-skinned representations)
- Cultural costume unless character-specific
- Monolithic representation (diversity within diversity)

---

## Character Portrait Usage

### Within Wattpad Chapters
- Chapter openers featuring POV character
- Key emotional moments (character reacting)
- Character introduction sections
- Tension moments (close-up on expression)

### External Marketing
- Character introduction posts
- "Meet the cast" graphics
- Character playlists visual
- Mood boards

### Character Development Documents
- Character sheets for consistency
- Visual reference for series continuity
- Style guide for potential adaptations
- Merchandise concepts (if series grows)

---

## Alternative Styles to Consider

### If Photorealistic Isn't Working

**Style 1: Illustrated Portraits**
```
Add to prompt: "digital illustration style, Charlie Bowater aesthetic, painterly but detailed, contemporary illustration"
```

**Style 2: Sketch-Style Portraits**
```
Add to prompt: "pencil sketch style, detailed character art, concept art aesthetic, black and white or minimal color"
```

**Style 3: Semi-Realistic**
```
Add to prompt: "semi-realistic digital art, WLOP style, detailed but slightly stylized, contemporary character design"
```

### Benefits of Each
- **Photorealistic**: Market appeal, YA cover standards, professional
- **Illustrated**: Artistic, allows more imagination, easier consistency
- **Sketch**: Behind-the-scenes feel, development aesthetic, accessible
- **Semi-realistic**: Balance of appeal and stylization, forgiving

---

## Batch Generation Strategy

### For Consistency
1. Generate all main character portraits in one session
2. Use similar prompts with character-specific variations
3. Same lighting approach across all
4. Consistent style references
5. Similar color grading

### For Variety
1. Generate 10+ variations per character
2. Select best 3-5 for different contexts
3. Save all parameters for future consistency
4. Test in actual Wattpad layout
5. Get feedback from beta readers

---

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### AI Art Rights
- Check your AI tool's commercial use terms
- Save all generation parameters
- Consider commissioning human artist for final refinement
- Be transparent about AI generation if asked

### Model Release
- AI-generated faces don't require model releases
- But consider ethical implications
- Avoid generating faces that too closely resemble real people
- Create original characters, not copies

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Consult sensitivity readers from represented cultures
- Be open to feedback and willing to regenerate
- Intent matters, but impact matters more
- When in doubt, hire cultural consultants

## Final Character Portrait Checklist

## Character Evolution Notes

As series progresses:
- Characters can age slightly (senior year → graduation)
- Hairstyles can change (time passing)
- Expressions can evolve (growth)
- But core features must remain consistent
- Document any intentional changes

The goal is readers recognize these characters as THEIR characters - the ones they've been reading about, the ones they've invested in. Consistency builds that connection.
