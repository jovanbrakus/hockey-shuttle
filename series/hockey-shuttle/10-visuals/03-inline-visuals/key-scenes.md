## Scene Illustration Guidelines

### Composition Principles

#### Rule of Thirds
- Place key emotional elements at intersection points
- Use negative space intentionally
- Lead eye to emotional focus

#### Depth of Field
- Shallow DOF for intimate moments
- Deeper DOF for environmental storytelling
- Blur to direct attention

#### Lighting as Emotion
- **Golden hour**: Hope, warmth, romance
- **Blue hour**: Longing, distance, winter
- **Harsh fluorescent**: Reality, school, social performance
- **Warm interior**: Safety, intimacy, connection
- **Backlight**: Drama, significance, pivotal moments

### Color Theory for Scenes

#### Emotional Color Palettes
- **Early episodes**: Cooler blues, distance
- **Middle episodes**: Mixed warm/cold, conflict
- **Later episodes**: Warmer golds, resolution approaching
- **Finale**: Balanced warm and cool, harmony

#### Season Progression
- Fall: Warm oranges, change
- Winter: Blues and whites, isolation and intimacy
- Early spring: Melting, lighter blues, golds emerging

### Character Positioning

#### Physical Distance = Emotional Distance
- Early scenes: Space between characters
- Middle scenes: Closer but barriers (tables, objects)
- Later scenes: Physically close, minimal barriers
- Finale: Finally touching, barriers dissolved

#### Body Language
- **Sophia**: Arms crossed (guarded) → open posture
- **Ethan**: Performed confidence → authentic relaxation
- **Together**: Initially angled away → facing each other

## Notes on Visual Storytelling

### What Illustrations Should Do
- Enhance emotional experience
- Provide visual anchors for memory
- Create shareable moments
- Deepen reader immersion
- Celebrate pivotal scenes

### What Illustrations Shouldn't Do
- Replace imagination completely
- Spoil surprises (place carefully)
- Distract from text
- Contradict reader's mental images too drastically
- Over-explain subtle moments

### The Balance
Great scene illustrations illuminate without limiting. They show one interpretation while leaving room for reader imagination. They celebrate the story without replacing the storytelling.

---

The goal: Create visual moments that readers want to revisit, share, and remember. Illustrations that feel like they captured the exact emotional truth of the scene.
