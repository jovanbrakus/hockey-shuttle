## Notes on Atmospheric Storytelling

### The Power of Absence
Atmospheric images without characters:
- Allow reader imagination space
- Create mood without dictating specifics
- More versatile across scenes
- Less likely to contradict reader's mental images
- Timeless (characters don't age/change)

### When to Use vs. Character Images
- **Use atmospheric**: Mood setting, transitions, ongoing tone
- **Use character images**: Key emotional moments, turning points, climactic scenes

### Building Series Identity
Consistent atmospheric elements across episodes create:
- Visual recognition (readers know it's Hockey Shuttle)
- Professional cohesion
- Brand identity for series growth
- Memorable aesthetic signature

---

The goal: Create a rich visual atmosphere that readers can fall into. Images that smell like cold air and hot chocolate, that sound like skates on ice and shuttlecocks hitting racquets, that feel like Winnipeg winter and slow-burn longing.

Atmosphere isn't just background—it's the emotional weather of your story.
