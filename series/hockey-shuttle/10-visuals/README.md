## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Rights & Usage
- **Check AI tool's terms**: Ensure commercial use allowed
- **Save all parameters**: Document generation process
- **Consider human refinement**: AI as tool, not replacement
- **Be transparent**: Disclose AI use if asked

### Representation & Diversity
- **Research respectfully**: Understand features, avoid caricature
- **Be specific**: "Korean-American" not just "Asian"
- **Consult sensitivity readers**: Especially for represented communities
- **Listen to feedback**: Be willing to regenerate if harmful

### Character Consistency
- **Save seeds**: For generating same character multiple times
- **Document features**: What defines each character visually
- **Test consistency**: Generate character in different contexts
- **Build character style guide**: For future seasons

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Characters Look Too Old"
**Add to prompt**: "age 17, high school senior, teenage features, youthful, NOT adult model, baby-faced"

### "Not Diverse/Authentic Enough"
**Be more specific**: Include specific heritage, research authentic features, avoid stereotypes

### "Too Posed/Stock Photo Look"
**Add to prompt**: "candid moment, natural, editorial photography NOT stock photo, authentic expression"

### "Wrong Emotional Tone"
**Adjust mood keywords**: "contemplative not sad," "confident not arrogant," "intimate not explicit"

### "Inconsistent Between Generations"
**Use seeds**: Save successful generation seeds, use similar prompts, maintain technical settings

### "Wrong Setting/Time Period"
**Be specific**: "contemporary 2024, modern, current day, NOT vintage, NOT futuristic"

## Final Notes

These prompts are starting points, not prescriptions. AI art generation is inherently iterative and experimental. Don't expect perfect results on first attempt. Generate dozens of variations, select the best, refine, and iterate.

The goal isn't perfection—it's creating visual assets that:
- Enhance reader experience
- Represent characters authentically
- Market the series effectively
- Build recognizable brand identity
- Respect YA audience standards
- Create emotional resonance

**Most importantly**: These visuals serve the story. They should illuminate, not overshadow. Enhance, not replace. Celebrate, not dominate.

Let the story lead. Let the visuals follow.
