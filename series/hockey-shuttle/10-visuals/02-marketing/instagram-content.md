## GRID POST 5: Location Aesthetic - Winnipeg

Showcase unique Canadian setting, appeal to local readers

### MidJourney Prompt
```
Winnipeg winter aesthetic collage for Instagram, The Forks historic site, frozen Red River, city lights at dusk, cozy coffee shop windows, ice rink scenes, prairie winter sky, professional travel photography style, romantic and atmospheric not harsh, teal blue and gold hour lighting, multiple images artfully composed, Canadian winter beauty, contemporary aesthetic --ar 4:5 --v 6

### Caption Template
```
Set in WINNIPEG, MANITOBA ❄️

Real locations. Real winter. Real hockey culture.

The Forks where rivers meet.
Bell MTS Iceplex where dreams are made.
Prairie winter where -30°C means more indoor proximity.
(Perfect for slow burn romance, just saying.)

As someone who [knows/researched/loves] Winnipeg, I wanted to capture:
• The golden hour light that makes winter magical
• Coffee shop culture when it's too cold to be outside
• How hockey isn't just a sport here, it's identity
• That specific Manitoba cold that hurts your face but looks beautiful

Canadian setting. Canadian author. Canadian winter love story.

## Final Instagram Strategy Notes

**Authenticity Over Perfection**: YA readers value genuine over polished
**Community Over Promotion**: Engage more than you post
**Value Over Ads**: Every post should offer something (entertainment, emotion, info)
**Consistency Over Intensity**: Regular posts beat sporadic bursts
**Patience**: Instagram book marketing is a slow build, like the romance itself

The goal isn't viral fame - it's building a community of invested readers who will follow the series through multiple seasons.
