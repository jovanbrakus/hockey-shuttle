- **Contribute to community** beyond your own promo
- **Use appropriate flair** (usually "self-promo" or "new release")

### Don'ts
- Spam multiple subs same day
- Post and ghost (engage with comments!)
- Oversell or hype unrealistically

- Don't repost same content multiple times
- Space posts 2-4 weeks apart minimum

## Final Notes

Reddit users are savvy and can smell inauthentic marketing. The key is:
1. **Be genuinely part of the community**
2. **Offer value** (entertainment, discussion, recommendation)
3. **Be honest** about being the author
4. **Accept feedback** gracefully
5. **Don't oversell** - let the work speak

The best Reddit marketing doesn't feel like marketing at all.
