## Thumbnail Test Requirements

- 150x225px (Wattpad mobile thumbnail)
- 256x384px (Wattpad desktop thumbnail)

## Series Branding Potential

If this becomes a series, maintain:
- Color palette consistency (blues, teals, golds)
- Character positioning/silhouette recognition
- Equipment iconography (hockey stick, badminton racquet)
- Winter atmosphere
- Intimate emotional focus

Future seasons could vary:
- Different seasonal lighting (spring, summer)
- Location shifts (different Winnipeg landmarks)
- Relationship progression in body language
- Equipment changes (college team colors, etc.)

---

## Final Recommendations

- **OPTION 2 (Intimate Portrait)** if focusing on romance over sports

**Test both options** and analyze:
- Click-through rate in first week
- Reader comments on cover appeal
- Thumbnail visibility in search results
- Cross-platform performance (mobile vs desktop)

## Rights and Attribution

When generating:
- Ensure AI tool allows commercial use
- Save all generation parameters
- Keep high-resolution originals
- Document any reference images used
- Consider commissioning human artist for refinement if budget allows

---

## Prompt Iteration Tips

If first generation isn't perfect:
1. Add more specific age indicators: "high school senior 17 years old"
2. Adjust lighting: "dramatic chiaroscuro lighting" or "soft editorial lighting"
3. Refine expressions: "contemplative expression with hint of longing"
4. Clarify equipment: "professional badminton racquet Yonex style"
5. Enhance atmosphere: "Winnipeg winter golden hour through ice rink windows"

Remember: AI art requires iteration. Generate 20+ variations and select the best elements to refine into final cover.
