# Hockey Shuttle - Episode Header Images

## Overview
Episode headers appear at the top of each episode on Wattpad. They should:
- Be visually distinct but maintain series cohesion
- Capture the emotional essence of each episode
- Work well at banner dimensions (wide and short)
- Be atmospheric and evocative without being too literal
- Include subtle visual motifs that readers will recognize

**Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 21:9 for web banners
**Color Consistency**: Maintain series palette (blues, teals, golds)
**Style**: Cinematic, atmospheric, emotionally resonant

## Series Cohesion Guidelines

### Consistent Elements Across All Headers
1. **Color Palette Progression**
   - Episodes 1-3: Darker blues, limited gold
   - Episodes 4-6: High contrast, tension in colors
   - Episodes 7-9: Lighter blues, more gold appearing
   - Episode 10: Balance of warm and cold, hope

2. **Empty Space = Character Space**
   - No people in headers maintains mystery
   - Allows readers to project themselves
   - Focuses on atmosphere over literal

3. **Weather/Light Progression**
   - Follows Winnipeg seasons (late fall → winter → early spring)
   - Light becomes warmer and stronger through series
   - Mirrors emotional journey

4. **Equipment as Character**
   - Hockey and badminton elements tell story
   - Worn textures show use and time
   - Placement shows relationship dynamics

### Technical Consistency
- All use professional photography aesthetic
- Maintain depth of field approach
- Similar level of detail/grain
- Cohesive lighting styles

---

## Usage Instructions

### For Wattpad Banner Dimensions
- **Recommended**: 2560x1440px (16:9)
- **Alternative**: 2560x1080px (21:9 ultrawide)
- **Minimum**: 1920x1080px

### Placement on Wattpad
- Top of each episode
- Should work as story header
- Mobile and desktop compatible

### Text Overlay Considerations
- Leave clear space (usually center or lower third)
- Episode title placement:
  - White or gold text
  - Clean sans-serif font
  - Drop shadow for readability
  - Centered or left-aligned depending on composition

### Batch Generation Tips
1. Generate all 10 using same seed family for cohesion
2. Maintain lighting direction consistency
3. Use same color grading approach
4. Test all at same small size for consistency check

---

## Prompt Refinement Keywords

### If Too Dark
Add: "well-lit, visible detail, cinematic exposure"

### If Too Busy
Add: "minimalist, clean composition, negative space"

### If Wrong Mood
- Too happy: Add "moody, contemplative, atmospheric"
- Too sad: Add "hopeful, golden light, warmth"

### If Wrong Style
Add: "professional photography, editorial quality, cinematic, NOT cartoon, NOT anime, photorealistic"

---

## Alternative Themes

If abstract/atmospheric isn't working, consider more literal approaches:

1. **Jersey Numbers**: Close-up of jersey #11 for each episode with varying contexts
2. **Location Based**: Specific Winnipeg landmarks for each episode's key scene
3. **Equipment Evolution**: Hockey/badminton gear showing wear and story progression
4. **Weather Progression**: Pure weather/seasonal change images
5. **Architectural**: School, rink, court spaces from unique angles

---

## Final Notes

These headers should:
- Create anticipation for each episode
- Reward re-readers who see deeper symbolism
- Maintain professional quality that respects YA audience
- Work practically on Wattpad's platform
- Build series identity through repetition with variation

The goal is atmospheric storytelling that enhances without overwhelming the text itself.
