## 🏁 Final Status

**HOCKEY SHUTTLE - SEASON 1: COMPLETE** ✅

From lonely reunion to MIT arrival, from controlled teenager to emancipated adult, from hidden feelings to public love - Season 1 tells a complete story while perfectly setting up Season 2.

Sophia and Ethan fought external forces all season. Now they'll face internal choices about who they want to become and whether they can grow together instead of apart.

The hardest battles aren't always against someone. Sometimes they're about choosing between things you both want.

**They chose each other. They chose themselves. They chose MIT.**

**Now comes the real test: keeping those choices aligned.**

**Season 1:** Fighting to be together ✓
