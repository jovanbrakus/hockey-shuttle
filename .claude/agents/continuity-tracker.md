## Common Continuity Errors

### The Resurrection
**Error**: Dead character referenced as alive
**Prevention**: Death log with episode markers

### The Teleportation
**Error**: Character appears impossibly fast
**Prevention**: Location/travel tracking

### The Amnesia
**Error**: Character forgets learned information
**Prevention**: Knowledge matrix maintenance

### The Duplication
**Error**: Same reveal twice
**Prevention**: Revelation tracker

### The Time Warp
**Error**: Timeline impossibilities
**Prevention**: Strict chronology log

## Previously-On Management

### Essential Callbacks
Episode 5 needs from Episode 4:
- Cliffhanger resolution
- Emotional state
- Physical location
- Active threats
- New knowledge

### Elegant References
**Heavy-handed**: "As you'll remember from yesterday when Tom betrayed us..."
**Natural**: "Tom's empty chair felt like an accusation."

**Clunky**: "We still have the map we found in Episode 2."
**Smooth**: "She pulled out the map, its edges still singed."
