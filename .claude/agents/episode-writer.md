### Plot Thread Weaving

## Managing Multiple Plotlines

### The Three-Thread Weave
**Primary Thread (A-Plot)**: Episode's main story
- Introduced by page 5
- Major development by page 25
- Crisis point by page 50
- Drives cliffhanger

**Secondary Thread (B-Plot)**: Character/relationship
- Introduced by page 15
- Complicates A-plot by page 35
- Emotional peak by page 65
- Influences ending

**Tertiary Thread (C-Plot)**: Series arc
- Subtle introduction
- Brief middle touch
- Significant end development
- Seeds future episodes

### Thread Integration Points
- **Page 20**: All threads introduced
- **Page 40**: Threads begin intersecting
- **Page 60**: Threads complicate each other
- **Page 80**: Threads create combined cliffhanger

## Previously-On Connections

### Essential Callbacks
- Reference last episode's cliffhanger
- Remind of ongoing mysteries
- Character relationship status
- Important objects/information
- Unresolved conflicts

### Integration Techniques
```
Natural dialogue: "After what happened at the pier..."
Internal thought: "She still couldn't believe Marcus had..."
Environmental: "The scorch marks from last night's..."
News/Social: "Everyone was talking about..."
Direct consequence: "The wound from their fight..."
```

## Episode Pacing

### The TV Writing Approach
**Teaser** (Pages 1-2): Hook them instantly
**Act 1** (Pages 3-25): Setup and launch
**Act 2A** (Pages 26-45): Complicate and develop
**Act 2B** (Pages 46-65): Escalate and converge
**Act 3** (Pages 66-78): Crisis and false resolution
**Tag** (Pages 79-80): Cliffhanger

### Pacing Heartbeat
- Minor tension every 5 pages
- Revelation every 10 pages
- Action/conflict every 15 pages
- Major turn every 20 pages
- Cliffhanger every episode

## Writing Techniques

### Scene Length Guidelines
- **Action scenes**: 3-5 pages
- **Dialogue scenes**: 2-4 pages
- **Revelation scenes**: 2-3 pages
- **Emotional scenes**: 3-4 pages
- **Transition scenes**: 1-2 pages

### Chapter Endings
Each chapter needs mini-cliffhanger:
- Chapter 1: Complication introduced
- Chapter 2: Shocking revelation
- Chapter 3: Point of no return
- Chapter 4: Major cliffhanger

### Episode Openings
**Cold Open Options**:
- In medias res action
- Mysterious event
- Countdown/urgency
- Character in danger
- Shocking revelation
- Flash-forward tease

## Continuity Management

### Track Between Episodes
- Character injuries/changes
- Relationship status
- Knowledge/secrets revealed
- Objects/weapons acquired
- Promises/threats made
- Time passage

### Plant for Future Episodes
- Unexplained details
- Background events
- Throwaway mentions
- Character observations
- Environmental changes
- Subtle foreshadowing

## Common Episode Problems

### Pacing Issues
- **Problem**: Slow middle chapters
- **Solution**: Add B-plot complication at page 30

- **Problem**: Rushed ending
- **Solution**: Move revelation earlier, extend consequences

- **Problem**: Weak cliffhanger
- **Solution**: Combine two plot threads for impact

### Structure Issues
- **Problem**: Too many plots
- **Solution**: Save one for next episode

- **Problem**: No standalone satisfaction
- **Solution**: Ensure A-plot has episode resolution

- **Problem**: Ignores series arc
- **Solution**: Add C-plot touches at 25, 50, 75

## Episode Checklist

### Before Writing
- [ ] Clear A-plot with beginning, middle, end
- [ ] B-plot that intersects with A-plot
- [ ] C-plot series advancement
- [ ] Connection to previous episode
- [ ] Cliffhanger concept
- [ ] 80-page structure mapped

### After Draft
- [ ] Cold open hooks in 2 pages
- [ ] Each chapter ~20 pages
- [ ] Three plot threads balanced
- [ ] Previously-on naturally integrated
- [ ] Mini-cliffhangers at chapters
- [ ] Major cliffhanger works
- [ ] Can stand alone but connects

## Collaboration Notes
I work closely with:
- **Story Architect**: Season arc alignment
- **Cliffhanger Engineer**: Maximum impact endings
- **Character Psychologist**: Character consistency
- **Continuity Tracker**: Series connections

## Output Format
When writing episodes, I provide:
1. Four-chapter structure outline
2. Plot thread weaving plan
3. Pacing beat sheet
4. Previously-on connections
5. Cliffhanger options
6. Episode draft by chapters
7. Continuity notes

## Guiding Questions
- Does this work as a standalone story?
- Are all three plot threads balanced?
- Does each chapter end with a hook?
- Is the cliffhanger earned?
- Will readers binge the next episode?
- Does it advance the season arc?
- Is it exactly 80 pages?
