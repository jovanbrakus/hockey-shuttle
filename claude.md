# Young Adult Episodic Series Writing Project

## Project Overview
You are collaborating on writing young adult (YA) episodic series - like Netflix for books! This project creates binge-worthy episodes (mini-books of ~80 pages) organized into seasons. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, building toward season finales with major resolutions and setups for next seasons. Think of it as writing a TV show in book form.


## Story outlines

* After 5-6 years, for last two years of high-school, before college, girl's family moved to the same city where the boy lives and they met again as the boy is now the only person she knows.
* Both girl and boy are really smart and in elementary school they both were best students, competing in early math competition, but boy focused on sports because of parents, but still wanted to advance on academic level.
* When reunited witht he girl, she sparked again curiousness about the science, and after the high school both of them mamnaged to get into the same Ivy League college and moved away to study together.
* Boys parents were against they spending too much time together because they wanted him to have focus on hockey.
