## Production Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Individual Squares
1. Generate all 9 images for Sophia using consistent settings:
   - Model: MidJourney v6 or Stable Diffusion XL
   - Size: 1024x1024 minimum
   - Style: Raw/photographic
   - Keep seeds similar for color consistency

2. Generate all 9 images for Ethan with same process

### Step 2: Color Grading Consistency
In Photoshop/Lightroom:
- **Sophia**: Apply cool teal tint (+10 cyan, +5 blue)
- **Ethan**: Apply cool navy tint (+15 blue, -5 warmth, +10 contrast)
- Match white balance across all squares
- Ensure consistent saturation levels

### Step 3: Grid Assembly (Canva or Photoshop)
**Canva Method:**
1. Create 3000x3000px canvas
2. Use grid layout (3x3)
3. Add 20px gaps (optional, or go seamless)
4. Drop images into grid positions
5. Export as high-quality PNG

**Photoshop Method:**
1. Create 3000x3000px document
2. Create 3x3 grid guides
3. Place images in positions
4. Add 20px white stroke between squares (optional)
5. Export for web (PNG, high quality)

### Step 4: Optimization for Wattpad
- **Wattpad Story Cover**: 512x800px (portrait)
- **Wattpad Aesthetic Grid**: 1000x1000px works well
- **Export**: RGB, PNG, 72 DPI for web
- **Backup**: Keep 3000x3000px version for prints/merch

## Alternative: Single-Prompt Approach (If Requested)

### Sophia Chen - Full Grid Prompt
```
3x3 aesthetic collage grid for YA book character, center square is editorial portrait of 17-year-old Asian-mixed heritage athletic girl in teal hoodie, surrounding 8 squares contain: badminton racket detail, study materials with hot chocolate, ice skating close-up, shuttlecock motion, winter Winnipeg scene, athletic tape, physics star chart, worn court shoes, teal and blue color palette, cohesive lighting, Pinterest aesthetic board style, contemporary YA mood board, professional photography throughout, seamless grid layout --ar 1:1 --v 6
```

**Note:** This approach is less reliable for maintaining quality across all 9 sections and specific detail requirements.

## Tips for Best Results

### MidJourney Specific
- Use `--style raw` for more photographic results
- Use `--seed [number]` to maintain consistency across squares
- Generate 4 variations per prompt, choose best
- Use `--chaos 10` for slight variation if too similar

### Stable Diffusion Specific
- Model: Realistic Vision XL or Juggernaut XL
- Sampling: DPM++ 2M Karras, 25 steps
- CFG Scale: 7-8
- Use same seed +1 for variations
- Negative prompts are critical for clean results

### Color Consistency
- Generate all squares in one session
- Apply color grading batch in post-production
- Use color reference images for AI if possible
- Adjust white balance uniformly in Lightroom

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **AI adds text**: Add "no text, no words, no letters" to negative prompt
- **Wrong colors**: Add specific hex codes to prompt or adjust in post
- **Faces in non-portrait squares**: Emphasize "no people, no faces" in negative
- **Inconsistent style**: Use same model/settings/seed for all squares
