## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Episode 3 "Defensive Zone" has been analyzed for continuity consistency with Episodes 1 and 2. **SEVERAL CRITICAL ERRORS** have been identified that require immediate correction before publication. The most severe is a character name error that fundamentally confuses two different families.

- **MAJOR ERRORS:** 3 (timeline inconsistencies, character additions, location confusion)
- **MINOR ERRORS:** 5 (detail inconsistencies)
- **CONTINUITY STRENGTHS:** Strong character voice consistency, good emotional continuity

---

## CRITICAL ERRORS (MUST FIX)

### 1. **FAMILY NAME DISASTER - ETHAN'S PARENTS**

**ERROR TYPE:** Character Identity Confusion
**SEVERITY:** CRITICAL - This breaks fundamental character relationships

**THE PROBLEM:**

**Episode 2, Chapter 1, Line 106:**
> "Robert Hayes knows her from the athletic director meetings."

**Episode 2, Chapter 1, Line 112:**
> "Robert and Caroline Hayes, the power couple..."

**CORRECT INFORMATION (from Episodes 1 & 3):**
- Ethan's parents: **Robert and Caroline PRICE**
- Tyler's family: **The HAYES family** (Tyler Hayes, Mrs. Hayes - Tyler's mom who "adopted" Ethan)

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**
This error fundamentally confuses two different families:
1. The Price family (Ethan's controlling parents)
2. The Hayes family (Tyler's warm, welcoming parents who helped Ethan adjust to Winnipeg)

**WHERE THE ERROR APPEARS:**
- Episode 2, Chapter 1 repeatedly refers to Ethan's parents as "Hayes"
- The outline and Episode 3 correctly use "Price"

**REQUIRED FIX:**
- Find and replace all instances of "Robert Hayes" and "Caroline Hayes" with "Robert Price" and "Caroline Price" in Episode 2
- Verify no other episodes have this confusion

---

## MAJOR ERRORS (HIGH PRIORITY FIXES)

### 2. **TIMELINE INCONSISTENCY**

**Episode 1 Timeline (Established):**
- Saturday, Sept 4: Sophia moves to Winnipeg
- Sunday, Sept 5: Unpacking, preparations
- Monday, Sept 6 (First Day): St. Paul's, reunites with Ethan
- Tuesday, Sept 7: First calculus class
- Wednesday, Sept 8: The Forks visit, badminton practice
- Friday, Sept 9: Hockey game
- Sunday, Sept 11: Skating + Instagram drama

**Episode 2 Timeline (STATED):**
- Outline says: "Late September - Early October (weeks 3-4 of junior year)"
- Summary says: "Timeline: Late September - Early October (3-4 weeks into junior year)"

**Episode 2, Chapter 1 Opening (CONFUSING):**
- Line 4: "Two weeks ago, Sophia Chen returned to Winnipeg after six years away"
- Line 39: "She'd been in Winnipeg three weeks"
- These contradict each other

**Episode 3 Timeline (STATED):**
- Outline says: "Mid-October to early November (weeks 6-8 of junior year)"
- Summary says: "Timeline: Mid-October through early January"
- Chapter 1 opens Monday morning after "Sunday night" (The Forks confession from Ep 2 end)

**ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
1. Episode 2 Chapter 1 says "two weeks ago" but also "three weeks" - which is it?
2. If Episode 2 is weeks 3-4 and Episode 3 is weeks 6-8, where is week 5?
3. Episode 3's summary says "through early January" but outline says "early November"
4. Need clearer temporal markers

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Create a master timeline document showing:
- Episode 1: Week 1 of junior year (Sept 4-11)
- Episode 2: Weeks 3-4 of junior year (Sept 20-Oct 7) [2 weeks after Ep 1 ends]
- Episode 3: Weeks 6-8 of junior year (Oct 14-Nov 4)

Fix the "two weeks ago" vs "three weeks" contradiction in Episode 2, Chapter 1.

### 3. **MYSTERIOUS BROTHER APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS**

**Episode 2, Chapter 1, Lines 257-281:**
Sophia arrives home and her "little brother David" is introduced:
> "her little brother David was sprawled on the couch"

**THE PROBLEM:**
- David is **NEVER mentioned in Episode 1** during any family scenes
- David **doesn't appear in Episode 3**
- Episode 1, Chapter 1 establishes Sophia as an only child (parents focus entirely on her)
- No other references to siblings exist in the series

**REQUIRED FIX:**
- Either remove David from Episode 2 entirely (RECOMMENDED)
- OR add David retroactively to Episode 1 family scenes and continue referencing him throughout

**RECOMMENDATION:** Remove David. The story works better with Sophia as an only child facing parental academic pressure.

### 4. **LOCATION LOGIC ERROR**

**Episode 1, Chapter 4, Lines 498-500:**
> "This is where I used to come when I first moved here," Ethan said. "Before AAA and elite training and all that. When it was still just... fun."

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Ethan moved TO Winnipeg at age 9 specifically FOR AAA hockey
- He didn't have a "before AAA and elite training" period IN Winnipeg
- The community rink would have been where he went DURING AAA training, not before

**WHAT IT SHOULD SAY:**
"This is where I used to come when I first moved here. Before it all got too serious. When it was still just... fun."

OR

"This is where I used to come between practices. Where I could just skate without coaches watching."

---

## MINOR ERRORS (SHOULD FIX)

### 5. **Becca's Last Name Varies**

**Episode 1:** Consistently "Becca Martinez"
**Episode 2:** Mostly "Becca Martinez" but one instance of "Becca Morrison"
**Episode 3:** Back to "Martinez"

**REQUIRES:** Search and replace to ensure consistent "Becca Martinez" throughout all episodes.

### 6. **Ethan's Birthday Date Inconsistency**

**Episode 3 Outline, Line 767:**
> "Ethan turns 18 (December 26 or 27?)"

The outline itself is uncertain. This needs to be decided and tracked.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Choose December 26 (Boxing Day) as it's memorable and close to the December 28 departure date referenced.

### 7. **School Name Confusion**

**Episode 2, Chapter 1, Line 295:**
Reference to "Westwood High hallways" when discussing overheard conversations.

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The school is **St. Paul's High School**
- "Westwood High" appears nowhere else in the series
- This may be a copy-paste error from another story

**REQUIRED FIX:** Change "Westwood High" to "St. Paul's"

### 8. **Badminton Tournament Timing**

**Episode 1, Chapter 3, Line 496:**
> "First tournament is in three weeks—Grand Forks, North Dakota"

**Episode 2:**
- Multiple references to a tournament "in five days" (Friday)
- "Saturday's tournament"
- This IS the badminton tournament where Sophia wins silver

**Episode 3, Chapter 3:**
- References "Provincial badminton championships weekend"
- Sophia wins silver medal, qualifies for nationals

**CONFUSION:**
- Is this the same tournament or different ones?
- "Grand Forks, North Dakota" is never mentioned again
- The tournament that happens is called "Provincial Championships"

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Clarify that the "Grand Forks" tournament mentioned in Episode 1 was either:
- Cancelled/postponed, OR
- Was a mis-statement, OR
- Was a different tournament that happens off-page

The "Provincial Championships" is the major tournament.

### 9. **Age Confirmation Needed**

**Episode 1:** Both characters are 17, junior year (Grade 11)
**Episode 3 Outline:** References Ethan turning 18 in December

**QUESTION:** When is Sophia's birthday? Is she also turning 18 this year, or is she younger?

**For Series Bible:** Establish exact birthdates for both characters.

## TIMELINE VERIFICATION (DETAILED)

### EPISODE 1: "Returning to Center Ice"
**Week 1 of Junior Year: September 4-11**

| Day | Date | Events |
|-----|------|--------|
| Saturday | Sept 4 | Sophia moves to Winnipeg |
| Sunday | Sept 5 | Unpacking, outfit planning, Instagram stalking |
| Monday | Sept 6 | First day St. Paul's, reunites with Ethan, meets Becca |
| Tuesday | Sept 7 | Calculus class, texts with Ethan |
| Wednesday | Sept 8 | The Forks visit (coffee, river overlook, Mrs. Reyes), badminton practice (meets Maya, beats her 11-9) |
| Thursday | Sept 9 | Badminton practice mentioned |
| Friday | Sept 9 | **ERROR** - Should be Sept 9 |
| Friday Night | Sept 9 | Hockey game (St. Paul's vs Fort Richmond, 5-2 win), parking lot scene |
| Saturday | Sept 10 | Ethan texts about Sunday skating |
| Sunday | Sept 11 | Community rink skating, Instagram post, drama erupts |

**✓ VERIFIED:** Episode 1 timeline is internally consistent.

### EPISODE 2: "New Lines"
**Supposed to be Weeks 3-4 of Junior Year: Late September**

**PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:**
- Chapter 1 says "Two weeks ago" (would make it Sept 25)
- Chapter 1 also says Sophia has "been here three weeks" (would make it Sept 27ish)
- Outline says "weeks 3-4" (would be Sept 18-Oct 1)
- The Instagram drama from Ep 1 end needs to be resolved

**NEEDS CLARIFICATION:**
- How much time passed between Episode 1 and Episode 2?
- What happened to resolve the Instagram drama?
- When exactly does Episode 2 begin?

**Chapter 4 Timeline (Last part of Episode 2):**
- Wednesday: Sophia overhears conversation about being set up
- Friday: Badminton tournament (Sophia wins silver)
- Saturday evening: The Forks confession
- Sunday: Becca sees them, walks away

### EPISODE 3: "Defensive Zone"
**Weeks 6-8 of Junior Year: Mid-October to early November**

**Chapter 1:** Monday morning after The Forks confession (immediately follows Ep 2)
- Monday: Tim Hortons meeting, school reactions, parents' ultimatum revealed
- Week progresses: Setting boundaries, trying to navigate

**Chapter 2:**
- Week of "more than friends, less than dating"
- Wednesday night game (he loses without her)
- Weekend study session

**Chapter 3:**
- "Last weekend of October" - Provincial Championships
- Saturday tournament (silver medal)
- Sunday: Stella's celebration, Becca appears with new guy
- Monday: Academic awards assembly

**Chapter 4:**
- "Halloween" (early November)
- Jordan's party
- Father arrives, roster spot threatened
- Cliffhanger: Prep school mentioned

**TIMELINE ISSUE:**
- Chapter 3 says "last weekend of October"
- Chapter 4 is "Halloween" (October 31)
- But outline says this spans "mid-October to early November"
- These are very close together

**✓ MOSTLY COHERENT** but compressed timeline may feel rushed.

## CONCLUSION

Episode 3 "Defensive Zone" maintains strong character continuity and emotional coherence with Episodes 1 and 2. However, **one critical error** (parent naming) and several major errors (timeline, character additions, location logic) require immediate correction before publication.

The good news: These are all fixable with search-and-replace or minor dialogue adjustments. The bones of the story are solid, and the emotional/character continuity is excellent.

1. Parent name error (Hayes → Price)
2. Brother David issue (remove or integrate)
3. Tyler name error (Chen → Hayes)

**HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Soon):**
4. Timeline clarification
5. Location logic in skating scene
6. School name error

7. Becca surname consistency
8. Jordan surname decision
